																								<h2>Our Vision</h2>
																								<p><b>Medic Assist International exists to save and enhance the lives of vulnerable, poor&#160;or oppressed people through the provision of healthcare by indigenous people of vision, integrity and competence.</b></p><p>Our&#160;vision is not to have hundreds of projects carrying&#160;the MAI&#160;name around the globe. Most people receiving treatments will not recognize&#160;our logo.</p><p>Rather, our vision is to empower and enable local people to provide healthcare facilities and services by providing start up funding and support from UK volunteers.</p><div><a href="http://www.medic-assist.org/what-we-do.php" target="_self">More Information </a></div>											</div>
