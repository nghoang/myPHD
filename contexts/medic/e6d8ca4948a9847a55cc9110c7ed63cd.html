	  <h2>Overview</h2>
      
      <p>MEDIC has been set up to address the gaps in the medical  device concept to commercialisation continuum.</p>
            
            <p>MEDIC has  three  areas of focus and the growth strategy for MEDIC will result in a diverse set of skills capable of bringing a product / technology idea from concept through to design transfer. 
Product / Technology design transfer will be to a commercialisation entity - external company or Campus  Company.</p>

			<p>MEDIC's long term growth strategy will be achieved by developing the following capabilities:</p>
            	<ol>
                	<li class="ordered">Research expertise in the areas of Smart  Devices, Assistive Rehabilitation and Biomaterials</li>

                    <li class="ordered">Process development  - through technology and product concept development as well as innovation partner ships with local companies</li>
                    <li class="ordered">Concept development engineering</li>
                    <li class="ordered">Medical device product development and commercialisation</li>
                    <li class="ordered">Technical and clinical project management</li>
                </ol>
            <p>In addition to the skill sets within the MEDIC team, we  leverage other expertise as needed in areas such legal (IP), regulatory, commercialisation  assessment and product clinical application. </p>

            
            <p>The  combination of internal and external skills provides the complete spectrum of expertise &nbsp;required to bring a product / technology from  concept to commercialisation. </p>

        <br />
        Davida  O&rsquo;Brien graduated from Cork Institute of Technology in 2009 with a Bachelor  (hons) of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering. She joined the MEDIC team in  September 2009 as a PhD candidate. &nbsp;As  part of her degree, Davida had a paper published entitled &ldquo;Evaluation of a  novel radiopacifiying agent on the physical properties of surgical spineplex&rdquo;  in Journal of Material Science: Materials in Medicine.&nbsp; <br />
Davida  has a keen interest in biomechanics and is pursuing research in this field. Her  project investigates the effect of Diabetes on ankle and foot biomechanics. Lower extremity amputation  as a result of ulceration is a feared complication among diabetics. Ulceration  begins with the onset of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) which is linked  to muscle wastage, gait misalignment and limited joint mobility. These symptoms  along with incresed body weight contribute to elevated plantar (sole of the  foot) pressures, leading to ulceration as seen in the picture.<br /> 
<img src="images/foot-ulcer.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="112" align="left" />The aim of this study is to examine the kinetics  and kinematics of the healthy foot in comparison to the Diabetic foot. These  will be investigated through performing analysis on plantar pressure  distribution, as seen in Figure 2 (Tekscan HR Mattm , Tekscan <em><a href="http://www.tekscan.com/medical/system-fscan1.html"><em>F-Scan</em></a>&reg;</em><em>),</em> lower limb muscle activity ( Zero Wire EMG ) and  gait analysis (Vicon Nexus Motion analysis, Figure 3). It  is anticipated that the research undertaken will contribute to future ulcer  prevention devices and/ or therapies.<br />

  </strong><br />
        Michael Hellen graduated  from the University of Limerick in 2008with a BSc in Applied Physics.  Throughout his four year degree he obtained industrial work experience and  studied many fields such as electronics and medical physics and developed a  keen interest and passion for medical device research and development grew.<br />
In 2009, Michael  graduated with an MSc  in Biomedical Engineering which  provided him with a broader knowledge base of the biomedical sector. As he  always had a real fervor for research, he decided to pursue a PhD with MEDIC at  the Cork Institute of Technology. </p>
     <p> His research involves  using 3D motion analysis to the assess motor and gait deficiencies in people  with Spina Bifida. His research involves identifying the main muscle groups  that contribute to the gait deficiencies caused by spina bifida. Pin pointing  the muscle groups will allow them to be targeted in the production and  development of assistive technology/devices.&nbsp;  Michael is motivated and inspired by making a difference and improving  the quality of life of people with spina bifida as well as those who care for  them.&nbsp; By studying at CIT and working  with top class engineers, researchers and staff at MEDIC, he can access both  technical and clinical expertise as well as a state of the art gait laboratory.  Michael&rsquo;s vision is that at the end of his three year PhD program, the  knowledge base for spina bifida gait disorder aetiology will have improved and that  further work will lead to the development of new medical devices which have a  direct and positive impact on the lives of the children with spina bifida and their  families.</p>

   </strong><br />
        Shona Cunningham graduated with a Bachelor of  Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering from the Cork Institute of  Technology (CIT) in 2009 and is one the three MEDIC PhD students. Shona is  currently undertaking a project in the Smart Devices research strand of MEDIC,  in collaboration with the National Marine College of Ireland (NMCI). Her PhD  project focuses on scuba diving equipment known as a closed circuit rebreather  (CCR) which allows deep sea divers to dive deeper with less equipment and for  longer durations. This technology has become prevalent over recent years, but  significant research is required to improve the technology. The CCR technology  conserves expensive helium by recycling the breathing gas, by passing it  through a carbon dioxide chemical scrubber and topping the resultant scrubbed  gas up with pure oxygen to maintain the oxygen content. </p>
     <p><br />
       <img src="images/Shona-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="310" hspace="50" vspace="10" align="middle" /><br />
       The research challenge is to redesign the  carbon dioxide scrubber unit (Fig.1) whilst developing a gas detection system  monitoring carbon dioxide. The technology would allow more efficient  decompression information and provide a safe means of monitoring and carbon  dioxide. The Cork Institute of  Technology and MEDIC, offer state of the art facilities needed for this project, as well as  prototyping facilities for manufacturing parts and chemistry laboratories for  access and testing of breathing simulation components. <strong><u></u></strong></p>
