<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The Ranger it is in perfect condition, there&#8217;s not a scratch or any dents on it. Everything from engine to tires is mint condition. I have a clear title with no liens or loans. I&#8217;m selling it so low due the fact that my medical team will deploy back to Afghanistan on March 15th for a 2 year contract and I won&#8217;t let it go to waste in my backyard, therefore I need a fast and reliable buyer. If you are interested email me back.</p>
<p>A few words about the truck:<br />
- 2001 Ford Ranger 4&#215;4 SuperCab XLT<br />
- Mileage: 50,487<br />
- Price: $2,410<br />
- Transmission: Automatic<br />
- Engine: 4.0L V6<br />
- Drive Type : All wheel drive<br />

						<p>((This is his 2nd email, after he states the truck is local.. yep a scammer !!!!! ) </p>
<p>He has it as a Ford Ranger 2002 for $1997, with 50,000 miles. </p>
<p>I am in a currently stationed at Nevada Army National Guard. We are getting ready for Afghanistan. We are in the final stage of our training and we are not allowed to use the phone during this period. This is supposed to keep us focused on our trainings. I am only allowed to check my email few times a day. I hope you can understand that we will have to stick to email for now. The vehicle is here with me at the base but IÕve already made all the arrangements with DAS to pick it up from the base. DAS will also handle the title transfer for an extra $75.00. Being in the army has some advantages and one of them is the fact that I can ship it very cheap. I will pay for the shipping charges, as IÕve said in my first email. I think I can have it there in 3-5 business days.<br />
I am a member of the eBay buyer protection program and using this service you will give a 5 days testing period after delivery. During that 5 days testing period I will not be getting any money. I need to know if you are interested in buying it so I can ask eBay to send you the details on how this works. I have to fill out a form on eBay and I need the name that will go on the title and an address where you want the car delivered. Once I do it, eBay will email you all the details on this transaction and we can get the ball rolling.</p>

If you are interested email me back.</p>

						<p>It&#8217;s funny that I see all this because I came across the same scam in Michigans craigslist for the same 2002 altima.  What&#8217;s really funny is that I do work for the Department of Defense and verified in our DoD system that this guy is not a Sgt 1st Class or a medic or even military at that matter.  I have reported it to the authorities!!!</p>
