<h2><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Bard's guide to a better Medic</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The medic is one of those &quot;mediocre&quot;
classes.. that is until you learn the full potential of this class. The medic is an
excellent support class and makes an excellent roaming defender. The fact that the medic
can pump-up players health while wandering about, infect enemy and can chase invading
players in a similar fashion to the pyro makes him an often underestimated part of a
defensive team. The medic comes equipped with a bio-weapon, super nailgun, super shotty,
normal and concussion grenades, decent armour, regenerating health and good speed.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">General tips</font></strong>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">When healing a friendly player a single swipe with
    the bio-weapon will bring them up to full health, further hits increase their health above
    their maximum by 5 points per hit. This extra health drops down to the normal level over
    time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The bio-weapon infects enemy players with a
    &quot;tropical disease&quot;, that will infect any player who comes into contact with the
    infected person. This is especially handy on public servers when you are attacking and can
    often cause the enemy to switch their classes to overcome your actions. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Concussion grenades are excellent for their normal
    use of concussing the enemy. Another advanced use for them is in &quot;concussion
    jumps&quot;. Using this tactic you can often reach areas not normally accessible to get
    around enemy defenders. This is used extensively in well6 by skilled attackers.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Offense</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The medic can be a real pain to defenders when on
the offense, infecting them with the bio-weapon and generally causing havoc. Often the
medic's role is a simply to concussion jump up to an unexpected place and capture the
flag. This is normally done through using a concussion jump to bypass the defenders,
concuss anyone else that manages to get in the way and&nbsp; kill any sentry guns using
normal grenades before nabbing the flag and getting out of there. </font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Defense</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Roaming defender is probably the best role for a
medic on defense. Moving about pumping up the health of team mates and assisting at any
enemy intrusions. A favorite tactic is to concuss someone just as they wander into a
sentry gun :) </font></p>
