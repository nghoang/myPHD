      <p><a name="falkusa"></a>The
earliest known description of a sporting event in Croatia is from the
16th century. It reffered to the <strong>1593
regatta</strong> of seventy four
(yes, 74)
wooden fishing boats
called <a
 href="http://www.adriatica.net/guide/croatia/feature/beautiful_destinations_en.htm"
 target="_blank">falkusa</a>,
from the harbour of the town of Komiza on the island of Vis to the
islet of Palagruza.
It was <font color="#ff0000">the
oldest known boat race in
Europe</font>. Falkusa is
autochthonous Croatian boat of 9m of length, with the mast
of
equal size, in use from 11th or 12th century until the middle of the
20th century.
A
crew
was composed of
five
rowers,
and
the
marathon
covered
42
miles,
for which about five to fifteen hours of continuous and exhausting
rowing was
necessary, depending on weather conditions. </p>

      <p>The very start of the
marathon of the armada was announced by a cannon from the Renaissance
tower in the Komiza harbour early in the morning of 20th May. One can
imagine the foam raised by 74 boats and 370 rows in the harbour! The
description of this interesting event is kept in the Liber Comissiae in
the parish of the town of Vis on the island of Vis. In 1998 falkusa was
included into the UNESCO World Heritage List.

      <p>The next earliest known
description of a sporting event in Croatia is from the 18th century
(1764). It referred to the regatta of two fishing boats representing
the cities of Split and Makarska, from an islet near Milna on the
island of Brac to the Split harbour. It was the Makaran boat that
triumphed! </p>
      <p>One of truly fascinating

to <a href="arctic.html">ARCTIC

organized by the then Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
The Croats at that time had the status of <a

within the Empire. </p>
      <p>The first international
football (soccer) match where Croatia participated with its national
name had been held in 1907 (with Czechia). The <b>Croatian
Sporting Union</b> was founded in
Zagreb in 1909. In 1911 the Croatian representation participated under
its flag (and with its national name) on the European championship in
Torino. In 1912 <b>Franjo Gregl</b>

began to play football in Zupanja</a>,
a small Croatian town near Danube river. Since there were only nine of
the Englishmen who came to Croatia several years before, they invited
local boys to join them. In 1914, professional coaches from England
came to Croatia. James Donelly and Arthur Gaskhell, who were the
coaches in "Gradjanski" club in Zagreb that in 1936 defeated famous

Austria-Hungary. When the Subotica Gymnastic Society (Suboticko

prizes in all disciplines. Furthermore, the newspapers reported that
"...the Subotica sportsmen demonstrated in Belgrade the new game called
Football, until then unknown in that city..." One of Matkovic's pupils

      <a name="mikan"></a><b>George
Mikan</b> (1924-2005), born in a
Croatian family in Illinois (his both parents are from Vivodina near <a
 href="art.html#karlovac">Karlovac</a>,
in the region of Zumberak),
was
the best basketball player in the USA in 1944. He was the first
dominant "big man" in NBA, known as the "Gentle Giant" (208 cm, or 6
feet 10 inches). He was also one of the most effective scorers of his
time, averaging 22.6 points per game over his nine years long
professional career, with the then <font color="#ff0000">record of
11,764 points</font>.
The Associated Press voted Mikan the greatest basketball player of the
first half of the 20th century. When Mikan's LA Lakers came to Madison
Square Garden, the marquee simply advertized <i>"Tonight
George Mikan versus the Knicks!"</i>.
How basketball was played at that time, is indicated by the following:
he lost four teeth (in his first professional game), had two broken
legs, three broken fingers, broken wrist, broken nose and dozens of
stitches. Even some NBA rules have been changed because of his
superiority. George Mikan was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest
Players in 1996 (on the occasion of 50 years of NBA), played four NBA
all-star games, and is in the <font color="#ff0000">Basketball Hall of

2005: We have fond memories of George Mikan in my family. He was a
towering man with a big heart, and a faith in God that carried him
through many rough times. He needed a special car so that he could fit
into it. When he came to visit at our house he had to duck to get into
our house, and into our car, and garage. My father, a dear friend of
George was 5'8 inches tall, and George was 6'7" tall. When the two
stood next to one another, they were the true mutt and Jeff. George was
a man of great faith, and I know that Sam and George are in heaven
practicing law together, and talking about their love of sports. I will
always remember George Mikans smile and what a great friend he was to
my dad. When my dad was dying, Dad didn't want to see anyone, but
George didn't care, he came into the hospital to see his friend Sam,
and I remember my father's eyes lighting up, and that my Dad felt good
enough that day to have a long conversation with his friend George. In
my family we were taught to always call our elders, Mr and Mrs., so I
did. When I was in my 30's George told me to call him George. I told
him I just didn't think I could do that. He laughed and made me!! His
nickname for me was "the favorite one". I will always remember him.</font></p>

 target="_blank">Helen Crlenkovich</a>
(1921-1955) was one of the most successful athletes in America and the
world on the three-meter springboard and the ten-meter platform. She
was an American-born Croatian lovingly known as "Klinky." Her best
sports years began in the late 1930's. She not only became the best
American, but also the world springboard and platform diving champion.
She was the first female to do a full-twisting 1 1/2 somersault and
several other dives that were heretofore only achieved by men. Helen
was chosen to represent America in the 1940 Olympic Games. All
concerned felt that Helen would achieve two gold medals as a minimum.
However, because of the onset of the Second World War, the games were
cancelled. She was also honored by being inducted into the Helms
Foundation Diving Hall of Fame in California. In September 2008, Helen
received post-mortem recognition by the World Acrobatic Congress held
in Las Vegas for her life achievements in swimming and diving. She died
very young out of cancer. Her both parents are from Croatia: mother
Anka Tomin is from Petrijevci, and father Adam from Banicevac. (Text by
dr. Ante Chuvalo, Chicago).</p>
      <p><font size="-1">An interesting note as regards Helen is the
fact that her trainer, Phil Patterson, insistently urged this young
Croatian-American woman to change her name to something that is "more
suitable." He told Helen that with a name like Crlenkovich, she will
not achieve any hoped-for success. Nonetheless, Helen, just as
insistently, rejected his suggestion because she was proud of her
Croatian name and heritage. This fact speaks volumes as to the strength
of her character.</font></p>

suicide after that. Having remarried, he now tours Canada and the USA,
accompanied with his remaining son Steven, giving lectures for pupils,

Croatia, May 19- Water polo is a national obsession in this beautiful
Dalmatian coast port city, but it had been twenty years since Jug, the
local club, had won the European Champions league. For the six thousand
lucky souls who got tickets to the Gruz swimming stadium for this
year's "Final Four," the championship game of professional water polo's
premier event was a night to remember. The atmosphere at European water
polo matches is unlike any event staged in the United States. Drums,
air horns, flares and constant yelling - cheering, singing or whistling
- depending upon the moment. It's impossible to hear the announcer and
a wonder that the players can hear the signals from the referees. This
year's event even had an appearance by Elvis. Elvis Fatovic that is.
And it's hard to imagine Elvis Presley getting more cheers than his
Croatian namesake when he scored the game's first goal at the
two-minute mark... </p>

      <p>The first known traces of
tennis playing in Croatia date from 1878 (in Zagreb and Samobor). The
first Davis Cup match in Croatia was played in Zagreb in 1927. In the
finals of the 1939 Davis Cup match for the European zone, held in
Zagreb, the Croatian team defeated the representation of Germany. The
players who brought this victory were Franjo Puncec and Dragutin Mitic.
This was probably the gratest international success of Croatian sport
in the first half of the 20th century. Besides the USA and Australia,
by the end of 1930s Croatia had the strongest Davis Cup team in the
world. See <em>Povijest tenisa u
Hrvatskoj</em>, [<a

      <p><strong><a name="mitic"></a>Dragutin
Mitic</strong> (1917) was a
distinguished Croatian tennis player. In 1938 Simone Mathieu (France)
and Mitic became the <font color="#ff0000">Roland
Garros</font> <font color="#ff0000">mixed double champions</font>.
In 1939, playing with Franjo Puncec, he defeated the German Davis Cup
team at the European zone finals in Zagreb. From 1954 until 1965 he
worked as a tennis professional in Bogota, capital of Columbia. It is
interesting that his photo appears on a Colombia stamp, see below. In
1965 he immigrated to the USA.</p>

is the only country in the world with no mountain above 2,000
meters (though with probably the most beautiful mountain in Europe -
VELEBIT) and with world's top skier - <a
 href="http://www.janica.croski.hr" target="_blank">Janica
Kostelic</a>. She was shining in
women's slalom in 1999 (being only 17 years old). Her second victory of
the season put her in first place in the World Cup overall standings
and strengthened her lead in the specialty standings. In her historical
victory in Serre Chevalier, France, 5. December 1999, the difference
between the first two was 1.78 seconds, the greatest achieved in the
previous 20 years! Her ardent supporter is Goran Ivanisevic. In March
2001 Janica became the <font color="#ff0000">World
Cup Champion</font> in alpine
skiing. This is one of greatest successes in the history of Croatian
sport. Upon her arrival to the Zagreb airport she obtained 1256 roses
and custard slices... </p>

      <p>In 2002, at the Winter
Olympic Games held in Salt Lake City in the USA, Janica Kostelic became
the first Alpine skier to win as many as <font color="#ff0000">four
Olympic medals</font>
at a single Game: <font color="#ff0000">three
gold medals</font> and one silver.
This was a result of many years of painstaking work undertaken already
at her tender age by her father Mr. Ante Kostelic and the whole family.
As stated by Mr. Kostelic, this success would not have been possible
without free Croatia. </p>

fastest in the second run to win in 1 minute, 38.81 seconds. It was the
latest starting position for a slalom winner in World Cup history and
third latest in any event. In December 2008 he secured his <a

      <blockquote> <i>The
life of the family of Kostelic is unique in the history of skiing sport
(and may be in the history of sport in general). When Janica and Ivica
were very young, they used to travel with their old Lada (Russian car),
and also to sleep and eat in the car. At the same time other children
stayed in a hotel, sleeping in their warm beds. Kostelic's were
sleeping also in a small mountain tent, sometimes at the temperature
reaching -20 degrees Celsius. They were not able to pay for their
trainings, so they used to wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning, to wash
their faces with snow, and train at dawn (free of charge) with their
worn up gloves, while others were still sleeping or having breakfast.</i>

        </p>
        <p> <i>It
is well known that skiing is the sport of the rich. When Kostelic's
went back home from Austria, Germany, France or Switzerland, several
times it happened to them that they had to sell their skies in order to
be able to buy petrol for their Lada... And let us not forget, at that
time the <a href="et112.html">Greater
Serbian aggression</a> was raging
throughout Croatia and <a href="et02.html">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a>
(1990-1995). Mr. <a href="#gips">Ante
Kostelic-Gips</a> himself, father of
Ivica and Janica, is an amazing Croatian sportsman and trainer, former
handball player, working with his children on the long run. He
remembers with deep gratitude an Austrian, Mr Willie Arnsteiner,
wire-keeper, who donated them 100 Schillings daily during a critical
period, and who predicted their great skiing future.
        <p></p>
At the age of 15 Janica had <b>22
consecutive wins</b> at European
competitions for children during one season. One day after the death of
president Franjo Tudjman, Janica was skiing with mourning black
armband. Young Kostelic's were raised in deep patriotism, and their
sacrifices will always be remembered. Let us also mention a regular
short ritual of Christian crossing immediately before every
competition. It is amusing to see how "objective" European TV media
strive to avoid this indicative and important detail.</i>

on the knee out of five were broken. After a very difficult operation
and reconstruction of her knee, she had a painstaking program of
getting back to normal living. She was able not only to walk again, but
also to win on European, World, and Olympic competitions in skiing. </i></p>
        <p><i>The
human story of Kostelic's is waiting to be written in
all details,
with a special emphasis on low blows of "independent" media. This story
is much greater than the story about their sport successes. Ivica and
Janica, like many others on this web page, would never have appeared

            <p>One personal best
which stands out in my memory, resulted in a gold medal for <strong>Dean
Lukin</strong> in the Los Angles
Games 1984. <strong>Dean Lukin</strong>,
from Port Lincoln, South Australia, was an amateur in Olympic weight
lifting. He was the son of a fisherman who worked for his dad. He built
massive legs and arms hauling in huge blue fin tuna from the southern
ocean. He was 24, already a millionaire, owning a white Mercedes and
two light planes. He won gold in the super-heavyweight division in the
Commonwealth Games and the national titles. He trained only in the 16
weeks prior to the Olympics because work came first. The super
heavyweight lifters from Russia, the Eastern block countries and
America trained full-time, held all the records, and had won every
previous Olympic gold medal. At Los Angles <strong>Dean
Lukin</strong> was to lift his
personal best.</p>

            <p>After the first
round he trailed in third place behind the American Mario Martinez who
was the favourite and Manfred Nerlinger from West Germany.<strong>
Dean Lukin</strong>, after the
snatch was 15 kilos behind Mario allowing for the personal weight
difference. In the final clean and jerk Mario lifted 220 kilograms, his
personal best. But <strong>Lukin</strong>
with a great effort lifted 222 kilograms. </p>
            <p>The West German
tried for his personal best but fell flat on his back. Then <strong>Lukin</strong>
lifted 227.5 kilos, his personal best. <strong>Lukin</strong>
was now guaranteed at least a silver medal. Mario then lifted another
personal best of 225 kilos. 10,000 American spectators roared, certain
their man had won the gold medal. Mario Martinez came back on stage for
three encores. <strong>Lukin</strong>
was, on the combined weights 12.5 kilos behind, and he had just lifted
his personal best for the second time.</p>
            <p>The speakers
announced "<strong>Dean Lukin</strong>
will pass other lifts and go for gold. He has ordered the bar to be
loaded to 240 kilos." The crowd was stunned. As he walked on stage, <strong>Lukin</strong>
was attempting 12.5 kilos more than he had ever lifted before. With the
cleanest of clean and jerks he heaved the bar above his head, holding
aloft the equivalent of two large refrigerators! The judges signalled a
clean lift. He had won. The crowd went delirious. I jumped high into
the air! That night the Russians took him out to dinner, treating him
like a hero because he had defeated the Americans. He had done his
best. ...</p>
            <p>The point of
personal best, is not an individual achievement. <strong>Dean
Lukin</strong> had his coach by his
side focusing his energies. His mother was in the dressing room urging
him on in a way that made him determined. A personal best is a quality
that is achieved by human effort plus the help and support of others.

are very popular in various parts of Croatia, especially in the north
(in Slavonia). The <a

existed already in 1506, and is <font color="#ff0000">among the oldest
in Europe</font>.
It was visited by <a href="filip.html">Queen

      <p>The town of Djakovo was
occupied by the Turks in the period of 1536-1667, and the stud was
renewed in 1706. In 1806 it was moved to the nearby Ivandvor, where it
is also today. </p>
      <p>Also very famous were the
      <a href="lipizz.html">Lipik
Lipizzaners</a>, which was the
largest stud in Croatia until the Greater Serbian 1991-1995 aggression
on Croatia. </p>

      <p>The first mention of <a
 href="http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ah_u_Hrvatskoj"
 target="_blank">playing chess in Croatia</a>
dates from 14th century, more precisely, from <strong>1385</strong>
in the city of Zadar. Thomas Hyde, an English orientalist from 17th
century, travelled through Croatia, and mentioned that the <em>correspondence
chess</em> had been played between
Croatian and Venetian merchants in <strong><font color="#ff0000">1650</font></strong>,
more precisely, beween the <a href="et111.html">Dubrovnik</a>
and Venetian merchants. It is <font color="#ff0000"><strong>the
oldest mention of the correspondence chess in history</strong></font>.
This fact can be found in his book "De ludis orientalibus" (On Eastern
Games), published in Latin in 1694. </p>
      <p><font size="-1">In Croatia there are 162 registered players
of correspondence chess (30 of them active). Until the advent of
computers, chess moves were sent by snail mail, and sometimes one had
to wait for a few months for a single move. It is not surprising that
such a game could last for several years. Since 1990s the speed of the
correspondence chess has been revolutionarized due to the possibilities
of electronic communication, and its duration is comparable to that of
the "usual" chess game. Information by the courtesy of dr. Zvonko
Krecak, Croatian physicist, who is the president of the <em>Croatian
Correspondence Chess Association </em>
(Hrvatska udruga dopisnog saha) since 1987 (continuously till 2010 when
these lines are written). </font> </p>

grandmaster, earned the International Master title by winning the 1981 <font

 target="_blank">Chess Street</a>,

Aleksandar Lysenko, Russian international chess master, is the author
of an article "In the Chess Street" published by the well known Russian
chess journal "64 Chess Survey", Moscow 1996. The article deals with
the Chess Club in the Chess Street in the town of Ravna Gora in
Croatia. He wrote: "It is good that such a street exists, but it is a
pity that the street is not in Russia." </p>
