<p><font size="4" face="Gill Sans">Alan made his national sports
desk debut with <strong>THE DAY TODAY</strong>, having previously
worked for regional television and radio in Norwich.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Gill Sans">A seasoned professional, Alan
has a wide knowledge of all sports (as when he went to Marple for
the horse racing and asked the jockeys if they were allowed out
from school to ride the horses). Most impressive was Alan's World
Cup Soccer Meter which was so successful that it was not used
again this year.</font></p>

to take one of his most daring reports, riding in a car with a
woman!</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Gill Sans">After his success on <strong>THE
DAY TODAY</strong>, Alan went on to front his own chat show -
first on the radio and then for a highly publicised television
series - Highly publicised due to the fact that in his last show
he shot and killed one of his guests! Since that event, Alan has
been working the popular 4.30 - 7.00am shift on Radio Norwich
although he hopes to get back into television very soon now...</font></p>
