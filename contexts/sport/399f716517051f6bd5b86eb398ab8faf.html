Jim had a huge impact on the development of Futsal, both in Australia and internationally. He played a key role in bringing Futsal to Australia from Brazil in 1986 and worked tirelessly to develop the sport within FIFA. He travelled extensively for 15 years on this mission, as a national coach, FIFA instructor, and senior administrator. <br /><br />In 1987 Jim and Charles Perkins AO devised the first Aboriginal Futsal Cup with Canada and Jim coached the first Australian Aboriginal Futsal Team. He developed and implemented five nationally televised national leagues for Futsal between 1988 and 1995 and was an official delegate to the first FIFA Congress on Futsal in Guatemala in 2000.<br /><br />Jim designed and implemented a successful international Futsal training program for athletes,<br />coaches and officials, utilising international exchange programs (especially to Brazil), a key purpose of which was skills development for traditional football. He developed Futsal?s coaching accreditation courses which are used internationally. <br /><br />He also negotiated the partnership between the ACT Government and the Brazilian Olympic Committee for Brazilian pre-Olympic Games training in Canberra and was a member of the 2000 Olympic Games Football Taskforce. <br /><br />Jim is also indefatigable in his pursuit of the recognition of governments and the broader community of the benefits that participation in all sports bring to the community. To this end he devoted 17 years of service as President of ACT Sports House, which under his Presidency became ACTSport, the peak industry body for sport in the ACT.

<p class="bodytext">The NSW&nbsp; team then played against the Queensland state team and from there the Australian Wallaby side was selected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter achieved full selection despite residing in the ACT and regions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ACTRU at that stage did not have full state status hence Peter had to compete against the whole of NSW in the initial selection process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="bodytext">Peter captained the Queensland Tour in 1966 and his overall career saw him play in 150+games for the Queanbeyan Whites, 40 ACTRU representative games, 12 NSW County and 14 NSW Waratahs games.&nbsp; Peter played 27 games for the Wallabies including 2 overseas tours to South Africa in 1963 and Tour of the British Isles, France and Canada in 1966/67, 4 full internationals 3 home and one overseas test where he scored 9 points on debut in the famous 18-9 victory at Sydney in 1963, the first home test win in 29 years for Australia.&nbsp; Peter was the top point scorer in the 1963 tour of South Africa scoring 79 points in 14&nbsp; games. For his performance in the opening match of the tour Peter was awarded the ?The Springfield Tyre Co? award.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Peter had a distinguished playing career and unselfishly contributed to his sport, representing Rugby at the highes level at great personal expense to himself, returning from the 1966 Tour of the British Isles ?Penniless broke? yet unswerving in his dedication to the sport that he so dearly loved.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Peter has been a role model for players and officials alike in ACT Rugby and still commands respect not only from his famous international peers in the game but all in the sport and the community who know him.

Si?n commenced cycling in Gilgandra, NSW in 1971 and was the only female in a club of 30 members. Si?n competed in country areas with considerable success in an era where championships were not conducted for females, as they were not permitted to compete in State and National Championships and became the first woman to represent Australia in the World Track Cycling Championships.

He was particularly skilful in billiards, winning 19 ACT State billiards championships. Before World War II, Bill was showing great potential, modelling his style on the smooth cueing technique of Canberra sporting identity Jack Edlington, and made his first century billiards break in 1939.</p>
<p align="justify" class="bodytext">After coming back from the war he resumed playing again and won his first ACT State billiards title in 1948. In those early post war years Bill was invincible in billiards and won all his matches playing in the weekly inner-club competition for Transport, where he was employed as a Commonwealth car driver. Bill made innumerable century breaks in billiards and two breaks of more than 200, the first being 203 in a Canberra competition match against the highly rated Arthur Allen. He later improved on that effort with a break of 205.</p>
<p align="justify" class="bodytext">Beadman's efforts with billiards were matched by his efforts in snooker, winning 14 ACT State snooker titles, giving him a combined total of 33 ACT State billiards and snooker Championships. On occasions Bill was beaten in snooker, whereas this did not happen in billiards, especially in the early post war years. Bill played snooker exhibitions against Australian champions Horace Lindrum and Eddie Charlton. He did so well against Charlton that he considered turning professional with Charlton. However at that time snooker professionals were earning only modest salaries and Beadman decided to stay with his more secure job as a Commonwealth car driver.</p>

He has also coached the ACT Open Women's at the National Championships several times and come away with outstanding results. <br /><br />His coaching achievements at the International level are also to be rivaled with. In 2001, in his first year as Australian Open Men's Team coach, the team defeated the New Zealand World Champion Team for the first time ever. In 2004, the team took third place at the World Championships, which is their best result ever.

He first represented the ACT in 1986, and continued his representation until his retirement in 1996, playing over 100 games in ACT colours. <br /><br />His international career began in 1988, spanning eight years. Laing represented Australia in 40 international games, and also played for Canada in the World Youth Championships in 1989 because Australia did not field a team. Laing's excellent understanding of the game and natural talent were acknowledged by being selected as the captain for the Australian Men's team for the 1996 World Open Men's Championships, his last championships. <br /><br />A powerful and reliable batter, and a respected team captain at all levels of play, Laing was rewarded with induction into the Softball Australia Hall of Fame in 2001. This recognition was perhaps surpassed when Laing received the very prestigious honour of being the first Australian male to be admitted into the International Softball Hall of Fame in 2003. <br /><br />Having such skill and knowledge of softball, it was only natural for Laing to begin coaching upon his retired from elite competition in 1996.

Both teams were undefeated in their campaigns for the world title, demonstrating Laing's capability to both play and coach at an extremely high level. <br /><br />Laing has not only restricted himself to excelling in the sport of softball, having a long and successful career in ice hockey as well. Laing played for the Canberra Knights in the Australian Ice Hockey League from 1987 to 2000, represented the ACT at the Goodall Men's National Championships for a decade, and played in the ACT U21 team at the National Championships.

He won Eastlake's best and fairest award in 1945. In 1946 he was captain of the Eastlake team that lost only one match that season - the Grand Final.

He was selected for Group 8, Country, New South Wales and finally in the Australian team which toured England in 1948-49. Hawke left Canberra in August, 1948, buoyed by a gift of just over 10 pound from the Canberra Rugby League. It was sorely needed. Hawke exhausted all his leave entitlements in order to play for Group 8 and then Country. When he applied for additional leave to play for New South Wales against Queensland in Brisbane, virtually the selection trial for the Kangaroos, his application was refused. Nevertheless, he went to Brisbane and was selected in the Kangaroo squad party, but when he returned to work at the Printing Office he was dismissed for being absent without leave.</font></p>

Ken represented NSW between 1970 and 1984. He represented the ACT from 1985 to 1993, and Australia between 1987 and 1990, which included the Commonwealth Games in Auckland. He was an Australian Squad member from 1986 to 1992, and has been an Australian selector from 1994-1997. Ken played 87 State games for the ACT. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Some of Ken?s major career highlights include his participation in the Australian Fours, the Countrywide Trans-Tasman Master singles in New Zealand, and the Arafura Open Singles and Fours. From 1970 until 1993, Ken had 45 victories in the Club and District Singles, Pairs, Triples and Fours. Ken?s ability to play bowls is super-seeded only by his level of sportsmanship and the esteem in which fellow players hold him. </p></div></div></div><div class="csc-textpic-clear"><!-- --></div></div><div id="c179" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n99"><h1>Tony Wynd - AFL </h1></div><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-intext-left"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap csc-textpic-single-image"><img src="uploads/pics/Tony_Wynd.jpg" width="250" height="375" border="0" alt="Tony wynd" /></div><div class="csc-textpic-text"><p align="justify" class="bodytext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Known as one of the greatest AFL talents from the ACT, Tony Wynd endured a remarkable career with the local Queanbeyan Tigers club. This included playing in 11 First Grade Grand Finals, winning six Premierships, as well as captaining his beloved Tigers for several seasons. As a reflection on his ability and consistency as a player, Tony was also chosen to be part of 41 ACT Representative fixture matches.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="bodytext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Injury prevented Tony from playing in the All-Australian Representative team which toured Ireland and the United States in 1987. His selection was widely recognised as he was one of very few players from outside the major Australian Football League teams to ever be named in an All-Australian team. Notable achievements include being named Best and Fairest player on five separate occasions for the Queanbeyan Tigers First Grade squad, an award which has since been named the Tony Wynd Medal. Tony also received the Mulrooney Medal for best and fairest in the ACT competition on four occasions, a record for the ACT Australian Football League (ACTAFL) and an acknowledgment of his exceptional sporting ability. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="bodytext"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tony was also named Vice-Captain of the ACTAFL Legends team, a team selected from those who have played in the ACTAFL's 75-year history, a tribute to the rare talent which he possessed. Upon retirement Tony became Assistant Coach of the Queanbeyan Tigers from 1988 to 1993 and was awarded Life Membership to the club. Fittingly, Tony received the Australian Sports Medal in 2000 in recognition of his contribution to sport. His induction into the ActewAGL ACT Sport Hall of Fame 4 years later is tribute to his significance in ACT sporting history.</font></p></div></div><div class="csc-textpic-clear"><!-- --></div></div><div id="c180" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n100"><h1>June Yandell - Bowls </h1></div><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-intext-left"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap csc-textpic-single-image"><img src="uploads/pics/JUNE_YENDELL.jpg" width="250" height="372" border="0" alt="June Yandell" /></div><div class="csc-textpic-text"><p align="justify" class="bodytext"><font face="Verdana" color="#000000">Regarded as one of Canberra's best female bowlers of her era, June Yandell reached the pinnacle of her career when selected as a reserve for the Australian World Bowls Team in 1986.
