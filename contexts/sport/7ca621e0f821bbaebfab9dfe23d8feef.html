Sports are used as entertainment for the player and the viewer. It has also been proven by experiments that daily exercise increases mental strength and power to study.

Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference">[2]</sup> Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional <a href="Iran.htm"title="Iran">Iranian</a> martial art of Zourkhaneh had a close connection to the warfare skills.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference">[3]</sup> Among other sports that originate in <a href="Iran.htm"title="Iran">Persia</a> are polo and jousting.</p> <p>A wide range of sports were already established by the time of <a href="Ancient_Greece.htm"title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference">[4]</sup></p> <p>Sports have been increasingly organized and regulated from the time of the Ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialization has brought increased leisure time to the citizens of developed and developing countries, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet--all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.</p> <p>In the new millennium, new sports have been going further from the physical aspect to the mental or psychological aspect of competing. Cyber sports organizations are becoming more and more popular.</p> <p>Activities where the outcome is determined by judgement over execution are considered performances, or competition.</p> <p></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[edit]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sportsmanship</span></h2> <dl> <dd> <div class="noprint"><i>Main article: Sportsmanship</i></div> </dd> <dd><span class="boilerplate seealso"><i>See also: Gamesmanship&#160;and Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing</i></span></dd> </dl> <p><b>Sportsmanship</b> is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in losing.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference">[5]</sup></p> <p>Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice, that it's “not that you won or lost but how you played the game," and the Modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin: "The most important thing . . . is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.</p> <p>But often the pressures of competition or an obsession with individual achievement—as well as the intrusion of technology—can all work against enjoyment and fair play by participants.</p> <p>People responsible for leisure activities often seek recognition and respectability as sports by joining sports federations such as 5 IOC, or by forming their own regulatory body. In this way sports evolve from leisure activity to more formal sports: relatively recent newcomers are BMX cycling, snowboarding, and wrestling. Some of these activities have been popular but uncodified pursuits in various forms for different lengths of time. Indeed, the formal regulation of sport is a relatively modern and increasing development.</p> <p>Sportsmanship, within any given game, is how each competitor acts before, during, and after the competition. Not only is it important to have good sportsmanship if one wins, but also if one loses. For example, in football it is considered sportsmanlike to kick the ball out of play to allow treatment for an injured player on the other side. Reciprocally, the other team is expected to return the ball from the throw-in.</p> <p>Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. Rioting or hooliganism are common and ongoing problems at national and international sporting contests, particularly football matches</p> <p></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[edit]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professionalism</span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify" style="float:right"></div> Modern sports have complex rules and highly organized.</div> </div> </div> <dl> <dd> <div class="noprint"><i>Main article: Professional sport</i></div> </dd> </dl> <p>The entertainment aspect of sports, together with the spread of mass media and increased leisure time, has led to professionalism in sports. This has resulted in some conflict, where the paycheck can be seen as more important than recreational aspects, or where the sports are changed simply to make them more profitable and popular, thereby losing certain valued traditions.</p> <p>The entertainment aspect also means that sportsmen and women are often elevated to celebrity status.</p> <p></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[edit]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2> <p>At times, sports and politics can have a large amount of influence on each other.</p> <p>When <a href="Apartheid.htm"title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> was the official policy in <a href="South_Africa.htm"title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, many sports people, particularly in rugby union, adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference">[6]</sup></p> <p>The 1936 Summer Olympics held in <a href="Berlin.htm"title="Berlin">Berlin</a> was an illustration, perhaps best recognised in retrospect, where an ideology was developing which used the event to strengthen its spread through propaganda.</p> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify" style="float:right"></div> In modern sport had appeared the motorization.</div> </div> </div> <p>In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism. Until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sports administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) if she/he played or supported soccer, or other games seen to be of British origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of soccer and rugby union at Gaelic venues. This ban is still enforced, but has been modified to allow football and rugby be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road is being redeveloped. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.</p> <p>Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sports, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue (see Football War). These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.</p> <p></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[edit]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Physical art</span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify" style="float:right"></div> Gymnastics</div> </div> </div> <p>Sports have many affinities with art. Ice skating and Tai chi, and Dancesport for example, are sports that come close to artistic spectacles in themselves. Similarly, there are other activities that have elements of sport and art in their execution, such as artistic gymnastics, Bodybuilding, Parkour, performance art, Yoga, bossaball, dressage, culinary arts, etc. Perhaps the best example is Bull-fighting, which in Spain is reported in the arts pages of newspapers. The fact that art is so close to sports in some situations is probably related to the nature of sports. The definition of "sports" above put forward the idea of an activity pursued not just for the usual purposes, for example, running not simply to get places, but running for its own sake, running as well as we can.</p> <p>This is similar to a common view of aesthetic value, which is seen as something over and above the strictly functional value coming from an object's normal use. So an aesthetically pleasing car is one which doesn't just get from A to B, but which impresses us with its grace, poise, and charisma.</p> <p>In the same way, a sporting performance such as jumping doesn't just impress us as being an effective way to avoid obstacles or to get across streams. It impresses us because of the ability, skill, and style which is shown.</p> <p>Art and sports were probably more clearly linked at the time of Ancient Greece, when gymnastics and calisthenics invoked admiration and aesthetic appreciation for the physical build, prowess and 'arete' displayed by participants. The modern term 'art' as skill, is related to this ancient Greek term 'arete'. The closeness of art and sport in these times was revealed by the nature of the Olympic Games which, as we have seen, were celebrations of both sporting and artistic achievements, poetry, sculpture and architecture.</p> <p></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[edit]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify" style="float:right"></div> Golf, a kind of sport where the moving has much lesser part than dexterity has.</div> </div> </div> <p>Technology has an important role in sports, whether applied to an athlete's health, the athlete's technique, or equipment's characteristics.</p> <p><b>Equipment</b> As sports have grown more competitive, the need for better equipment has arose. Golf clubs, football helmets, baseball bats, soccer balls, hockey skates, and other equipment have all seen considerable changes when new technologies have been applied.</p> <p><b>Health</b> Ranging from nutrition to the treatment of injuries, as the knowledge of the human body has deepened over time, an athlete's potential has been increased. Athletes are now able to play to an older age, recover more quickly from injuries, and train more effectively than previous generations of athletes.</p> <p><b>Instruction</b> Advancing technology created new opportunities for research into sports. It is now possible to analyse aspects of sports that were previously out of the reach of comprehension. Being able to use motion capture to capture an athlete's movement, or advanced computer simulations to model physical scenarios has greatly increased an athlete's ability to understand what they are doing and how they can improve themselves.</p> <p></p> <h2><span class="editsection">[edit]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terminology</span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"> <div class="thumbcaption"> <div class="magnify" style="float:right"></div> Show Jumping, an equestrian sport.</div> </div> </div> <p>In British English, sporting activities are commonly denoted by the collective noun "sport". In American English, "sports" is more used. In all English dialects, "sports" is the term used for more than one specific sport. For example, "football and <a href="Swimming.htm"title="Swimming">swimming</a> are my favourite sports", would sound natural to all English speakers, whereas "I enjoy sport" would sound less natural than "I enjoy sports" to North Americans.</p> <p>The term "sport" is sometimes extended to encompass all competitive activities, regardless of the level of physical activity. Both games of skill and motor sports exhibit many of the characteristics of physical sports, such as skill, sportsmanship, and at the highest levels, even professional sponsorship associated with physical sports.
