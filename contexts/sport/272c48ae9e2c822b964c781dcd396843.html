                            <p> It has long been established by the Commission and the  Community Courts that <strong>economic  activities</strong> in the context of sport do fall within the scope of EC law,  including Articles 81 and 82 EC and internal market freedoms. This was recently  confirmed by the Community Courts in rulings by the Court of First Instance  (CFI) and the ECJ in the <em>Meca Medina</em> case.<a href="#_notes" title="[2]">[2]</a> Although sport fulfils very important educational, public health, social,  cultural and recreational functions that must obviously be preserved, there  exists a wide ranging field of activities in sport that clearly constitute  economic activities. Examples include the sale of tickets for sport events,  advertising activities, the sale of media rights for sport events and the  transfer of athletes in return for transfer fees.</p>
                            <p> Already in the 1970&rsquo;s, the ECJ ruled in <em>Walrave</em><a href="#_notes" title="[3]">[3]</a>  and <em>Don&agrave;</em><a href="#_notes" title="[4]">[4]</a>  that sport itself was subject to Community law where it constituted an economic  activity. This has been confirmed by the Community Courts on several occasions  later on, in particular in the <em>Bosman</em><a href="#_notes" title="[5]">[5]</a>  ruling which played a significant role in guiding the Commission in its  development of competition policy in the sport sector. The <em>Bosman</em> ruling confirmed that sport is subject to all relevant EC  Treaty provisions as regards the economic activities it generates, and that  those provisions are to be applied on the basis of general principles taking  into account certain special characteristics of the sector. These sport rulings  by the Community Courts were based on the Treaty provisions concerning the  internal market, and notably those relating to the free movements of workers.  In view of today&rsquo;s commercialisation of professional sport, it cannot be  disputed that professional sport constitutes an economic activity as has  recently been confirmed by the CFI which stated that &ldquo;high level sport has  become, to a great extent, an economic activity&rdquo;.<a href="#_notes" title="[6]">[6]</a>  Nevertheless, as will be shown below, the fact that professional sport has  become &ldquo;big business&rdquo; does not exclude that anti-competitive sporting rules  which are inherent in the organisation and proper conduct of sport and  proportionate do not infringe Articles 81(1) or 82 EC or that restrictions  resulting there from may be justified under Articles 81(3) and 82 EC.</p>
                            <p> The following sections of this document will deal with two  separate but interrelated aspects of sport, namely (i) the regulatory  (organisational) aspects of sport and (ii) certain revenue generating  activities related to sport, in particular the sale and purchase of sports  media rights and ticketing arrangements. The Annex contains a list of  the relevant judgments and decisions concerning the sport sector that are  referred to in the document.</p>
                            <p> The focus of this document is the application of the EC  anti-trust rules, i.e. Articles 81 and 82 EC to undertakings. State Aids and EC  Merger Regulation rules as well as restrictions resulting from Member State  legislation and other State measures remain outside the scope of this document.</p>

                            <p> The recent ECJ <em>Meca  Medina</em> judgment is the first judgment in which the Community Courts applied  Articles 81 and 82 EC to a sporting rule adopted by a sports association  relating to a sporting activity (swimming).<a href="#_notes" title="[7]">[7]</a>  The Commission had already applied Articles 81 and 82 EC in individual cases  concerning sporting activities, and the ECJ&rsquo;s ruling broadly confirmed the  Commission&rsquo;s approach adopted in these cases. Sport cases previously decided by  the Community Courts had concerned the application of the EC Treaty provisions  on the economic freedoms, such as free movement of persons or services. The  ECJ&rsquo;s judgment in <em>Meca Medina</em> provides valuable guidance as regards the methodological approach towards  assessing a sporting rule under Articles 81 and 82 EC. </p>
                            <p> The case concerned a complaint by two professional long  distance swimmers who challenged the compatibility with Articles 81 and 82 EC  of the anti-doping rules adopted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)  and implemented by the swimming governing body F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de  Natation Amateur (FINA). Both the CFI and the ECJ reiterated that sport is subject  to Community law only insofar as sport constitutes an economic activity. Both  Courts found no violation of Article 81 or 82 EC, thus confirming the decision  of the Commission. </p>
                            <p> Unlike the CFI, the ECJ explicitly held that the  qualification of a rule as &ldquo;purely sporting&rdquo; was not sufficient to remove the  athlete or the sports association adopting the rule in question from the scope  of Articles 81 and 82 EC.<a href="#_notes" title="[8]">[8]</a>  Having rejected the relevance of the simple reference to "purely sporting  rules", the ECJ went on to describe the methodological approach that has  to be applied to decide whether a given conduct falls within Articles 81 and/or  82. </p>
                            <p> It first found that the specific requirements of Articles 81  and 82 EC must be examined irrespective of the nature of the rule, in  particular it must be determined &ldquo;whether the rules which govern that [sport]  activity emanate from an undertaking, whether the latter restricts competition  or abuses its dominant position, and whether that restriction or that abuse  affects trade between Member States.&rdquo;<a href="#_notes" title="[9]">[9]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> The ECJ concluded, however, that the anti-doping rules in  question did not infringe Article 81(1) EC despite the fact that the penalties  under the anti-doping rules were capable of producing restrictive effects on  competition as they could lead to the exclusion of athletes from sport events.  The ECJ reached this conclusion on the basis of the principles set up in the <em>Wouters</em> judgment.<a href="#_notes" title="[10]">[10]</a>  In this respect, the ECJ reiterated that account must be taken of (i) the <strong>overall context</strong> in which the rules were  taken or produce their effects and of their <strong>objectives </strong>and (ii) whether the restrictive effects are <strong>inherent</strong> in the pursuit of the  objectives and (iii) are <strong>proportionate</strong> to them. The ECJ found that the objective of the anti-doping rules was to  ensure fair sport competitions with equal chances for all athletes as well as  the protection of athletes&rsquo; health, the integrity and objectivity of  competitive sport and ethical values in sport. The limitations of action  imposed on the athletes by the anti-doping rules were considered by the ECJ to  be &ldquo;inherent in the organisation and proper conduct of competitive sport&rdquo;.<a href="#_notes" title="[11]">[11]</a>  The ECJ also examined whether the rules were limited to what is necessary as  regards (i) the threshold for the banned substance in question and (ii) the  severity of the penalties (in respect of which the ECJ also noted that the  athletes had not argued that the penalties imposed were excessive). The ECJ  found that the rules were proportionate in both cases. The appeal was therefore  rejected.</p>

                            <p> Article 81 EC applies to &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; and &ldquo;associations of  undertakings&rdquo;, while Article 82 EC applies to &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;. The ECJ has  defined the term &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; broadly to include &ldquo;every entity engaged in an  economic activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in  which it is financed.&rdquo;<a href="#_notes" title="[12]">[12]</a>  Economic activity is any activity consisting of &ldquo;offering goods or services on  the market&rdquo;.<a href="#_notes" title="[13]">[13]</a>  Economic  activity may take place at various levels in the sport sector, including by  individual athletes, sport clubs and sports associations. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Individual athletes</strong>.  The ECJ found that a high-level judoka participating in an international  competition was exercising an economic activity - even if she was not  remunerated by the organiser - due to the fact that such services are normally  remunerated and that the participation in the event generates economic activity  (e.g., the sale of tickets, transmission by broadcasters, sponsoring  agreements).<a href="#_notes" title="[14]">[14]</a>  In the same  judgment, the ECJ also stated that the amateur status of athletes does not  necessarily remove them from the scope of economic activities.<a href="#_notes" title="[15]">[15]</a>  While independent athletes thus constitute undertakings, Advocate General Lenz  considered that football players employed by a football club do not constitute  undertakings.<a href="#_notes" title="[16]">[16]</a>  However,  even if athletes are employed by a sport club, they may be considered  undertakings insofar as they carry out economic activities independent thereof,  e.g., by entering into sponsoring agreements. </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Sport clubs/teams</strong>.  It is settled case law that sport clubs/teams are undertakings within the  meaning of Article 81 and 82 EC to the extent they carry out economic  activities.<a href="#_notes" title="[17]">[17]</a>  Sport  clubs/teams carry out economic activity, e.g., by selling tickets to the sport  events, selling broadcasting rights or concluding sponsoring or advertising  agreements. </p>

                                <strong>National sports  associations</strong> may be both undertakings under Articles 81 and 82 EC and  associations of undertakings under Article 81 EC. Sports associations are  undertakings where they themselves carry out economic activity, e.g., by  commercially exploiting a sport event.<a href="#_notes" title="[18]">[18]</a>  Sports associations are associations of undertakings under Article 81 EC to the  extent they constitute groupings of sport clubs/teams or athletes for which the  practice of sport constitutes an economic activity.<a href="#_notes" title="[19]">[19]</a>  The CFI also held that the fact that a national association gathers both  amateur and professional clubs/teams is of no importance as far as the  classification as an association of undertakings is concerned.<a href="#_notes" title="[20]">[20]</a>  Article 82 EC does not include the concept of &ldquo;association of undertakings.&rdquo;  However, the CFI has found that even where a sports association is not itself  active on a given market, it may be considered an undertaking under Article 82  EC to the extent the association is the emanation of its members which are  active on the market.<a href="#_notes" title="[21]">[21]</a>

Sporting rules adopted by national or international  sports associations may constitute agreements or decisions by undertakings or  associations of undertakings within the meaning of <strong>Article 81(1) EC</strong>.<a href="#_notes" title="[27]">[27]</a>  Such sporting rules, like any other decisions or agreements, are prohibited if  they have as their object or effect the restriction or distortion of  competition within the common market and affect trade between Member States.<a href="#_notes" title="[28]">[28]</a>

For the purposes of applying this provision, the  relevant market must be determined. As mentioned earlier, sports associations  usually have practical monopolies in a given sport and may thus normally be  considered dominant in the market of the organisation of sport events under  Article 82 EC. Even where a sporting association is not active on a given  market, it may be considered to hold a dominant position if it operates on that  market through its members (e.g., sport clubs/teams).<a href="#_notes" title="[29]">[29]</a>  Sport clubs/teams (and athletes) may also hold a collective dominant position  under Article 82 EC to the extent that they present themselves as a &ldquo;collective  entity vis &agrave; vis their competitors, their trading partners and consumers&rdquo; as a  result of the implementation of rules adopted by a national or international  sports association.<a href="#_notes" title="[30]">[30]</a>

                            <p> The ECJ has explicitly acknowledged in <em>Meca Medina</em> that even in cases where a sporting rule restricts the  freedom of action of the athletes it may not breach Articles 81 and 82 EC to  the extent the rule in question pursues a legitimate objective and its  restrictive effects are inherent in the pursuit of that objective and are  proportionate to it.<a href="#_notes" title="[31]">[31]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Legitimate objectives</strong> of sporting rules will normally relate to the &ldquo;organisation and proper conduct  of competitive sport&rdquo;<a href="#_notes" title="[32]">[32]</a>  and may include, e.g., the ensuring of fair sport competitions with equal  chances for all athletes, the ensuring of uncertainty of results, the  protection of the athletes&rsquo; health, the protection of the safety of spectators,  the encouragement of training of young athletes, the ensuring of financial  stability of sport clubs/teams or the ensuring of a uniform and consistent  exercise of a given sport (the &ldquo;rules of the game&rdquo;). The specificity of sport,  i.e. the distinctive features setting sport apart from other economic  activities, such as the interdependence between competing adversaries, will be  taken into consideration when assessing the existence of a legitimate  objective.</p>
                            <p> The restrictions caused by a sporting rule must be <strong>inherent</strong> in the pursuit of its  objective. The ECJ found, e.g., that the penalties contained in the anti-doping  rules in <em>Meca Medina</em> were inherent  for the proper conduct of competitive sport and the healthy rivalry of  athletes. Likewise, the prohibition on the ownership of two or several sport  clubs/teams competing against each other was found by the Commission to be  inherent for ensuring the uncertainty of results. Rules inherent in the  organisation and proper conduct of competitive sport also include the &ldquo;rules of  the game&rdquo;, i.e., rules which determine the number of players, their function,  duration of the competition/game etc. Obvious examples of rules of the game  include the rule that a football team must have eleven players or a rule that  regulates the dimensions of the goals.<a href="#_notes" title="[33]">[33]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> The sporting rule must also be <strong>proportionate</strong> in relation to its objective in order for it not to  infringe Articles 81(1) and 82 EC and must be applied in a transparent,  objective and non-discriminatory manner. In <em>Meca  Medina</em> the ECJ considered whether the limit for the presence of the banned  substance in question in the athlete&rsquo;s body was disproportionate (i.e., too  low) and concluded that the rules did not go beyond what was necessary to  ensure the proper conduct of competitive sport. Consequently, the  proportionality of each sporting rule will have to be assessed on a  case-by-case basis while taking into account the relevant facts and  circumstances.</p>

                            <p> Where a restriction under Article 81(1) EC is found, such  restriction may be justified under Article 81(3). Article 81(3) EC provides  that the prohibition contained in Article 81(1) EC may be declared inapplicable  in case of agreements which contribute to improving the production or  distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while  allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits, and which do not  impose restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these  objectives and do not afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating  competition in respect of a substantial part of the products concerned. Such a justification is most likely to apply <strong>where  a rule is not inherent in the organisation or proper conduct of sport</strong> so as  to justify the application of <em>Wouters</em> but <strong>where the beneficial effects of a rule outweigh its restrictive effects</strong>.</p>

                            <p> The above considerations demonstrate that the application of  Articles 81 and 82 EC provides <strong>sufficient  flexibility</strong> to take account of the specificity of sport and does not impede  sporting rules that pursue a legitimate objective (such as the organisation and  proper conduct of sport), are indispensable (inherent) to achieve the objective  and proportionate in light of the objective pursued. At the same time, the  ECJ&rsquo;s <em>Meca Medina</em> judgment strongly  confirms that it is not possible to pre-determine an exhaustive list of sporting  rules which breach Article 81 and/or 82 EC (or of those which do not) as has  been suggested on various occasions.<a href="#_notes" title="[34]">[34]</a> The areas covered by sporting rules are much too wide and too diverse as to  possibly categorize them. Instead, it is necessary to examine the specific  requirements of Articles 81 and 82 EC in each individual case. It is therefore  only possible to clarify on a case-by case basis which rules do not breach  Articles 81 and 82 EC. The increasing body of case law at EU and national level  will, however, assist in identifying the types of rules that may normally be  considered not to infringe Articles 81 and 82 EC. A general exemption of  sporting rules or of activities of sports associations is therefore neither  possible nor warranted.</p>

                            <p> In the following, the document will summarize the existing  case law and practice as regards rules by sports associations relating to the  organisation of sport that have been found or are likely to comply with (see  <a href="#2_2_1" title="2.2.1.">2.2.1.</a>) and rules that have been found or are likely to breach (see <a href="#2_2_2" title="2.2.2.">2.2.2.</a>)  Article 81 or 82 EC. In this context, it must be re-emphasized that cases  relating to sport decided by the Community Courts prior to <em>Meca Medina</em> and <em>Piau</em> concerned EC Treaty provisions other than Articles 81 and 82 EC, in particular  the free movement of persons and services. The ECJ explicitly stated in <em>Meca Medina</em> that the fact that a  sporting rule does not violate Articles 39 and/or 49 EC does not exclude that  the rule may infringe Articles 81 and/or 82 EC, the requirements of which have  to be examined individually.<a href="#_notes" title="[35]">[35]</a> The fact that the Community Courts have in some cases found that sporting rules  did not violate Articles 39 and 49 EC does therefore not permit to conclude  that these rules do not infringe Articles 81 or 82 EC in the absence of an analysis concerning the anti-competitive effects,  the inherent nature and proportionality of the sporting rule in question.  Likewise, compliance with Articles 81 and 82 EC does not establish  compatibility with the internal market rules. In addition, as mentioned  above, the Commission has applied Articles 81 and 82 EC in several cases  concerning sport prior to the <em>Meca Medina</em> ruling. </p>
                            <p> The case law of the Community Courts and the decision-making  practice of the Commission discussed below do not address all the issues that  may arise or have arisen in the sport sector. Nor is the list of cases meant to  be exhaustive. However, the examples of cases may assist in clarifying as to  how to assess the compatibility of sporting rules with Articles 81 and 82 EC.</p>

                            <p> The following cases deal with a variety of issues such as  the participation in sport events, the territorial organisation of sport or the  multiple ownership of sport clubs. It is important to note that even rules that  pursued legitimate objectives and were inherent and necessary for the  organisation of sport have been found to violate Article 81 and/or 82 EC (or  Articles 39 and 49 EC) because they went beyond what was necessary. As a  result, it is not possible to generally exempt, for example, all rules relating  to the promotion of sport clubs/teams in league competitions. Each sport may  require different rules and each rule will have to be looked at individually.</p>

                                <strong><em>Deli&egrave;ge case.</em></strong> In <em>Deli&egrave;ge</em>,  the ECJ confirmed that the selection rules applied by a judoka federation to  authorise the participation of professional or semi-professional athletes in an  international sport competition inevitably limit the number of participants.  The ECJ found that such a limitation does not in itself restrict the freedom to  provide services, if it derives from an inherent need in the organisation of  the event in question and is not discriminatory.<a href="#_notes" title="[36]">[36]</a>  While the ECJ in <em>Deli&egrave;ge</em> did not  apply Articles 81 and 82 EC, it is likely that the rule in question would also  meet the <em>Meca Medina</em> test for Articles  81(1) and 82 EC as its effects would be inherent in the pursuance of a  legitimate objective (proper organisation of the sport event according to  certain selection rules) and would not be disproportionate.</p>

                                <strong><em>Mouscron case.</em></strong> The French communaut&eacute; urbaine de Lille had  lodged a complaint against UEFA under Article 82 EC as regards a rule for UEFA  competitions to the effect that each club must play its home match at its own  ground. The Belgian football club Excelsior Mouscron had thus been refused to  switch its home match in the 1997/98 UEFA Cup against FC Metz from Mouscron to  Lille. The Commission rejected the complaint as it considered the &ldquo;home and  away from home&rdquo; rule as well as the exceptions contained therein to constitute  a sporting rule that did not fall within the scope of Articles 81 and 82 EC.<a href="#_notes" title="[37]">[37]</a>  The Commission found that the organisation of football on a national  territorial basis was not called into question by Community law. The Commission  considered the rule indispensable for the organisation of national and  international competitions in view of ensuring equality of chances between  clubs. The Commission also found that the rule did not go beyond what was  necessary. It would appear likely that the rule would not constitute a  violation of Article 82 EC under the principles set forth in <em>Meca Medina</em> (assuming that the rule  restricts competition) since the rule pursues a legitimate objective (equality  of chances in club competitions), possible restrictions caused by the rule are  inherent in the organisation of club competitions and the rule is not  disproportionate.</p>
                            <p> The Commission considered that Lille was active in the <strong>market for the renting of stadiums</strong>. The  Commission also considered whether UEFA was dominant in the <strong>market for organising European club  competitions in football</strong> although the question was left open.</p>

The Commission rejected the complaint concluding that there was no  restriction of Article 81(1) EC because the objective of the rule was not to  distort competition, but to guarantee the integrity of the competitions  organised by UEFA.<a href="#_notes" title="[38]">[38]</a>  It concluded  that the rule &ldquo;<em>aims to ensure the  uncertainty of the outcome and to guarantee that the consumer has the  perception that the games played represent honest sporting competitions</em>&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#_notes" title="[39]">[39]</a>  The Commission also found that the rule did not go beyond what was necessary to  ensure its legitimate aim: <em>i.e</em>., to  protect the uncertainty of the results in the interest of the public.<a href="#_notes" title="[40]">[40]</a> In view of the above considerations, it would appear likely that the rule would  not infringe Article 81(1) EC on the basis of the <em>Wouters</em> criteria applied in <em>Meca  Medina</em>.</p>

In <em>Walrave</em> the ECJ stated that the rule of the International Cycling  Union (Union Cycliste Internationale, UCI) requiring that the pacemaker must be  of the same nationality as the stayer in &ldquo;world cycling championships behind  motorcycles&rdquo; was in compliance with EC law.<a href="#_notes" title="[41]">[41]</a>  While the ECJ in <em>Walrave</em> did not  apply Articles 81 and 82 EC, it is likely that the rule in question would also  meet the <em>Meca Medina</em> test for  Articles 81 and 82 EC as it pursued a legitimate objective for which it was  inherent (proper organisation of sport competitions with national teams).

                                <strong><em>Lehtonen case.</em></strong> The <em>Lehtonen</em><a href="#_notes" title="[43]">[43]</a> judgment concerned transfer rules of  the International Basketball  Federation concerning transfers of players within Europe. These rules,  implemented by the national basketball associations, prohibited clubs in Europe  fielding foreign players in national championships who had played in another  country in Europe, if they had been transferred after 28 February. After that  date it was still possible, however, for players from non-European clubs to be  transferred and to play. Mr Lehtonen, a Finnish player, had been transferred to  his Belgian club after that date and thus was not allowed to participate in the  championship. The ECJ found a restriction of Article 39 EC but considered that  the restriction could, in principle, be justified. The ECJ explicitly  acknowledged the important role of transfer deadlines in ensuring the  regularity of competition and observed that transfers late in the season may  upset the competitive balance and damage the effective functioning of a  championship.<a href="#_notes" title="[44]">[44]</a> In the case  at hand, however, the ECJ found that the rules went beyond what was necessary  to achieve the legitimate aim pursued.<br>
In view of the importance and necessity of transfer  deadlines for ensuring their objective, namely a fair and undistorted sport  competition, the Commission considers that the regulation of transfer periods  are likely to constitute sporting rules that do not infringe Articles 81(1) and  82 EC under <em>Meca Medina</em> (provided  they do not go beyond what is necessary, <em>e.g.</em>,  do not differentiate as regards the origin of a player or set transfer periods  that are too short)</p>

                            <p> Licensing requirements, such as rules on financial  management and financial stability, frequently have to be fulfilled in order to  participate in professional leagues. The objective of such licensing rules is  normally to ensure the financial stability of clubs/teams (and thus the  regularity of sport competitions) and the availability of proper and safe sport  facilities, <em>i.e</em>., aspects which are  inherent in, and necessary for, the organisation of sport. In view of this and  of the large number of different licensing requirements that may be devised by  sports associations, the rules included in such licensing systems which may  interfere with business decisions of clubs/teams would have to be reviewed very  carefully. Licensing rules may not go beyond what is necessary in order not to  infringe Articles 81 and 82 EC.</p>

                                <strong><em>FIA case.</em></strong> In the FIA case the Commission dealt with a conflict  of interest situation arising from the fact that a sport association was not  only the regulator but also the commercial exploiter of a sport. The F&eacute;d&eacute;ration  Internationale d&rsquo;Automobile (FIA) is the international association for motor  sport whose members, <em>inter alia</em>,  organise and regulate motor sport in their respective countries. FIA itself  also acted as organiser and promoter of motor sport championships, in  particular Formula One. In 1999, the Commission issued a Statement of  Objections (SO) concerning rules by FIA which prohibited drivers and race teams  that held a FIA licence from participating in non-FIA authorised events.  Circuit owners were prohibited from using the circuits for races which could  compete with Formula One. The Commission came to the preliminary conclusion  that these rules violated Articles 81(1) and 82 EC as they gave FIA the control  to block the organisation of races which competed with the events FIA promoted  or organised (<em>i.e</em>., those events from  which FIA derived a commercial benefit, in particular Formula One).<a href="#_notes" title="[45]">[45]</a> The Commission also objected to certain terms of the contracts between the  Formula One Administration Ltd (FOA, subsequently Formula One Management Ltd),  the company that administered the TV rights to Formula One races, and  broadcasters because they made it possible to block the organisation of motor  sport events that would compete with Formula One races. For example, the  agreement with broadcasters imposed a severe financial penalty on them if they  showed anything that would be deemed by FOA a competitive threat to Formula  One. Finally, the Commission objected to FIA rules according to which FIA  automatically acquired TV rights to all the motor sport events it authorised even  if these were promoted by a different promoter.</p>
                            <p> The Commission closed the case after having reached a  settlement in 2001.<a href="#_notes" title="[46]">[46]</a> The settlement provided in particular that FIA would:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> limit its role to that of a sport regulator without influence  over the commercial exploitation of the sport and thus removing any conflict of  interest (through the appointment by FIA of a &ldquo;commercial rights holder&rdquo; for  100 years in exchange for a one-off fee); </li>
                                <li> guarantee access to motor sport to any racing organisation and  to no longer prevent teams to participate in and circuit owners to organize  other races provided the requisite safety standards are met; </li>
                                <li> waive its TV rights or transfer them to the promoters  concerned; and<br>
    remove the anticompetitive clauses from the agreements between  FOA and broadcasters. </li>

FIA agreed to insert a new clause clarifying that anyone subject to FIA  decisions can challenge them before the national courts.<a href="#_notes" title="[47]">[47]</a> Similarly, the Commission insisted in the negotiations with FIFA on transfer  rules that arbitration would be voluntary and would not prevent recourse to  national courts, which led to FIFA modifying its transfer rules to this end.<a href="#_notes" title="[48]">[48]</a>

                            <p>
                                <strong><em>Bosman case.</em></strong> The Belgian football player Jean-Marc Bosman  agreed to transfer to the French club US Dunkerque shortly after his contract  with RC Liege had expired, but was unable to do so because the two clubs failed  to reach agreement on the transfer fee. The Belgian Football Federation then  refused to grant the required transfer approval to the French club. Because of  the delay caused, US Dunkerque withdrew the contract with Bosman. He brought an  action for compensation before the Belgian courts for loss of income,  requesting that the case be referred to the ECJ.</p>
                            <p> The ECJ found that the FIFA transfer rules requiring payment  of international end-of-contract transfer fees within the EU in respect of  players who are nationals of an EU Member State violated Article 39 EC.<a href="#_notes" title="[51]">[51]</a> Whereas the ECJ did not assess the transfer rules under Articles 81 and 82 EC,  Advocate General concluded in his Opinion that the transfer rules also violated  Article 81 EC because the transfer rules replaced the &ldquo;<em>normal system of supply and demand by a uniform machinery which leads  to the existing competition situation being preserved... [E]ven after the  contract has expired the player remains assigned to his former club for the  time being</em>.&rdquo;<a href="#_notes" title="[52]">[52]</a> Under  normal competitive conditions, a player would have been able to transfer freely  upon expiry of the contract and choose the club which offers the best terms.  The transfer rules restrict the possibilities of the clubs to compete with each  other by engaging players. </p>

                            <p>
                                <em>Bosman </em>did not  address the wider and more serious issue of the legality of the payment of  transfer fees for players who are still under contract. Following the <em>Bosman</em> case, transfer fees in football  had continued to spiral, peaking at the &euro;75m paid by Real Madrid to Juventus  Turin for Zinedine Zidane in 2001. However, the demanding of such a fee by the  selling club has the potential to severely restrict freedom of movement between  EU states for players. In 1998, the Commission issued a statement of objections  concerning FIFA&rsquo;s <em>international</em>transfer rules for contracted players  (&ldquo;Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players&rdquo;). Following negotiations  between the Commission and FIFA, the latter committed itself to modify its  transfer rules on the basis of certain principles.<a href="#_notes" title="[53]">[53]</a> In 2002, the Commission therefore decided to close its investigations.<a href="#_notes" title="[54]">[54]</a>

                            <p> The main principles agreed upon during the discussions with  FIFA and UEFA in 2002 were: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> measures to support the training of players, <em>e.g.</em> through training compensation for  young players (under the age of 23) and a solidarity mechanism in order to  redistribute a significant proportion of income to professional and amateur  clubs involved in the training of a player;</li>
                                <li> establishing a transfer period per season; </li>
                                <li> specification of contractual arrangements between  players and clubs, <em>e.g.</em> regulating  duration of contracts (a minimum duration of one year and a maximum duration of  five years) and specifying when breaches of contracts are possible (including sanctions);  and</li>
                                <li> ensuring that arbitration is voluntary and does not prevent  recourse to national courts in case of disputes.</li>

                                <strong><em>Piau case.</em></strong> The <em>Piau </em>judgment<a href="#_notes" title="[55]">[55]</a> concerned FIFA rules governing the profession of football agents through which  professional football players may conclude contracts with the clubs. Under the  FIFA rules, a contract in such case is valid only if the agent involved has a  licence for his/her practice issued by the national football association.  Licensed agents must pass an interview, have an impeccable reputation, and  deposit a bank guarantee. Mr Piau argued that the rules constituted a  restriction on competition under Articles 81 and 82 EC. As a result of the Commission&rsquo;s  investigation, FIFA removed the most restrictive limitations (for example, the  deposit was substituted by a liability insurance, the interview was replaced  with a multiple-choice test<em>, etc</em>.).  Following these amendments the Commission rejected the complaint, a decision  which was appealed by Mr Piau.</p>
                            <p> The aim of a football agent is to introduce a player for a  fee to a club or clubs to each other with a view of employment. The CFI  considered that this activity clearly does not pursue a purely sporting  interest. The CFI questioned the legitimacy of FIFA&rsquo;s right to regulate the  profession of football agents - which would normally be the prerogative of  public authorities -, a profession which is not specific to sport and which is  of unequivocally economic nature. However, the CFI acknowledged that the  players&rsquo; agent profession needs to be supervised by some entity, which, due to  the quasi total absence of national laws in this respect and the lack of  internal self-regulation among the agents<a href="#_notes" title="[56]">[56]</a> does not otherwise exist. The CFI upheld the Commission&rsquo;s conclusion that the  rules in question did not produce anti-competitive effects under Article 81(1)  EC, as the most restrictive rules had been modified by FIFA. The CFI also  agreed with the Commission that, even if such anti-competitive effects existed,  they could benefit from the exemption under Article 81(3) of the EC Treaty.</p>
                            <p> As regards Article 82 EC, the CFI considered that FIFA, as  the emanation of the national associations and the clubs - the actual buyers of  the services of players&rsquo; agents - was active in the market for players&rsquo; agents  through its members, and that it held a dominant position in this market. The  CFI stated, however, that an abuse could not be established, relying  essentially on the same arguments as those used in relation to Article 81 EC.  The CFI thus agreed with the conclusion in the Commission&rsquo;s decision that there  was no infringement of Article 82 EC. This judgment was upheld by the ECJ,  following appeal by Mr Piau.<a href="#_notes" title="[57]">[57]</a>

                            <p> There are currently a number of important outstanding legal  issues relating to the application of Articles 81 and 82 EC to sport, in  particular football. The three subjects which have attracted considerable  attention recently concern (i) FIFA&rsquo;s release of players&rsquo; rules<a href="#_notes" title="[58]">[58]</a>,  (ii) UEFA&rsquo;s home grown players&rsquo; rules<a href="#_notes" title="[59]">[59]</a> and (iii) the idea of introducing salary caps in professional football.<a href="#_notes" title="[60]">[60]</a> No formal decisions have been taken on these issues so far by the Community  courts or the Commission. Therefore, this document cannot at this stage,  provide a definite or exhaustive legal analysis of the problems involved or  establish whether these rules would violate Articles 81 or 82 EC.</p>

                            <p> Based on the case-law and considerations set out above, the  following types of rules constitute examples of &ldquo;sporting rules&rdquo; that &ndash; based  on their legitimate objectives &ndash; have been found or are likely <strong>not to infringe Articles 81(1) and/or 82 EC</strong> provided that the restrictions contained in such rules are inherent and  proportionate to the objectives pursued.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p> The following rules represent a <strong>higher likelihood of problems concerning compliance with Articles 81 EC  and/or 82 EC</strong>, although some of them could be justified under certain  conditions under Article 81(3) EC:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Rules protecting sports associations from competition;</li>
                                <li> Rules excluding legal challenges of decisions by sports  associations before national courts if the denial of access to ordinary courts  facilitates anti-competitive agreements or conduct;</li>
                                <li> Rules concerning nationality clauses for sport clubs/teams;</li>
                                <li> Rules regulating the transfer of athletes between clubs  (except transfer windows); and</li>
                                <li> Rules regulating professions ancillary to sport (<em>e.g.</em>, football players&rsquo; agents)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> The multi-faceted case law discussed above illustrates the  difficulty of any attempt to establish an exhaustive list of sporting rules  that can be automatically excluded from the scope of Articles 81 and 82 EC or  that can be automatically justified (or that automatically violate Article 81  or 82 EC). The compliance of sporting rules with Articles 81 and 82 EC  therefore will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. This has most  recently been established by the ECJ in <em>Meca  Medina</em> which rejected the notion that certain sporting rules may fall  outside the scope of Articles 81 and 82 EC if they are based on &ldquo;purely  sporting considerations&rdquo; and do not relate to economic activity. The ECJ held  that the specific requirements of Articles 81 and 82 EC need to be examined for  each and every sporting rule.</p>

                            <p> For many media operators sports media rights are crucial and  constitute &ldquo;<em>vital input</em>&rdquo;.<a href="#_notes" title="[63]">[63]</a> The Commission found as early as 1991 that &ldquo;<em>sport  is&hellip;particularly attractive to&hellip;commercial operators whether as part of general  entertainment channels or specialist channels. Audience ratings can be very  high</em><em>for certain events, and are also  popular with commercial sponsors</em>.&rdquo;<a href="#_notes" title="[64]">[64]</a> In later decisions the Commission stated, <em>e.g</em>.,  that movies and sports are &ldquo;<em>key sales  drivers</em>&rdquo; for pay-TV operators.<a href="#_notes" title="[65]">[65]</a> In view of the economic significance of broadcasting rights<a href="#_notes" title="[66]">[66]</a>,  the application of competition rules is of fundamental importance in this  sector.</p>
                            <p> Other than in the area of regulatory aspects of sport, the  exercise of economic activity is generally not a debated issue in the field of  sports media rights. All broadcasting  organisations, including public television broadcasting organisations, are  undertakings within the meaning of Articles 81 and 82 EC.<a href="#_notes" title="[67]">[67]</a> The activities of acquiring and sublicensing television rights and the sale of  advertising slots all constitute examples of activities of an economic nature  covered by Articles 81 and 82 EC.<a href="#_notes" title="[68]">[68]</a>
                                <br>
Competition relating to the sale and acquisition of sports  media rights has three important features. Firstly, the <strong>rapid evolution</strong> of the media sector including new technological  developments necessitates that market definitions are kept under constant  review.</p>
                            <p> Secondly, the <strong>supply  and demand structure</strong> as regards sports media rights is characterised by few  powerful players at each level of the supply chain, which are competing for  scarce and highly valuable sport rights: At the top of the value chain, in the <strong>upstream markets</strong>, initial rights owners  (usually sports associations or clubs) sell rights of sport events to sports  rights intermediaries, such as sports rights agencies or the European  Broadcasting Union (EBU)<a href="#_notes" title="[69]">[69]</a> or directly to retail operators. The <strong>downstream  transmission markets</strong> constitute the final stage of the value chain,  covering the provision of sports media services to consumers by retail  operators (<em>e.g</em>., broadcasting  companies, internet service providers, mobile operators).</p>
                            <p> Thirdly, sports  media rights are most attractive when broadcast live because once the outcome  of an event is known the value of the right declines together with viewer  interest.</p>
                            <p> It is also important to note that the &ldquo;Television without  frontiers&rdquo; Directive<a href="#_notes" title="[70]">[70]</a> in Article 3a sets out conditions allowing events which are considered to be of  major importance for society, including sport events, to be broadcast freely to  the public. Each Member State may therefore draw up a list of events which have  to be broadcast in unencoded form, even if exclusive rights have been purchased  by pay-TV channels.</p>

                            <p> Market definitions are particularly complex in the fast  changing world of media rights.<a href="#_notes" title="[71]">[71]</a> In the media sector, products and services are not always (or no longer)  clearly separable and are, also due to technological or economic &ldquo;convergence&rdquo;,  often marketed in a bundle.</p>
                            <p> In previous Commission decisions, <strong>upstream product markets</strong> for the acquisition of sports media rights  have been identified for certain audiovisual content. This was done on the  basis of specific criteria, such as brand image, the ability to attract a  particular audience, the configuration of that audience and  advertising/sponsoring revenues. With regard to sport events, the Commission  identified separate markets for the rights to broadcast sport events for the  first time in 1996.<a href="#_notes" title="[72]">[72]</a> Subsequently, the Commission has defined narrower markets, <em>e.g</em>., for (i) the broadcasting rights for certain major sport  events<a href="#_notes" title="[73]">[73]</a>,  (ii) the broadcasting (and new media<a href="#_notes" title="[74]">[74]</a>)  rights for football events played regularly throughout every year where  national teams participate<a href="#_notes" title="[75]">[75]</a> and (iii) the broadcasting rights for football events that do not take place  regularly where national teams participate.<a href="#_notes" title="[76]">[76]</a> In the recent <em>CVC/SLEC</em> decision, the  Commission left open the question, with respect to Italy and Spain, whether an  upstream market for major motor sport events (Formula One and Moto Grand Prix)  exists or whether the relevant market includes all regular major sport events  (excluding football).<a href="#_notes" title="[77]">[77]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> The main <strong>downstream  product markets</strong> that have been identified in past cases are: Pay TV<a href="#_notes" title="[78]">[78]</a>,  free TV, and content services delivered via the Internet and mobile devices.  With regard to TV markets, taking technological developments<a href="#_notes" title="[79]">[79]</a> and a limited degree of substitutability<a href="#_notes" title="[80]">[80]</a> into consideration, the Commission has repeatedly held that separate markets  exist for pay TV and free TV. This conclusion has been based on the different  trading relationships involved, the different conditions of competition, the  price of the services, and the characteristics of the two types of television.<a href="#_notes" title="[81]">[81]</a> With regard to new media, the Commission found in two recent decisions separate  downstream markets for on-demand sport content services delivered via wireless  mobile devices or via the Internet.<a href="#_notes" title="[82]">[82]</a> The findings of the sector inquiry into 3G, which was concluded in September  2005, confirmed the analysis with regard to mobile networks.<a href="#_notes" title="[83]">[83]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> With regard to the <strong>geographic  markets</strong> the Commission has held thus far that the <strong>downstream markets</strong> are of a national character or at least confined  to linguistic regions.<a href="#_notes" title="[84]">[84]</a> The geographical borders of the <strong>upstream  markets</strong> also tend to be national not only for national events (<em>e.g</em>., rights for national football  leagues) but also for international sport events since such rights are normally  also sold on a national basis. This is due to the national character of  distribution as a result of national regulatory regimes, language barriers and  cultural factors.<a href="#_notes" title="[85]">[85]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> Considering the technological developments, market  definitions may evolve in the future, warranting careful and continued market  research on the accuracy of the market definition for each case situation.</p>

                            <p> The Commission&rsquo;s decision making practice is limited thus  far to cases relating to the joint selling of exclusive rights under Article 81  EC. No decisions have been adopted with regard to the behaviour of a single  seller (<em>e.g</em>., sport associations or  sports rights agencies) under Article 82 EC. It is important to note that the  decisions and the remedies adopted in these decisions do not constitute an  exhaustive list of remedies for future cases but they merely represent possible  options to deal with competition issues arising in this area. The Commission  may decide to adopt additional or different remedies in future cases.</p>
                            <p> 3.1.3.1.1. Introduction</p>
                            <p> In the upstream market Article 81(1) EC applies to <strong>joint selling agreements</strong> leading to  competition restrictions, like foreclosure and output limitation, that would  unlikely have occurred in the absence of the agreements. Joint selling describes,  for example, the situation where sport clubs entrust the selling of their media  rights to their sports association which then sells the rights collectively on  their behalf. A joint selling arrangement is a horizontal agreement which  prevents the individual clubs each having a relatively small market share from  individually competing in the sale of sports media rights. One price is applied to all rights  collectively which constitutes price-fixing. In addition, the number of rights  available in the upstream acquisition markets is often reduced which may create  barriers to entry on downstream broadcasting markets and may lead to access  foreclosure in these markets.</p>
                            <p> The Commission has recognised that joint selling may create <strong>efficiencies</strong> and accepted joint selling  arrangements under Article 81(3) EC.<a href="#_notes" title="[86]">[86]</a> A joint selling arrangement has the potential of improving the media product  and its distribution to the advantage of football clubs, broadcasters and  viewers. The Commission in its decisions has in particular identified three  types of benefits:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> The creation of a <strong>single  point of sale</strong> provides efficiencies by reducing transaction costs for  football clubs and media operators</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Branding</strong> of the  output creates efficiencies as it helps the media products getting a wider  recognition and hence distribution</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The creation of a  league product</strong>: This is a product that is focused on the competition as a  whole rather than the individual football clubs participating in the  competition. This is attractive to many viewers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> In order to ensure that the positive effects of joint  selling outweigh the negative effects on competition, the Commission has sought  in past decisions to remedy the competition concerns resulting from the  collective sale of exclusive sports media rights by attaching conditions to a  declaration of exemption or making commitments binding on undertakings. The  accepted solution in each case depended on the facts of the individual case  including the degree of market power and the restrictive practices found.</p>
                            <p> A preliminary question that is of relevance for the  assessment of joint selling concerns the <strong>ownership  of the rights</strong>. In the <em>UEFA Champions  League</em> decision, the Commission considered that the rights for the matches  were not solely owned by UEFA, since the latter could at best be considered as  a co-owner of those rights together with the football clubs for individual  matches; the Commission also stated that the question of ownership is to be  determined by national law.<a href="#_notes" title="[87]">[87]</a> The question of the ownership is important because in cases where the rights  are solely owned, <em>e.g</em>., by the  football association<a href="#_notes" title="[88]">[88]</a>,  issues may arise under Article 82 EC rather than under Article 81 EC as the  sale of rights would be carried out by a single seller and not jointly.</p>
                            <p> 3.1.3.1.2. Decisions  adopted by the Commission</p>
                            <p> The Commission has decided on three major cases involving  joint selling of rights to broadcast games played by football clubs on the  basis of Article 81 EC, namely <em>UEFA  Champions League (UEFA CL)</em><a href="#_notes" title="[89]">[89]</a>,<em> German Bundesliga (DFB)</em><a href="#_notes" title="[90]">[90]</a> and<em> FA Premier League (FAPL)</em><a href="#_notes" title="[91]">[91]</a>.  In these cases the collectively sold exclusive sports rights risked to restrict  output and to foreclose access for operators on the downstream broadcasting  markets. In order to remedy the output restrictions and foreclosure effects  caused by collective selling in <em>UEFA CL,</em><em>DFB and FAPL</em> the Commission developed  a number of (non-exhaustive) remedies, see below under </p>
                            <p>3.1.3.1.3, and  established the conditions under which it considered that joint selling, in the  specific circumstances of each respective case, would be permissible under  Article 81 EC.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong><em>UEFA CL.</em></strong> In the <em>UEFA CL</em> decision the Commission for the first time accepted joint selling of football  media rights and laid out the principles for a pro-competitive rights  structure. The original arrangements  provided for the sale of UEFA Champions League free and pay-TV rights on an  exclusive basis in a single bundle to a single broadcaster per territory for  several years in a row. Buyers had only one source of supply and a single large  broadcaster per territory would acquire all free and pay-TV rights, to the  exclusion of all others, resulting in a number of rights being left unexploited  and output restrictions. Following Commission intervention, UEFA amended its  joint selling arrangements. The available rights were unbundled into several  packages (in total 14) enabling more than one broadcaster to acquire rights to  the UEFA Champions League. The packages were sold on the basis of an objective  and non-discriminatory tender procedure. Although UEFA had the exclusive right  to sell the packages of live rights, individual clubs could sell certain live  rights (package 4) relating to their matches, in case UEFA would fail to sell.<br>
Certain restrictions  remained however. Indeed, the exclusive sale of live rights by UEFA still  prevented individual clubs from competing in the sale of those rights, a single  price was fixed, broadcasters only had one point of supply in respect of most  live rights and the exploitation of deferred rights was subject to limitations.<br>
On the other hand,  the Commission considered that joint selling also led to a number of positive  effects and the Commission concluded that the amended joint selling agreement  met the conditions for a justification under Article 81(3) EC.</p>
                            <p> The joint selling <strong>improved  the distribution of rights</strong> to the UEFA Champions League through the  creation of a quality branded product, exploited exclusively by UEFA and  independent of the interests of individual clubs. The single point of sale  enabled the acquisition of coverage for the whole UEFA Champions League season,  allowing programming to be planned in advance. The only alternative to ensure  coverage of the entire league would have been to acquire rights from many  individual clubs. However, due to the knock-out nature of the UEFA Champions  League this meant that a broadcaster could not know in advance which clubs  would make it through to the end. Such an exercise was uneconomic especially as  the value of individual club rights would plummet if that club was eliminated. The  single point of sale therefore ensured full coverage and reduced the  broadcasters&rsquo; financial risk. Distribution was further improved by ensuring  that certain live rights could be sold by individual clubs where UEFA had been  unable to sell the rights within one week after the draw for the first round  for the UEFA Champions League.<br>
                                <strong>Consumers benefited</strong> directly from the improved distribution of rights and increased coverage  created by the joint selling. In addition, the efficiencies created by the  single point of sale allowed broadcasters to invest more in improving  production and transmission. Access to deferred and archived content was also  made more readily accessible.</p>
                            <p> The Commission  considered that the restrictions on competition were <strong>indispensable</strong> to  the creation of a UEFA Champions League branded product sold via a single point  of sale and the related benefits. UEFA had a legitimate interest in creating a  Champions League focused product separate from the interests of individual  clubs, as it benefited UEFA, the clubs and the supporters/viewers of the  Champions League. The exclusive joint selling of live rights, without parallel  sales through individual clubs was also indispensable to ensuring the quality  and attractiveness of the UEFA Champions League product to broadcasters.</p>
                            <p> The joint selling  arrangements were <strong>not likely to eliminate competition</strong> in respect of a  substantial part of the football rights market because substitutable rights to  other football events taking place regularly throughout the year were available  (<em>e.g</em>., national football league  rights). In addition, both UEFA and individual clubs sold a number of  categories of UEFA Champions League rights in parallel ensuring multiple  sources of supply for interested buyers.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong><em>DFB and FAPL.</em></strong> In the  sales process of the German and English top national football leagues, the  Bundesliga and the FAPL respectively, similar competition concerns arose as  those found in <em>UEFA CL</em>.<a href="#_notes" title="[92]">[92]</a> In order to address these concerns, in both cases commitments were made to  amend the original joint selling arrangements by the respective leagues on  behalf of their individual club members.<strong></strong>The commitments offered by both  the <em>Deutscher Liga-Fu&szlig;ballverband</em> (the German Leage Association (GLA), the rights-holder for the Bundesliga  matches) and the FAPL (the rights holder for the Premiership matches) were made  legally binding under Article 9(1) of Regulation 1/2003. The commitments from  both the GLA and the FAPL included the unbundling of rights into separate  rights packages for TV broadcasting and mobile platforms, the possibility for individual clubs to exploit certain unsold rights  and rights unused by the initial purchaser, as well as the exploitation of  deferred rights and rights for the new internet broadcasting<a href="#_notes" title="[93]">[93]</a> and telephony broadcasting markets. Rights were to be disposed of using  a public tender procedure and exclusive rights contracts were not to exceed  three football seasons.</p>
                            <p> In addition, as  regards the FAPL, the open and competitive bidding process for the rights  packages was made subject to scrutiny by an independent Monitoring Trustee.  Furthermore, no single purchaser was allowed to acquire all the live rights  packages, as first applied from the sale of rights to the 2007/2008 season (<strong>no  single buyer rule</strong>). This commitment was negotiated by the Commission in  order to end the monopoly of British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (&ldquo;BSkyB&rdquo;) over  the rights to the FAPL in the United Kingdom. Following the acquisition in May  2006 of two of the six FAPL live rights packages by Setanta, an Irish pay-TV  sports channel, BSkyB ceased to be the exclusive holder of live Premier League  matches.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>The Commission's practice highlights a number of possible approaches  which, separately or in combination, have been used in order to address  competition concerns resulting from joint selling arrangements concerning  exclusive sports media rights under Article 81 EC. The list of remedies below  is not exhaustive or binding for future cases and different or new  remedies may be adopted depending on the specific circumstances of a given  case.</p>
                            <p>3.1.3.2.1. Tendering</p>
                            <p> In order to reduce the risk of <strong>foreclosure</strong> effects in the downstream markets in <em>UEFA CL</em>, <em>DFB </em>and<em> FAPL</em> the  Commission required the collective sellers on the upstream market to organise a  competitive bidding process under non-discriminatory and transparent terms  (&ldquo;non-discriminatory and transparent <strong>tendering</strong>&rdquo;).  This approach gives all potential buyers an opportunity to compete for the  rights.</p>
                            <p> 3.1.3.2.2. Limitation  of the duration of exclusive vertical contracts</p>
                            <p> The Commission acknowledges the need for a certain degree of  exclusivity to protect the value of sports media rights, in particular live  rights. The risk of long-term market <strong>foreclosure</strong> has been addressed in <em>UEFA CL,</em><em>DFB</em> and <em>FAPL</em> by requiring the collective selling entity to limit the <strong>duration</strong> of the exclusive rights  offered in vertical contracts to no more than three football seasons (&ldquo;sun  setting&rdquo;).<a href="#_notes" title="[94]">[94]</a> Longer contract duration would risk creating a situation where a successful  buyer would be able to establish a dominant position on the downstream market  reducing the scope for effective <em>ex ante </em>competition  in the context of future bidding rounds.</p>
                            <p> 3.1.3.2.3. Limitation  of the scope of exclusive vertical contracts</p>
                            <p> In <em>UEFA CL,</em><em>DFB</em> and <em>FAPL</em> the Commission sought to limit the risk of market <strong>foreclosure</strong> resulting from a single  buyer acquiring all the valuable rights - by obliging the collective selling  entity to unbundle the media rights in separate packages, thereby limiting the  scope of the exclusivity. More specifically the Commission required:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>A reasonable amount of  different packages</strong>: The creation of two or more independently valid live  packages was required. The reason for this was that as live rights are often  sold to one media operator, the creation of various packages would enable more  than one media operator to acquire the rights. </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Meaningful packages</strong>:  The large size of packages may create foreclosure concerns and the Commission  has, <em>e.g</em>. in <em>FAPL</em>, requested the sale of several meaningful packages to enable  also less powerful operators with less financial means to bid for the packages  that suited their needs. At the same time, a package may not be &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo;  (independently valid) if it is much smaller than other packages. The objective  is to allow the respective purchasers of the package(s) to compete effectively  on the downstream market.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Earmarked packages</strong> for special markets/platforms: Due to the strong asymmetric value of rights for  different distribution platforms, access to sports media rights may be  foreclosed to downstream market operators in certain evolving markets or  platforms (for example 3G networks or internet markets). By providing for  specific packages for certain distribution platforms ("earmarking")  in <em>UEFA CL,</em><em>DFB</em> and <em>FAPL </em>mobile  operators and internet service providers were enabled to acquire rights.<a href="#_notes" title="[95]">[95]</a>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>No conditional bidding: </strong>In <em>FAPL</em>, an obligation was  imposed on the seller to accept only stand-alone unconditional bids for each  individual package.<a href="#_notes" title="[96]">[96]</a> The rights  would be sold to the highest standalone bidder. Such unconditional selling is  aimed at preventing a powerful buyer interested in acquiring the most valuable  package(s) from offering a bonus on condition that all the valuable rights are  sold to it, thus inciting initial rights owners not to sell at least some  packages to competitors in the same market or operators in neighbouring  markets.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> 3.1.3.2.4. Fall-back  option, use obligation, parallel exploitation</p>
                            <p> In order to limit the risk of <strong>output restrictions</strong> caused by the collective sale of exclusive  rights, the Commission required in <em>UEFA  CL,</em><em>DFB </em>and<em> FAPL</em> that there should be <strong>no  unused rights</strong>. Rights that are not sold by the collective entity within a  certain time period fell back to the individual clubs for parallel exploitation  (&ldquo;<strong>no hoarding).</strong> In addition, the  Commission ensured market availability of less valuable rights such as deferred  highlights and new media rights by imposing the <strong>parallel exploitation</strong> of these rights by individual clubs and UEFA  in <em>UEFA CL</em>. </p>
                            <p> 3.1.3.2.5.  No single  buyer obligation</p>
                            <p> In order to prevent that all packages of valuable live  rights were sold to the dominant pay-TV operator in the United Kingdom, BSkyB,  the Commission considered it necessary to impose a <strong>no single buyer </strong>obligation on the collective selling entity in the  FAPL decision. Over a number of years prior to the <em>FAPL </em>decisionBSkyB had  acquired all the valuable live-TV packages that were made available on the  market by the joint seller. Additional remedies were therefore deemed necessary  to prevent downstream foreclosure and to ensure access also of other market  players. Importantly, in the absence of such remedies there was a risk that  competition would remain eliminated well beyond the duration of any on-going  contract as due to the long-term presence of the dominant buyer competition was  ineffective. It is noteworthy that these considerations were of relevance only  in <em>FAPL</em> whereas due to the structure  of the markets the issue did not arise in the <em>UEFA CL</em> and <em>DFB</em> cases.<a href="#_notes" title="[97]">[97]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> It should be noted in this context that in the <em>DFB </em>decision the Commission reserved the  possibility of opening a separate investigation at the downstream level in case  several packages with exclusive exploitation rights would be acquired by a  single purchaser (&ldquo;<strong>vertical reserve</strong>&rdquo;).<a href="#_notes" title="[98]">[98]</a> Such an investigation would thus target the dominant buyer rather than the  seller.<a href="#_notes" title="[99]">[99]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> 3.1.3.2.6. Trustee</p>
                            <p> The Commission in <em>FAPL</em> also required that the tender procedure was overseen by a <strong>trustee</strong> that reported back to the Commission to ensure and  guarantee that the tender procedure was undertaken in a fair, reasonable a  non-discriminatory manner.</p>

                            <p> In the downstream markets <strong>joint buying arrangements</strong> may also be caught under Article 81(1)  EC, in particular when the exclusive acquisition of sports media rights leads  to foreclosure and output restrictions as a result of vertical restraints in  agreements between seller and buyer or by horizontal agreements between  different buyers. In cases where <em>ex ante</em> (single or collective) dominance exists at the acquisition market, under  certain circumstances the acquisition and use of exclusive sports media rights  could constitute an abuse of dominance by the buyer within the meaning of  Article 82 EC.</p>

                                <strong>Foreclosure issues </strong>are  especially relevant whenever exclusive rights constitute &ldquo;premium&rdquo; content. In  such situations (mostly concerning broadcasting rights for live football  matches), competition may be adversely affected through the monopolisation of  the acquisition of this premium content, if this content is an essential input  for effective competition in the <strong>downstream  market</strong>.<a href="#_notes" title="[100]">[100]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> In addition, because of insecurity about technological  developments, the existence of some substitution between different platforms  and asymmetric value of rights, powerful operators on one retail market may  seek to prevent players in neighbouring markets<strong></strong>from<strong></strong>acquiring  meaningful rights. The acquisition of exclusive audiovisual rights for all  platforms by a powerful retail operator in one downstream market (<em>e.g</em>., a pay-TV operator) may create  additional anti-competitive <strong>foreclosure  effects in neighbouring markets </strong>(<em>e.g</em>.,  3 G mobile telephony), thereby hampering the development of new services.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Output restrictions</strong> may occur when exclusive rights, which are either bought collectively by  different operators or bought by a dominant firm for one or more downstream  markets, are subsequently not exploited by the buyers.</p>

                            <p> The Commission has dealt with a number of cases where  remedies were necessary to address situations where a powerful retail operator  (or a joint buying consortium of retail operators) on one platform foreclosed access  to exclusive content for operators in the same or neighbouring markets.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong><em>Newscorp/Telepi&ugrave;</em></strong>.<a href="#_notes" title="[101]">[101]</a> The merger brought  together Italy&rsquo;s two satellite pay-TV platforms, one of which (Telepi&ugrave;) was  already dominant in the market. The new entity, SkyItalia, would have held  almost a 100% share of the pay-TV market, with competition from other platforms  being unlikely due to cable penetration in Italy being only around 1%. The  merged entity would have combined for a long duration an unparalleled portfolio  of exclusive rights related to premium content (also including key sport  events), thereby foreclosing third parties from accessing premium content  needed to establish competing pay-TV offers downstream.<br>
Although Italian law provided that football rights must be sold to at  least two buyers, this could not apply where there was only one company in the  market.<a href="#_notes" title="[102]">[102]</a> Consequently, the Commission found that the merger would have created a near  monopoly in the Italian pay-TV market by strengthening the already dominant  position of Telepiu. It would also have created a quasi-monopoly in the various  markets for the acquisition of content for pay-TV and would have foreclosed  access to such content to potential competitors. Hold-back and black-out rights  would have foreclosed the market and prevented new entry through the use of  platforms other than satellite in the future. The merger was only cleared  following the giving of substantial commitments by the new entity, ensuring  access to its technical platform, limiting the exclusivity of its rights to its  satellite platform and limiting the duration of its exclusive rights to  attractive content (including football rights) to two years.</p>

                                <strong><em>Eurovision/EBU.</em></strong> The  European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is an association of national broadcasters  based largely in Europe. Its members principally consist of broadcasters  providing a service of national character and importance for all sections of  the public. Members of EBU may participate in EBU&rsquo;s Eurovision system, which  consists of a TV programme exchange system, pursuant to which EBU members  offer, <em>inter alia</em>, sports coverage to  other EBU members on a reciprocal basis. As part of the system, EBU members  participate in the joint acquisition and subsequent sharing of sports media  rights, including the free exchange of transmission signal in respect of the  relevant sport events. The  effects on competition of the joint purchasing of sports rights, through EBU&rsquo;s  Eurovision system, have been considered twice by both the Commission<a href="#_notes" title="[103]">[103]</a> and the CFI<a href="#_notes" title="[104]">[104]</a>. In both  cases, the Commission found restrictions under Article 81(1) EC and exempted  the respective joint purchasing agreements under Article 81(3) EC. The CFI in  each case annulled the Commission&rsquo;s decisions. Following the CFI&rsquo;s  judgment, the Commission is currently reviewing the Eurovision Rules under  Article 81 EC.</p>

                                <strong><em>AVS.</em></strong> The Commission's AVS investigation concerned an agreement  between Telef&oacute;nica and Sogecable, the two largest Spanish pay-TV platforms,  whereby they committed to jointly acquire and exploit the rights to the Spanish  First League for 11 seasons (until 2009) through their joint venture  Audiovisual Sport (AVS). In November 2000, the Commission closed parts of its  investigation concerning foreclosure effects on the Spanish pay-TV markets  after the parties granted access to the football rights to new cable and  digital terrestrial television entrants in Spain and guaranteed competitors  that they were free to set the prices of the pay-per-view football matches.<a href="#_notes" title="[105]">[105]</a> The Commission continued its investigation as regards the long duration of the  agreement, the rights of first refusal of the parties for a large number of  Spanish football clubs and the potentially unfair and discriminatory terms and  conditions of the parties' sublicensing rules. The Commission closed its investigation  in May 2003 following the merger of Sogecable and Via Digital of Telef&oacute;nica.  The merger was authorised in November 2002 by the Spanish authorities under  certain conditions which (i) abolished the renewal options held by AVS on the  football rights, (ii) guaranteed third parties' access to the rights under  fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions, (iii) established that the  merged entity would not have exclusive use of the new media rights and (iv)  stipulated that access to the football rights would be subject to an  arbitration mechanism.<a href="#_notes" title="[106]">[106]</a>

                            </p>
                            <p> It is important to re-emphasize that the remedies adopted in  previous decisions are not exhaustive or binding for future cases. They  merely represent possible options to deal with competition issues arising in  this area. The Commission may decide to adopt additional or different remedies  in future cases.<br>
As will be explained below, remedies can either consist of <strong>behavioural solutions</strong> imposed upon  downstream players, such as sublicensing of rights in the same market or  neighbouring markets, or of <strong>structural  solutions</strong> requiring the divestiture of rights in the same or neighbouring  markets. As in other areas structural solutions are generally more effective.  Moreover, in the media sector experience shows that sublicensing is a difficult  remedy to apply in practice as it must be ensured that prices and sublicensing  conditions are transparent and acceptable. Given that sub-licensing is  generally not in the sub-licensor&rsquo;s interest it may be necessary to involve a  trustee to ensure a satisfactory degree of effectiveness. If remedies cannot  solve the competition concerns, the (joint) acquisition of sports media rights  may also be prohibited.</p>
                            <p> 3.1.4.2.1. Limitation  of the scope of exclusivity with regard to neighbouring markets</p>
                            <p> In <em>Newscorp/Telepi&ugrave;</em>,Newscorp offered commitments to waive  its exclusivity and its protective rights on means of transmission other than  the satellite platform on which it was active itself.<a href="#_notes" title="[107]">[107]</a> Therefore, operators on other platforms (<em>e.g</em>.,  internet, cable, UMTS) were able to buy those contents (including for football  and other sport events) directly from rights owners and have in fact done so.<br>
A system of &ldquo;wholesale offer&rdquo; of premium content was also  put in place, whereby Newscorp had to sublicense acquired &ldquo;premium content&rdquo;  rights on a non-exclusive basis to third parties active on means of  transmission other than satellite.<a href="#_notes" title="[108]">[108]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> 3.1.4.2.2. Limitation  of duration of exclusivity</p>
                            <p> Limiting the<strong> duration</strong> of the exclusivity assures that other market players will be able to acquire  rights at regular intervals. In <em>Newscorp/Telepi&ugrave; </em>the company committed itself to limit the duration of its exclusive rights  to two years.<a href="#_notes" title="[109]">[109]</a>

                            <p> The remedies described above are examples of remedies that  have been used to date to address competition concerns arising in the area of  sports media rights. However, it is important to note that there is no  &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; approach that applies to cases involving  sports media rights. The Commission will have to carefully assess each  individual case in order to determine, where necessary, the appropriate remedy  or remedies, taking into account the specific facts and circumstances, in particular  also considering the technological developments of the relevant markets.</p>

                            <p> As a general matter, similar issues arise in cases  concerning ticketing arrangements for sport events as in ticketing arrangements  for other events. However, there are some special characteristics as regards  ticketing for sport events relating in particular to safety aspects such as the  effective segregation of rival groups of supporters<a href="#_notes" title="[110]">[110]</a> and the counterfeiting of tickets.</p>
                            <p> In assessing ticketing arrangements, the Commission has  taken as its guiding principle that these arrangements should ensure that <strong>all  consumers in the EEA have reasonable access to entry tickets</strong>. Particular  attention has in past cases been paid to exclusive distribution agreements,  territorial restrictions on ticket sales and restrictions in payment methods  (credit card exclusivity).</p>

                            </h4>
                            <p> In view of the fact that tickets for sport events are often  sold by or through a single entity (<em>e.g</em>.,  the organising committees of the respective World Cups), Article 82 EC has  played an important role in cases involving ticketing arrangements (although  Article 81 EC may also apply in these cases). In order to determine the market  position of the ticket-selling undertaking(s) under Article 82 EC (but also  under Article 81 EC), it is therefore necessary to define the relevant product  and geographic markets. In general, the relevant product markets will be the <strong>market for the sale of tickets for the  sport event in question</strong>. Tickets for sport events, in particular popular  sport events such as, <em>e.g</em>., the  Olympic Games or football World Cups or European Championships are normally not  substitutable by tickets for other sport events.<a href="#_notes" title="[111]">[111]</a>
                            </p>
                            <p> Depending, <em>inter alia</em>,  on the different types of tickets, packages of tickets or selling methods, <strong>separate sub-markets</strong> may be identified.  For example, in the <em>1998 World Cup</em> decision the Commission found two separate markets for (i) the sale of &ldquo;blind  Pass France 98&rdquo; tickets (entitling the buyer to view all first round matches  and one match of the round of the last 16 in the same stadium) and (ii) the  sale of &ldquo;blind individual tickets&rdquo; (relating to the opening match, quarter and  semi-finals, third place play-off and the final).<a href="#_notes" title="[112]">[112]</a> These ticket arrangements differed, <em>e.g.,</em> from the ticketing arrangements for the 2006 World Cup. Ticket sales for the  2006 World Cup included, for example, team specific tickets (TST) which allowed  the buyer to follow a certain national team up to the final, depending on the  team&rsquo;s performance. Also, other than in 1998, there were no &ldquo;geographic&rdquo; ticket  packages on the basis of a given stadium. The market(s) for the sale of tickets  for each sport event will therefore have to be carefully analysed on a  case-by-case basis taking into account in particular the specific sales  arrangements.</p>
                            <p> The definition of the <strong>geographic  market</strong> will depend on the type of sport event. For important international  sport events (Olympic Games, football World Cup <em>etc</em>.), the geographic market will be at least EEA-wide in scope,  due to the widespread demand for these tickets.<a href="#_notes" title="[113]">[113]</a> For sport events of primarily national interest (<em>e.g</em>., national track and field championships) the scope may be  national or even regional in scope (<em>e.g</em>.,  ticket sales for football clubs with mainly local followers).</p>

                            <p> The Commission decision relating to ticketing arrangements  for the 1990 Football World Cup<a href="#_notes" title="[114]">[114]</a> was concerned with the exclusive worldwide distribution of package tours  combined with tickets for the 1990 World Cup without the possibility of  alternative sources of supply. The World Cup Organising Committee, set up  jointly by the Italian football association and FIFA for the technical and  logistical organization of the World Cup<a href="#_notes" title="[115]">[115]</a>,  had undertaken to confer on a single travel agency (90 Tour Italia SpA)  worldwide exclusive rights for the supply of stadium entrance tickets for the  purpose of putting together package tours. Other travel agencies or tour operators  could therefore not obtain tickets from any other source than 90 Tour Italia  SpA. The Commission took the view that this exclusive distribution system  infringed Article 81 EC because it restricted competition between tour  operators and between travel agencies in the EU on the market for the sale of  package tours to the 1990 World Cup. The restrictions could not be justified  under Article 81(3) EC on stadium safety grounds as a number of tour operators  fulfilling the same criteria as 90 Tour Italia could have competed on the  market without jeopardising spectator safety. The Commission therefore found an  infringement of Article 81 EC but did not impose fines, <em>inter alia</em>, because it was the first time it had taken action on  the distribution of tickets for a sporting event.<br>
Following the 1990 World Cup decision, the organising  committees of the Barcelona and Albertville Olympic Games amended their  contractual agreements to allow nationals of the EU Member States also to buy  tickets directly from the organising committees or from travel agents  distributing them in other EU Member States.</p>

In  particular, the general public throughout the EEA could only purchase certain  match tickets on condition that they provided an address in France to which the  tickets could be delivered. The practical effect of such a requirement was to  deprive the overwhelming majority of citizens outside France of the possibility  of purchasing any of the tickets in question. In addition, non-French residents  were restricted to reserving tickets by means of written application while  French residents could avail themselves of other, quicker means including  reservation by telephone or by accessing the electronic French Minitel system.  The Commission only imposed a symbolic fine of &euro;1000 because of the legal  uncertainty concerning ticket arrangements under EC law at the time<a href="#_notes" title="[117]">[117]</a> and steps undertaken by the organising committee to ensure access of EU  consumers to more tickets.</p>

                            <p> The Commission has also examined credit card exclusivity  arrangements for sport events in two cases: the VISA exclusivity for ticket  sales via the internet for the Athens Olympic Games in 2004, and the MasterCard  exclusivity for direct sales of tickets for the FIFA Football World Cup 2006.</p>

                                <strong><em>2004 Athens Olympic Games</em></strong>. In the Athens Olympic Games, tickets ordered via the internet directly  from the organising committee (&lsquo;ATHOC&rsquo;) could only be paid for with VISA cards.  The Commission took the view (Case 38703) that this exclusivity did not  constitute an infringement of Articles 81 or 82 if consumers in the EEA had <strong>reasonable access to tickets</strong> via  alternative sales channels that did not require payment with VISA cards. Such  an alternative supply channel for the general public was available in that  tickets could be bought from any National Olympic Committee in the EEA as the  latter accepted other payment methods. ATHOC also agreed to improve the  information to consumers regarding all options for the purchase of tickets and  by intervening with the National Olympic Committees in the EEA. The case was  subsequently closed without a decision.<a href="#_notes" title="[118]">[118]</a>

                                <strong><em>2006 Germany World Cup.</em></strong> The 2006 World Cup case was triggered by a  complaint from a UK consumer organisation &lsquo;Which?&rsquo; against FIFA and the German  Football Association under Article 82 EC (Case 39177) concerning the MasterCard exclusivity arrangements for tickets intended for the  general public. The Commission followed the same  guiding principle as in the Athens Olympic Games case, <em>i.e</em>., there should be <strong>reasonable  access</strong><strong> to tickets</strong> for all consumers in the  EEA. Tickets from the World Cup Organising Committee  (&lsquo;OC&rsquo;) could be paid for with MasterCard credit card,  direct debit from a German bank account or international (cross-border) bank  transfer. However, in the latter case, significant costs  could arise for consumers in EEA countries outside the Eurozone, such as the  United Kingdom. In light of the enormous demand for tickets and the importance  of direct sales by the OC, the Commission was of the opinion that there needed to be a viable alternative to the direct sales by the  OC to ensure reasonable access to tickets for the World Cup 2006 for those  consumers who did not possess a MasterCard product. This alternative could take  the form of (i) other payment forms for direct sales by the OC (<em>i.e</em>., more than one credit card and/or  bank transfers without dissuasive additional costs for the consumers), or (ii)  other sales channels for which there is no credit card exclusivity. As a  result, the OC set up local currency accounts enabling fans based in non-Eurozone countries in the EEA to  pay for tickets by making domestic bank transfers. The complaint was subsequently withdrawn and the case was closed without  a decision.<a href="#_notes" title="[119]">[119]</a>

[27] <em>Piau, supra</em>, para. 75. Rules drawn up unilaterally  by sporting associations consisting of undertakings will usually constitute  decisions by an association of undertakings (see, <em>e.g</em>., Commission decision <em>ENIC/UEFA</em>,  para. 26, for a rule drawn up by the UEFA Executive Committee and C-519/04 P <em>Meca Medina, supra</em>, para. 45 for a rule  drawn up by the IOC and implemented by the International Swimming Federation).<br>

Rules adopted  by international sport associations will normally affect trade between Member  States. However, in view of the fact that rules of national sport associations  usually concern a sport in the whole territory of a given Member State and in  light of today&rsquo;s high level of internationalisation of professional sport,  rules adopted by national sport associations may often affect trade between  Member States.<br>

[31]  The test adopted by  the ECJ for sporting rules under Article 81 EC differs from the test under  Articles 39 and 49 EC where the ECJ examines whether the sporting rule in  question is of &ldquo;purely sporting interest&rdquo; (in which case the Articles 39 and 49  EC do not apply) or is based on &ldquo;reasons of an economic nature&rdquo; (in which case  Articles 39 and 49 EC apply); see, e.g,, Case C-176/96 <em>Lehtonen et al v.

[56]  While the Commission recognizes the right of  self-regulation for players' agents or other professions ancillary to sport,  such self-regulation would also need to comply with EC competition law.<br>
[57] Order of the ECJ of  23 January 2006, Case C-171/05P, ECR 2006 I-37<br>
[58] The FIFA  Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players (Articles 36 to 41) make it  compulsory for football clubs to release their players for matches of their  national teams. Clubs are responsible to insure the players for accident and  insurance during such release period and are not entitled to receive financial  compensation or damages if the players get injured. These rules are contested  by a number of European football clubs and form the subject of a number of  legal proceedings. A reference for a preliminary ruling on the compatibility of  this rule with Community law, including Articles 81 and 82 EC concerning the  case <em>SA Sporting du Pays de Charleroi and G-14 Groupement des clubs de  football europ&eacute;ens/FIFA </em>(the so-called Charleroi case) is currently pending  before the ECJ (case C-243/06, OJ C 212, 2 September 2006, p.11)<br>
[59] UEFA plans to  introduce a rule setting a minimum number of "home grown  players" for clubs to be eligible for the UEFA football competitions.  Clubs entering UEFA competitions would have to have a certain number of  "locally trained" players, defined as players who have been  registered for three seasons/years with the club between the ages of 15 and 21.<br>
[60] Salary cap is a limit on the amount of money a team  can spend on player salaries, either as a per-player limit or a total limit for  the team's roster (or both). Salary caps are more common, e.g., in North  American sport leagues but do exist in some European countries (e.g., for  certain rugby leagues in England). There have been calls from some European  football clubs to introduce salary caps in football.<br>
[61] Some of these rules may not involve economic  activity and would, as such, fall outside the scope of application of EC  competition law.<br>
[62]  Licensing systems  are not included in the list due to the absence of case-law involving EC  competition rules on this subject.<br>

[92] These were cases of  principally national character that had been opened by the Commission prior to  modernisation. In the case of <em>DFB</em>, it  is also noteworthy that the German Act against Restraints on Competition  contained an exception for the joint selling of sports media rights between  1999 and 2005. Following modernisation, it is less likely &ndash; but not excluded &ndash;  that the Commission would intervene in this type of cases<br>
[93] The internet  broadcasting rights were sold as a separate package in <em>DFB</em> but not in <em>FAPL</em>
                                <br>
[94] In <em>Newscorp/Telepiu, supra,</em> the commitments  offered went even further; the notifying party undertook to buy football rights  for no longer than two seasons at the time and only for satellite distribution<br>
[95]  In the <em>Bundesliga</em> decision, three separate  packages for live rights were earmarked for (i) TV (pay-TV and free-TV), (ii)  internet and (iii) mobile phones. In the <em>Premier  League</em> decision, only two separate packages for live rights were earmarked  for (i) audio-visual rights on a "<em>technology  neutral basis</em>" (including pay-TV, free-TV and internet) and (ii)  audio-visual mobile rights. This was due to the increasing convergence of the  TV and internet platforms (<em>e.g</em>., as a  result of IPTV). The question as to which type of markets or platforms should  be earmarked (<em>e.g</em>., to protect or  encourage their development) will depend in particular on the market conditions  in the country/countries in question<br>
[96] <em>FAPL, supra</em>, para. 40 and points 7.5 to  7.7 of the FAPL commitments<br>
[97]  In <em>UEFA CL</em> there was no need to examine the  individual national market situations. In <em>DFB </em>there was also no need at that time to look into the vertical effects,  considering the value of the different packages and the distribution of market  players (also taking into account the bankruptcy of Kirch which had previously  acquired the Bundesliga rights)<br>
[98] <em>DFB, supra</em>, para. 35. The <em>ex ante</em> risk that one single buyer would  acquire all the packages in a non-discriminatory tender procedure was rather  small, as due to the bankruptcy of the company <em>Kirch</em> no powerful pay-TV operator was present in the German  downstream market<br>
[99]  However, it would  not be excluded to act also against the joint seller as the emergence on the  market of a dominant buyer would likely constitute a material new fact within  the meaning of Article 9(2) of Regulation 1/2003 justifying the re-opening of  the procedure<br>
[100] These types of concerns existed all or  in part in every merger case concerning pay-TV examined by the Commission so  far (<em>inter alia</em><em>MSG</em> in 1994, <em>Bertelsmann/Kirch</em> in 1998, <em>Sogecable/Via Digital</em> in  2003, <em>Newscorp/Telepi&ugrave;</em> in 2003)<br>
[101]   See Commission  decision of 2 April 2003, Case M.2876 <em>Newscorp/Telepiu</em>,  OJ 2004 L 110/73. The merger had originally been notified to the Italian NCA.  The transaction was abandoned and subsequently re-notified to the European  Commission which authorised the merger under conditions similar to those  envisaged by the Italian NCA<br>
[102]  As set out in  paragraphs 30, 31 of the Commission decision, due to the specificities of the  Italian market football rights are almost exclusively sold to pay-TV operators.  Therefore, a sale to free-TV operators was not a viable option.<br>

[108]  In cases where it  is foreseeable <em>ex ante</em> that all  exclusive premium rights will be acquired by a single dominant buyer or a  consortium of buyers (resulting in foreclosure), it may be appropriate to  impose on the buyer not to acquire all the rights exclusively in the same  market (<strong>no single buyer rule</strong>). In  this respect also see 3.1.3.2.5. above (no single buyer rule imposed on the  seller)<br>
[109]  Para. 233 states  that the limitation of the duration of future exclusive contracts for satellite  transmission as regards football teams to two years and the unilateral  termination right granted to football right owners constitute effective  undertakings, in that they will make premium football contents contestable on  the market at regular intervals<br>
[110]  See, <em>e.g</em>., Commission decision of 20 July  1999, Case 36888 <em>1998 Football World Cup, </em>OJ 2000 L 5/55, para. 105: &ldquo;<em>Ensuring  effective security at football matches is essential and may, in particular  circumstances, justify the implementation of special ticket sales arrangements  by tournament organisers</em>.&rdquo; Also see Commission decision of 13 December  2002, Case 37932 <em>Cupido et al v.
