It took place on Sunday morning at the ice rink of the Future Bright Amusement Park.<br /><br />14 girls came to the event organized by the Macau Ice Sports Federation. First the girls were introduced to ice hockey and its equipment before having lessons in skating, puck handling and scoring goals with two coaches and five volunteers.<br /><br />After one hour on the ice the girls watched games of Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau International Ice Hockey League.<br /><br />?The reaction from the girls is good. They told us that although they became tired, they have had fun on the ice,? said Siu Sing John Ng, Secretary General of the Macau Ice Sports Federation. ?The parents are also thinking that the volunteers did help a lot by encouraging the children during the ice session. They felt our sport is safe enough and allowed their children to join the hockey practice after the introduction of the protective equipment.?<br /><br />?Most people in Macau have the wrong perception that ice hockey is a violent sport only for tough guys. By holding this wonderful event, it may correct the misunderstanding to the public.?<br /><br />Newspapers and Macau?s broadcaster TDM reported from the event, click <a href="http://new.tdm.com.mo/c_news/tv_news.php?id=163284" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window" >here</a> for the video about the girls? day and the championship.</p></div></td>

A novice team played during the first intermission as well.<br /><br />Lastly, the Evangeline Arena in that city also drew a crowd of players and instructors.

During the second intermission, 13 of the Girls Hockey Day participants played a short exhibition game, and then greeted the Link?ping players as they took the ice for the third period. <br /><br />After the game, it was time for the participants to hit the ice. <br /><br />?We split the ice into three sections ? one where the younger girls played a 4-on-4 game against each other, another where some new girls got to practice their skating, and a third where the older girls played a 3-on-3 game,? says Eriksson. <br /><br />?We also had the women?s elite team goalie Kim Martin and defenseman Emma Holmbom come and visit our event. They talked about their careers, and then helped coach the youngest girls,? he adds. <br /><br />After a short break - for lemonade and cookies - there was some more hockey and a penalty shootout. <br /><br />?We saw lots of smiling girls, and the parents were happy too. It was also important for the girls that play hockey with boys to see that there are other girls who play hockey. The event helped to improve the contacts between them,? Eriksson says.</p></div></td>

<p>The team then hit the gym floor and were put through their paces by a top professional instructor. It was tough session, with various exercises being undertaken. During the final minutes, after sweating it out, the team had to work together in order to lift a weighted rope. With coordination and team work, the girls succeeded!</p>

They are given a tough work out by a professional instructor in preparation for the Championships. We look forward to upcoming on ice trainings as we prepare for the Championships in December.?</p>
