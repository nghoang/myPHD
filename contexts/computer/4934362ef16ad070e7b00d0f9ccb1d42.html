	<strong><font color="#000000"><u>Warning</u></font></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	<font color="#000000"><strong>HijackThis should only be used if your browser or computer is still having problems after running Spybot or another Spyware/Hijacker remover. HijackThis is an advanced tool, and therefore requires advanced knowledge about Windows and operating systems in general. If you delete items that it shows, without knowing what they are, it can lead to other problems such as your Internet no longer working or problems with running Windows itself. You should also attempt to clean the Spyware/Hijacker/Trojan with all other methods before using HijackThis. If you allow HijackThis to remove entries before another removal tool scans your computer, the files from the Hijacker/Spyware will still be left on your computer and future removal tools will not be able to find them.</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>
<p>
	<font color="#FF0000"><strong>If you do not have advanced knowledge about computers you should NOT fix entries using HijackThis without consulting an expert on using this program. If you have already run Spybot - S&amp;D and Ad-Aware and are still having problems, then please continue with this tutorial and post a HijackThis log in our <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/forum22.html">HijackThis forum</a>, including details about your problem, and we will advise you on what to fix.</strong></font></p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong><u><a name="Intro" rel="nofollow"></a>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	HijackThis is a utility that produces a listing of certain settings found in your computer. HijackThis will scan your registry and various other files for entries that are similar to what a Spyware or Hijacker program would leave behind. Interpreting these results can be tricky as there are many legitimate programs that are installed in your operating system in a similar manner that Hijackers get installed. Therefore you must use extreme caution when having HijackThis fix any problems. I can not stress how important it is to follow the above warning.</p>
<p>
	There are two prevalent tutorials about HijackThis on the Internet currently, but neither of them explain what each of the sections actually mean in a way that a layman can understand. This tutorial, in addition, to showing how to use HijackThis, will also go into detail about each of the sections and what they actually mean. There is no reason why you should not understand what it is you are fixing when people examine your logs and tell you what to do.</p>
<p>
	If you would like to first read a tutorial on how to use Spybot, you can click here: <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/using-spybot-to-remove-spyware/">How to use Spybot - Search and Destroy Tutorial</a></p>
<p>
	With that said, lets move on to the tutorial on how to use it. If you want to see normal sizes of the screen shots you can click on them. Keep in mind, that a new window will open up when you do so, so if you have pop-up blockers it may stop the image window from opening.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong><u><a name="HowToUse" rel="nofollow"></a>How to use HijackThis</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	HijackThis can be downloaded as a standalone executable or as an installer. The standalone application allows you to save and run HijackThis.exe from any folder you wish, while the installer will install HijackThis in a specific location and create desktop shortcuts to that executable. When using the standalone version you should not run it from your Temporary Internet Files folder as your backup folder will not be saved after you close the program. In order to avoid the deletion of your backups, please save the executable to a specific folder before running it. We suggest that you use the HijackThis installer as that has become the standard way of using the program and provides a safe location for HijackThis backups.</p>
<p>
	The first step is to download HijackThis to your computer in a location that you know where to find it again. HijackThis can be downloaded from the following link:</p>
<blockquote>
	<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/hijackthis/">HijackThis Download Link</a></blockquote>
<p>
	If you have downloaded the standalone application, then simply double-click on the HijackThis.exe file and then <a href="#run_hijackthis" rel="nofollow">click here</a> to skip to the part where the program has started.</p>
<p>
	Otherwise, if you downloaded the installer, navigate to the location where it was saved and double-click on the <strong>HiJackThis.msi</strong> file in order to start the installation of HijackThis. When the install starts, click on the <strong>Install</strong> button to have HijackThis installed into the <strong>C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\HijackThis</strong> folder, create a desktop shortcut that can be used to run the program when you need to, and to automatically launch HijackThis for the first time.</p>
<p>
	<a name="run_hijackthis" rel="nofollow"></a>You should now see a screen similar to the figure below:<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	<img alt="HijackThis Tutorial and Guide" border="0" src="http://www.bleepstatic.com/tutorials/hijackthis/startup-screen.jpg" /><br />
	<strong>Figure 1. HijackThis Startup screen when run for the first time</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We suggest you put a checkmark in the checkbox labeled <strong>Do not show this windows when I start HijackThis, </strong>designated by the blue arrow above, as most instructions you will given will not account for this screen. After you have put a checkmark in that checkbox, click on the <strong>None of the above, just start the program</strong> button, designated by the red arrow in the figure above. You will then be presented with the main HijackThis screen as seen in Figure 2 below.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	<img alt="HijackThis Tutorial and Guide" border="0" src="http://www.bleepstatic.com/tutorials/hijackthis/hijackthis-start.jpg" /><br />
	<strong><a id="StartingHT" name="StartingHT" rel="nofollow"></a>Figure 2. Starting Screen of Hijack This</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You should first click on the <strong>Config</strong> button, which is designated by the blue arrow in Figure 2, and confirm that your settings match those found in Figure 3 below. The options that should be checked are designated by the red arrow.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	<img alt="HijackThis Tutorial and Guide" border="0" src="http://www.bleepstatic.com/tutorials/hijackthis/hijackthis-config.jpg" /><br />
	<strong><a id="HTConfig" name="HTConfig" rel="nofollow"></a>Figure 3. HijackThis Configuration Options</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When you are done setting these options, press the <strong>back</strong> key and continue with the rest of the tutorial.</p>
<p>
	To have HijackThis scan your computer for possible Hijackers, click on the <strong>Scan</strong> button designated by the red arrow in Figure 2. You will then be presented with a screen listing all the items found by the program as seen in Figure 4.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	<img alt="HijackThis Tutorial and Guide" border="0" src="http://www.bleepstatic.com/tutorials/hijackthis/hijackthis-scan.jpg" /><br />
	<strong><a id="HTScanResults" name="HTScanResults" rel="nofollow"></a>Figure 4. Scan Results</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	At this point, you will have a listing of all items found by HijackThis.</p>
<p>
	If what you see seems confusing and daunting to you, then click on the <strong>Save Log</strong> button, designated by the red arrow, and save the log to your computer somewhere you will remember later.</p>
<p>
	To open up the log and paste it into a forum, like <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/forum22.html">ours</a>, you should following these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Click on <strong>Start</strong> then <strong>Run</strong> and type <strong>Notepad</strong> and press OK. Notepad will now be open on your computer.</li>
	<li>
		Click on <strong>File</strong> and <strong>Open</strong>, and navigate to the directory where you saved the Log file.</li>
	<li>
		When you see the file, double click on it. The log file should now be opened in your Notepad.</li>
	<li>
		Click on <strong>Edit</strong> and then <strong>Select All</strong>. All the text should now be selected.</li>
	<li>
		Click on <strong>Edit</strong> and then <strong>Copy</strong>, which will copy all the selected text into your clipboard.</li>
	<li>
		Go to the <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/forum22.html">message forum</a> and create a new message.</li>
	<li>
		Title the message: HijackThis Log: Please help Diagnose</li>
	<li>
		Right click in the message area where you would normally type your message, and click on the <strong>paste</strong> option. The previously selected text should now be in the message.</li>
	<li>
		Press <strong>Submit</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
	If you would like to see information about any of the objects listed, you can click once on a listing, and then press the &quot;<strong>Info on selected item...</strong>&quot; button. This will bring up a screen similar to Figure 5 below:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	<img alt="HijackThis Tutorial and Guide" border="0" src="http://www.bleepstatic.com/tutorials/hijackthis/hijackthis-info.jpg" /><br />
	<strong><a id="HTObjectInfo" name="HTObjectInfo" rel="nofollow"></a>Figure 5. Object Information</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When you are done looking at the information for the various listings, and you feel that you are knowledgeable enough to continue, look through the listings and select the items you would like to remove by placing checkmarks in the checkboxes next to each listing as shown in Figure 6. At the end of the document we have included some basic ways to interpret the information in these log files. By no means is this information extensive enough to cover all decisions, but should help you determine what is legitimate or not.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
	<img alt="HijackThis Tutorial and Guide" border="0" src="http://www.bleepstatic.com/tutorials/hijackthis/hijackthis-select.jpg" /><br />
	<strong><a id="HTItemRemove" name="HTItemRemove" rel="nofollow"></a>Figure 6. Select an item to Remove</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Once you have selected the items you would like to remove, press the <strong>Fix Checked</strong> button, designated by the blue arrow, in Figure 6. HijackThis will then prompt you to confirm if you would like to remove those items. Press <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong> depending on your choice.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u><a id="HTRestore" name="HTRestore" rel="nofollow"></a>How to restore items mistakenly deleted</u></strong></p>
<p>
	HijackThis comes with a backup and restore procedure in the event that you erroneously remove an entry that is actually legitimate. If you have configured HijackThis as was shown in this tutorial, then you should be able to restore entries that you have previously deleted. If you have had your HijackThis program running from a temporary directory, then the restore procedure will not work.</p>
<p>
	If the configuration setting <strong>Make backups before fixing items</strong> is checked, HijackThis will make a backup of any entries that you fix in a directory called <strong>backups </strong>that resides in the same location as Hijackthis.exe.</p>
<p>
	If you start HijackThis and click on <strong>Config</strong>, and then the <strong>Backup</strong> button you will be presented with a screen like Figure 7 below. You will have a listing of all the items that you had fixed previously and have the option of restoring them. Once you restore an item that is listed in this screen, upon scanning again with HijackThis, the entries will show up again.</p>

	<strong><u><a id="HTStartupList" name="HTStartupList" rel="nofollow"></a>How to Generate a Startup Listing</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	At times when you post your log to a message forum asking for assistance, the people helping may ask you to generate a listing of all the programs that automatically start on your computer. HijackThis has a built in tool that will allow you to do this.</p>
<p>
	In order to do this go into the <strong>Config</strong> option when you start HijackThis, which is designated by the blue arrow in Figure 2, and then click on the <strong>Misc Tools</strong> button at the top. You should see a screen similar to Figure 8 below.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>Figure 8. Generating a StartupList Log.</strong></p>
<p align="center">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You will then click on the button labeled <strong>Generate StartupList Log</strong> which is is designated by the red arrow in Figure 8. Once you click that button, the program will automatically open up a notepad filled with the Startup items from your computer. Copy and paste these entries into a message and submit it.</p>
<p>
	Hopefully with either your knowledge or help from others you will have cleaned up your computer. If you would like to learn more detailed information about what exactly each section in a scan log means, then continue reading.</p>

	<strong><u><a id="HTProcessManager" name="HTProcessManager" rel="nofollow"></a>How to use the Process Manager</u></strong></p>
<p>
	HijackThis has a built in process manager that can be used to end processes as well as see what DLLs are loaded in that process. To access the process manager, you should click on the <strong>Config</strong> button and then click on the <strong>Misc Tools</strong> button. You should now see a new screen with one of the buttons being <strong>Open Process Manager</strong>. If you click on that button you will see a new screen similar to Figure 9 below.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

	<strong>Figure 9. HijackThis Process Manager</strong></p>
<p align="center">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This window will list all open processes running on your machine. You can then click once on a process to select it, and then click on the <strong>Kill Process</strong> button designated by the red arrow in Figure 9 above. This will attempt to end the process running on the computer.</p>
<p>
	If you would like to terminate multiple processes at the same time, press and hold down the <strong>control</strong> key on your keyboard. While that key is pressed, click once on each process that you want to be terminated. As long as you hold down the <strong>control</strong> button while selecting the additional processes, you will be able to select multiple processes at one time. When you have selected all the processes you would like to terminate you would then press the <strong>Kill Process </strong>button.</p>
<p>
	If you would like to see what DLLs are loaded in a selected process, you can put a checkmark in the checkbox labeled Show DLLs, designated by the blue arrow in the figure above. This will split the process screen into two sections. The first section will list the processes like before, but now when you click on a particular process, the bottom section will list the DLLs loaded in that process.</p>
<p>
	To exit the process manager you need to click on the <strong>back</strong> button twice which will place you at the main screen.</p>

	<strong><u><a id="HTHostsManager" name="HTHostsManager" rel="nofollow"></a>How to use the Hosts File Manager</u></strong></p>
<p>
	HijackThis also has a rudimentary Hosts file manager. With this manager you can view your hosts file and delete lines in the file or toggle lines on or off. To access the Hosts file manager, you should click on the Config button and then click on the Misc Tools button. You should now see a new screen with one of the buttons being Hosts File Manager. If you click on that button you will see a new screen similar to Figure 10 below.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">

	<strong>Figure 10: Hosts File Manager</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This window will list the contents of your HOSTS file. To delete a line in your hosts file you would click on a line like the one designated by the blue arrow in Figure 10 above. This will select that line of text. Then you can either delete the line, by clicking on the Delete line(s) button, or toggle the line on or off, by clicking on the Toggle line(s) button. It is possible to select multiple lines at once using the shift and control keys or dragging your mouse over the lines you would like to interact with.</p>
<p>
	If you delete the lines, those lines will be deleted from your HOSTS file. If you toggle the lines, HijackThis will add a # sign in front of the line. This will comment out the line so that it will not be used by Windows. If you are unsure as to what to do, it is always safe to Toggle the line so that a # appears before it.</p>
<p>
	To exit the Hosts file manager you need to click on the <strong>back</strong> button twice which will place you at the main screen.</p>

<p>
	At times you may find a file that stubbornly refuses to be deleted by conventional means. HijackThis introduced, in version 1.98.2, a method to have Windows delete the file as it boots up, before the file has the chance to load. To do this follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Start Hijackthis</li>
	<li>
		Click on the <strong>Config</strong> button</li>
	<li>
		Click on the <strong>Misc Tools</strong> button</li>
	<li>
		Click on the button labeled<strong> Delete a file on reboot...</strong></li>
	<li>
		A new window will open asking you to select the file that you would like to delete on reboot. Navigate to the file and click on it once, and then click on the <strong>Open</strong> button.</li>
	<li>
		You will now be asked if you would like to reboot your computer to delete the file. Click on the <strong>Yes</strong> button if you would like to reboot now, otherwise click on the <strong>No</strong> button to reboot later.</li>

	<strong><u><a id="adsspy" name="adsspy" rel="nofollow"></a>How to use ADS Spy</u></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There is a particular infection called Home Search Assistant or CWS_NS3 that will sometimes use a file called an <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-alternate-data-streams/">Alternate Data Stream File</a> to infect your computer. These files can not be seen or deleted using normal methods. ADS Spy was designed to help in removing these types of files. For those who are interested, you can learn more about Alternate Data Streams and the Home Search Assistant by reading the following articles:</p>
<p>
	<strong><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-alternate-data-streams/"><font color="#FF0000">Windows Alternate Data Streams</font></a> [Tutorial Link]</strong></p>

<p>
	<br />
	To use the ADS Spy utility you would start HijackThis and then click on the <strong>Config</strong> button. Then click on the <strong>Misc Tools</strong> button and finally click on the<strong> ADS Spy </strong>button. When the ADS Spy utility opens you will see a screen similar to figure 11 below.</p>

	<strong><u><a id="uniman" name="uniman" rel="nofollow"></a>How to use the Uninstall Manager</u></strong></p>
<p>
	The Uninstall Manager allows you to manage the entries found in your control panel&#39;s Add/Remove Programs list. When cleaning malware from a machine entries in the Add/Remove Programs list invariably get left behind. Many users understandably like to have a clean Add/Remove Programs list and have difficulty removing these errant entries. Using the Uninstall Manager you can remove these entries from your uninstall list.</p>
<p>
	To access the Uninstall Manager you would do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Start HijackThis</li>
	<li>
		Click on the <strong>Config</strong> button</li>
	<li>
		Click on the <strong>Misc Tools</strong> button</li>

	To delete<strong> </strong>an entry simply click on the entry you would like to remove and then click on the <strong>Delete this entry </strong>button. If you want to change the program this entry is associated with you can click on the <strong>Edit uninstall command</strong> button and enter the path to the program that should be run if you double-click on that entry in the <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> list. This last function should only be used if you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>
	If you are asked to save this list and post it so someone can examine it and advise you as to what you should remove, you can click on the <strong>Save list...</strong> button and specify where you would like to save this file. When you press <strong>Save </strong> button a notepad will open with the contents of that file.

	A common question is what does it mean when the word Obfuscated is next to one of these entries. When something is obfuscated that means that it is being made difficult to perceive or understand. In Spyware terms that means the Spyware or Hijacker is hiding an entry it made by converting the values into some other form that it understands easily, but humans would have trouble recognizing, such as adding entries into the registry in Hexadecimal. This is just another method of hiding its presence and making it difficult to be removed.</p>
<p>
	If you do not recognize the web site that either R0 and R1 are pointing to, and you want to change it, then you can have HijackThis safely fix these, as they will not be detrimental to your Internet Explorer install. If you would like to see what sites they are, you can go to the site, and if it&#39;s a lot of popups and links, you can almost always delete it. It is important to note that if an RO/R1 points to a file, and you fix the entry with HijackThis, Hijackthis will not delete that particular file and you will have to do it manually.</p>
<p>
	There are certain R3 entries that end with a underscore ( _ ) . An example of what one would look like is:</p>
<p>
	<strong>R3 - URLSearchHook: (no name) - {CFBFAE00-17A6-11D0-99CB-00C04FD64497}_ - (no file)</strong></p>
<p>
	Notice the CLSID, the numbers between the { }, have a _ at the end of it and they may sometimes difficult to remove with HijackThis. To fix this you will need to delete the particular registry entry manually by going to the following key:</p>
<p>
	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\URLSearchHooks</p>
<p>
	Then delete the CLSID entry under it that you would like to remove. Please leave the CLSID , CFBFAE00-17A6-11D0-99CB-00C04FD64497, as it is the valid default one.</p>
<p>
	Unless you recognize the software being used as the UrlSearchHook, you should generally Google it and after doing some research, allow HijackThis to fix it</p>

	<strong><a id="FDiag" name="FDiag" rel="nofollow"></a><u>F0, F1, F2, F3 Sections</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	These sections cover applications that are loaded from your .INI files, system.ini and win.ini, in Windows ME and below or their equivalent places in the registry for Windows NT based versions. The Windows NT based versions are XP, 2000, 2003, and Vista.</p>
<p>
	A F0 entry corresponds to the <strong>Shell=</strong> statement, under the <strong>[Boot]</strong> section, of the System.ini file. The <strong>Shell=</strong> statement in the system.ini file is used to designate what program would act as the shell for the operating system.</p>
<table border="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
			<td width="14%">

			<td>
				<strong>Files Used:</strong></td>
			<td>
				c:\windows\system.ini</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	The Shell is the program that would load your desktop, handle window management, and allow the user to interact with the system. Any program listed after the shell statement will be loaded when Windows starts, and act as the default shell. There were some programs that acted as valid shell replacements, but they are generally no longer used. Windows 95, 98, and ME all used Explorer.exe as their shell by default. Windows 3.X used Progman.exe as its shell. It is also possible to list other programs that will launch as Windows loads in the same Shell = line, such as Shell=explorer.exe badprogram.exe. This line will make both programs start when Windows loads.</p>
<p>
	A F1 entry corresponds to the <strong>Run=</strong> or <strong>Load=</strong> entry in the win.ini file. Like the system.ini file, the win.ini file is typically only used in Windows ME and below.</p>
<table border="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
			<td width="14%">
				<b>Example Listing</b></td>

<p>
	Any programs listed after the run= or load= will load when Windows starts. This run= statement was used during the Windows 3.1, 95, and 98 years and is kept for backwards compatibility with older programs. Most modern programs do not use this ini setting, and if you do not use older program you can rightfully be suspicious. The load= statement was used to load drivers for your hardware. On Windows NT based systems (Windows 2000, XP, etc) HijackThis will show the entries found in win.ini and system.ini, but Windows NT based systems will not execute the files listed there.</p>
<p>
	F2 and F3 entries correspond to the equivalent locations as F0 and F1, but they are instead stored in the registry for Windows versions XP, 2000, and NT. These versions of Windows do not use the system.ini and win.ini files. Instead for backwards compatibility they use a function called IniFileMapping. IniFileMapping, puts all of the contents of an .ini file in the registry, with keys for each line found in the .ini key stored there. Then when you run a program that normally reads their settings from an .ini file, it will first check the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMapping for an .ini mapping, and if found will read the settings from there instead. You can see that these entries, in the examples below, are referring to the registry as it will contain REG and then the .ini file which IniFileMapping is referring to.</p>
<p>
	F2 entries are displayed when there is a value that is not whitelisted, or considered safe, in the registry key<strong> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon </strong>under the values <strong>Shell</strong> and <strong>Userinit</strong>.</p>

	The Shell registry value is equivalent to the function of the <strong>Shell=</strong> in the system.ini file as described above. The <strong>Userinit</strong> value specifies what program should be launched right after a user logs into Windows. The default program for this key is C:\windows\system32\userinit.exe. Userinit.exe is a program that restores your profile, fonts, colors, etc for your username. It is possible to add further programs that will launch from this key by separating the programs with a comma. For example: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit =C:\windows\system32\userinit.exe,c:\windows\badprogram.exe. This will make both programs launch when you log in and is a common place for trojans, hijackers, and spyware to launch from. It should be noted that the <strong>Userinit</strong> and the <strong>Shell</strong> F2 entries will not show in HijackThis unless there is a non-whitelisted value listed.</p>
<p>
	F3 entries are displayed when there is a value that is not whitelisted in the registry key <strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</strong> under the values <strong>load</strong> and <strong>run</strong>.<strong> </strong>These entries are the Windows NT equivalent of those found in the F1 entries as described above.</p>

	For F0 if you see a statement like Shell=Explorer.exe something.exe, then you can generally delete it, but you should first consult Google and the sites listed below.</p>
<p>
	For F1 entries you should google the entries found here to determine if they are legitimate programs. You can also search at the sites below for the entry to see what it does.</p>
<p>
	For F2, if you see UserInit=userinit.exe, with or without nddeagnt.exe, as in the above example, then you can leave that entry alone. If you see UserInit=userinit.exe (notice no comma) that is still ok, so you should leave it alone. If you see another entry with userinit.exe, then that could potentially be a trojan or other malware. The same goes for F2 Shell=; if you see explorer.exe by itself, it should be fine, if you don&#39;t, as in the above example listing, then it could be a potential trojan or malware. You can generally delete these entries, but you should consult Google and the sites listed below.</p>
<p>
	Please be aware that when these entries are fixed HijackThis does not delete the file associated with it. You must manually delete these files.</p>

	This section corresponds to Host file Redirection.</p>
<p>
	The hosts file contains mappings for hostnames to IP addresses.For example, if I enter in my host file:</p>
<p>
	<strong>127.0.0.1 www.bleepingcomputer.com</strong></p>
<p>
	and you try to go to www.bleepingcomputer.com, it will check the hosts file, see the entry and convert that to the IP address of 127.0.0.1 instead of its correct address.</p>
<p>
	Host file redirection is when a hijacker changes your hosts file to redirect your attempts to reach a certain web site to another site. So if someone added an entry like:</p>
<p>
	<strong>127.0.0.1 www.google.com</strong></p>
<p>
	and you tried to go to www.google.com, you would instead get redirected to 127.0.0.1 which is your own computer.</p>

<p>
	<br />
	This section corresponds to certain registry keys and startup folders that are used to automatically start an application when Windows starts. O4 keys are the HJT entries that the majority of programs use to autostart, so particular care must be used when examining these keys. The O4 Registry keys and directory locations are listed below and apply, for the most part, to all versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
	As of HijackThis version 2.0, HijackThis will also list entries for other users that are actively logged into a computer at the time of the scan by reading the information from the HKEY_USERS registry key. If a user is not logged on at the time of the scan, their user key will not be loaded, and therefore HijackThis will not list their autoruns. When working on HijackThis logs it is not advised to use HijackThis to fix entries in a person&#39;s log when the user has multiple accounts logged in. We advise this because the other user&#39;s processes may conflict with the fixes we are having the user run.</p>
<p>
	The current locations that O4 entries are listed from are:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Directory Locations:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		<strong>User&#39;s Startup Folder</strong>: Any files located in a user&#39;s Start Menu Startup folder will be listed as a <font color="#0000FF">O4 - Startup</font>. This location, for the newer versions of Windows, are <font color="#0000FF">C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</font> or under <font color="#0000FF">C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</font> in Vista<strong>. </strong>These entries will be executed when the particular user logs onto the computer.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>All Users Startup Folder</strong>: These items refer to applications that load by having them in the All Users profile Start Menu Startup Folder and will be listed as <font color="#0000FF">O4 - Global Startup</font>. This location, for the newer versions of Windows, are <font color="#0000FF">C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</font> or under<font color="#0000FF"> C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup </font>in Vista<strong>.</strong> These entries will be executed when any user logs onto the computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	<strong>Startup Registry Keys: </strong>O4 entries that utilize registry keys will start with the abbreviated registry key in the entry listing. Examples and their descriptions can be seen below. For all of the keys below, if the key is located under HKCU, then that means the program will only be launched when that particular user logs on to the computer. If the entry is located under HKLM, then the program will be launched for all users that log on to the computer.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note: In the listing below, HKLM stands for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKCU stands for HKEY_CURRENT_USER.</strong></p>
<p>
	The <strong>Run</strong> keys are used to launch a program automatically when a user, or all users, logs on to the machine.</p>

<p>
	Looking at the examples above, we see 5 different startup entries, with 2 of them being for users who are logged on in the background. If an entry starts with a long series of numbers and contains a username surrounded by parenthesis at the end, then this is a O4 entry for a user logged on in the background. Let&#39;s break down the examples one by one.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>04 - HKLM\..\Run: [nwiz] nwiz.exe /install </strong>- This entry corresponds to a startup launching from <font color="#0000FF">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</font> for the currently logged in user. The name of the Registry value is <font color="#0000FF">nwiz</font> and when the entry is started it will launch the <font color="#0000FF">nwiz.exe /install</font> command.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>O4 - Global Startup: Adobe Reader Speed Launch.lnk = D:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 7.0\Reader\reader_sl.exe - </strong>This entry corresponds to a program started by the All Users Startup Folder located at <font color="#0000FF">C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</font><strong>. </strong><br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>O4 - HKLM\..\Policies\Explorer\Run: [user32.dll] C:\Program Files\Video ActiveX Access\iesmn.exe</strong> - This entry corresponds to a value located under the <font color="#0000FF">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run</font> key. The name of the Registry value is <font color="#0000FF">user32.dll </font>and its data is <font color="#0000FF">C:\Program Files\Video ActiveX Access\iesmn.exe</font>. This particular example happens to be malware related.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>O4 - S-1-5-21-1222272861-2000431354-1005 Startup: numlock.vbs (User &#39;BleepingComputer.com&#39;) - </strong>This particular entry is a little different. As you can see there is a long series of numbers before and it states at the end of the entry the user it belongs to. Those numbers in the beginning are the user&#39;s SID, or security identifier, and is a number that is unique to each user on your computer. This SID translates to the BleepingComputer.com Windows user as shown at the end of the entry. The rest of the entry is the same as a normal one, with the program being launched from a user&#39;s Start Menu Startup folder and the program being launched is <font color="#0000FF">numlock.vbs</font>.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		<strong>O4 - HKUS\S-1-5-21-1222272861-2000431354-1005\..\Run: [Windows Defender] &quot;C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe&quot; -hide (User &#39;BleepingComputer.com&#39;) </strong> - This type of entry is similar to the first example, except that it belongs to the BleepingComputer.com user. This is just another example of HijackThis listing other logged in user&#39;s autostart entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Now that we know how to interpret the entries, let&#39;s learn how to fix them. When you fix O4 entries, Hijackthis will not delete the files associated with the entry. Instead, you must delete these manually afterwards, usually by having the user first reboot into safe mode. The Global Startup and Startup entries work a little differently. HijackThis will delete the shortcuts found in these entries, but not the file they are pointing to. If an actual executable resides in the Global Startup or Startup directories then the offending file <strong>WILL </strong> be deleted.</p>
<p>
	When examining O4 entries and trying to determine what they are for you should consult one of the following lists:</p>

	Internet Explorer&#39;s security is based upon a set of zones. Each zone has different security in terms of what scripts and applications can be run from a site that is in that zone. There is a security zone called the Trusted Zone. This zone has the lowest security and allows scripts and applications from sites in this zone to run without your knowledge. It is therefore a popular setting for malware sites to use so that future infections can be easily done on your computer without your knowledge as these sites will be in the Trusted Zone..</p>

	Which key, Domains or Ranges, is used by Internet Explorer is determined by the URL that the user is trying to reach. If the URL contains a domain name then it will search in the Domains subkeys for a match. If it contains an IP address it will search the Ranges subkeys for a match. When domains are added as a Trusted Site or Restricted they are assigned a value to signify that. If they are assigned a <strong>*=4</strong> value, that domain will be entered into the Restricted Sites zone. If they are given a <strong>*=2</strong> value, then that domain will be added to the Trusted Sites zone.</p>
<p>
	Adding an IP address works a bit differently. Under the SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\Ranges key you may find other keys called Ranges1, Ranges2, Ranges3, Ranges4,... Each of these subkeys correspond to a particular security zone/protocol. If you add an IP address to a security zone, Windows will create a subkey starting with Ranges1 and designate that subkey as the one that will contain all IP addresses of a particular security zone for a particular protocol. For example, if you added http://192.168.1.1 as a trusted sites, Windows would create the first available Ranges key (Ranges1) and add a value of http=2. Any future trusted http:// IP addresses will be added to the Range1 key. Now if you added an IP address to the Restricted sites using the http protocol (ie. http://192.16.1.10), Windows would create another key in sequential order, called Range2. This would have a value of http=4 and any future IP addresses added to the restricted sites will be placed in that key. This continues on for each protocol and security zone setting combination.</p>
<p>
	If you ever see any domains or IP addresses listed here you should generally remove it unless it is a recognizable URL such as one your company uses. The most common listing you will find here are free.aol.com which you can have fixed if you want. I personally remove all entries from the Trusted Zone as they are ultimately unnecessary to be there.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>ProtocolDefaults</strong></p>
<p>
	When you use IE to connect to a site, the security permissions that are granted to that site are determined by the Zone it is in. There are 5 zones with each being associated with a specific identifying number. These zones with their associated numbers are:</p>

	Each of the protocols that you use to connect to a site, such as HTTP, FTP, HTTPS, are then mapped to a one of these zones. The following are the default mappings:</p>

	For example, if you connect to a site using the http:// it will be part of the Internet zone by default. This is because the default zone for http is 3 which corresponds to the Internet zone. The problem arises if a malware changes the default zone type of a particular protocol. For example, if a malware has changed the default zone for the HTTP protocol to 2, then any site you connect to using http will now be considered part of the Trusted zone. As of now there are no known malware that causes this, but we may see differently now that HJT is enumerating this key.</p>

	When you go to a web site using an hostname, like www.bleepingcomputer.com, instead of an IP address, your computer uses a DNS server to resolve the hostname into an IP address like 192.168.1.0. Domain hacks are when the Hijacker changes the DNS servers on your machine to point to their own server, where they can direct you to any site they want. By adding google.com to their DNS server, they can make it so that when you go to www.google.com, they redirect you to a site of their choice.</p>

	This section corresponds to files being loaded through the AppInit_DLLs Registry value and the Winlogon Notify Subkeys</p>
<p>
	The AppInit_DLLs registry value contains a list of dlls that will be loaded when user32.dll is loaded. As most Windows executables use the user32.dll, that means that any DLL that is listed in the AppInit_DLLs registry key will be loaded also. This makes it very difficult to remove the DLL as it will be loaded within multiple processes, some of which can not be stopped without causing system instability. The user32.dll file is also used by processes that are automatically started by the system when you log on. This means that the files loaded in the AppInit_DLLs value will be loaded very early in the Windows startup routine allowing the DLL to hide itself or protect itself before we have access to the system.</p>
<p>
	This method is known to be used by a CoolWebSearch variant and can only be seen in Regedit by right-clicking on the value, and selecting Modify binary data. <a href="http://www.resplendence.com/reglite" rel="nofollow">Registrar Lite</a>, on the other hand, has an easier time seeing this DLL.</p>

	There are very few legitimate programs that use this Registry key, but you should proceed with caution when deleting files that are listed here. Use our <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/startups/"><b>Bleeping Computer Startup Database</b></a> or <a href="http://www.systemlookup.com/lists.php" rel="nofollow">SystemLookup.com</a> to help verify files.<br />
	<br />
	When you fix these types of entries, HijackThis will not delete the offending file listed. It is recommended that you reboot into safe mode and delete the offending file.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Winlogon Notify</strong><br />
	<br />
	The Winlogon Notify key is generally used by Look2Me infections. HijackThis will list all Winlogon Notify keys that are non-standard so that you can easily spot one that does not belong. You can recognize the Look2Me infection key as it will have a DLL with a random filename located in the %SYSTEM% directory. The name of the Notify key will have a normal looking name even though it does not belong there.</p>

<p>
	<br />
	This section corresponds to files being loaded through the ShellServiceObjectDelayLoad registry key.</p>
<p>
	This Registry contains values in a similar way as the Run key does. The difference is that instead of pointing to the file itself, it points to the CLSID&#39;s InProcServer, which contains the information about the particular DLL file that is being used.</p>
<p>
	The files under this key are loaded automatically by Explorer.exe when your computer starts. Because Explorer.exe is the shell for your computer, it will always start, thus always loading the files under this key. These files are therefore loaded early in the startup process before any human intervention occurs.</p>
<p>
	A hijacker that uses the method can be recognized by the following entries:</p>
<table border="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" width="90%">

<p>
	HijackThis uses an internal white list to not show common legitimate entries under this key. If you do see a listing for this, then it is not a standard one and should be considered suspicious. Use our <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/startups/"><b>Bleeping Computer Startup Database</b></a> or <a href="http://www.systemlookup.com/lists.php" rel="nofollow">SystemLookup.com</a> to help verify files.<br />

	Be carefully when removing items listed in these keys as some are legitimate. Your can use google to see if you can determine if it is a valid.

<p>
	Hijackthis will delete the SharedTaskScheduler value associated with this entry, but will not delete the CLSID that it points to and the file that the CSLID&#39;s Inprocserver32 points to. Therefore you should always have the user reboot into safe mode and manually delete this file.</p>

	<br />
	This section corresponds to XP,NT, 2003, and 2003 services.</p>
<p>
	Services are programs that are loaded automatically by Windows on startup. These services are loaded regardless of whether or not a user logs on to the the computer and tend to be used to handle system wide tasks such as Windows operating system features, antivirus software, or application servers. Lately there has been an increased trend for malware to use services to infect a computer. It is therefore important to examine each of the services listed for ones that do not look correct. Common malware services you may find are Home Search Assistant and the new Bargain Buddy variant. Examples of lines associated with those infections can be found below.</p>
<p>
	The majority of the Microsoft services have been added to the white list so they will not be listed. If you would like to see these services you can start HijackThis with the /ihatewhitelists flag.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Legitimate Service</strong> <strong>Example:</strong></p>
<br />
<table border="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" width="96%">

<table border="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" width="96%">
	<tbody>
		<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
			<td width="13%">
				Example Listing</td>
			<td width="87%">
				O23 - Service: Workstation NetLogon Service - Unknown - C:\WINDOWS\system32\crxu.exe</td>

				&nbsp;</td>
			<td>
				O23 - Service: ISEXEng - Unknown - C:\WINDOWS\System32\angelex.exe</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	<br />
	When you fix a O23 entry Hijackthis will change the startup for this service to disabled, stop the service, and then ask the user to reboot. It will not delete the actual service from the registry or the file it points to. In order to delete the service you will need to know the service name. This name is the text between the parenthesis. If the display name is the same as the service name, then it will not list the service name.</p>
<p>
	There are three methods you can use to delete the service key:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Delete it using XP&#39;s SC command you would type the following from a command prompt:<br />
		<br />
		<strong>sc delete servicename</strong><br />
		<br />
		To delete the service using a registry file you can use the following example:<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Use a registry file to delete a service. The below registry file is an example of how to remove Angelex.exe Bargain buddy variant:<br />

	</li>
	<li>
		Use HijackThis to delete the service. You can click on <strong>Config</strong>, then<strong> Misc Tools</strong>, and then press the <strong>Delete an NT service.. </strong>button. When it opens you should then enter the service name and press <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

<p>
	This section corresponds to Windows Active Desktop Components.</p>
<p>
	Active Desktop Components are local or remote html files that are embedded directly onto your desktop as a background. Infections use this method to embed messages, pictures, or web pages directly on to a users desktop. Common examples of infections that use this method are the SmitFraud family of rogue anti-spyware programs. These infections use Active Desktop Components to display fake security warnings as the background of a user&#39;s desktop. Other infections that use this method can be found at the following links:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>

</blockquote>
<p>
	The registry key associated with Active Desktop Components is:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Registry Key</strong>: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Desktop\Components</p>
<p>
	Each specific component is then listed as a numeric subkey of the above Key starting with the number 0. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Desktop\Components\0\<br />
		HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Desktop\Components\1\<br />
		HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Desktop\Components\2\</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Example listings of Desktop Component entries used by SmitFraud variants are:</p>
<table border="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" width="96%">
	<tbody>
		<tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
			<td width="16%">
				<strong>Example Listing</strong></td>
			<td width="84%">
				<p>
					O24 - Desktop Component 0: (Security) - %windir%\index.html<br />
					O24 - Desktop Component 1: (no name) - %Windir%\warnhp.html</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	As it is possible someone has purposely configured an Active Desktop Component, if you see one that is unfamiliar it is advised that you ask the user if they purposely added it.</p>
<p>
	When fixing these entries, HijackThis will only remove the Desktop Component in the registry. The actual HTML file being referenced, though, will not be deleted. Therefore, if the component is malware related you should manually delete this file.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u><a name="conc" rel="nofollow"></a>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	HijackThis is a very powerful tool for finding out the specifics of your browser and what is running in Windows. Unfortunately, diagnosing the scan results of HijackThis can be complicated. Hopefully my recommendations and explanations will ease the way somewhat. This program, though, is to be used with caution, as incorrectly removing some items can cause problems with legitimate programs.
