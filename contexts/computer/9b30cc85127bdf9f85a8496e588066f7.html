				<div class="sidebar-title"><h2>&nbsp; School and Career Overview</h2></div><div class="block-wrapper"><h3>Degrees and Schools</h3>

<p>Knowledge of programming languages is a fundamental skill for computer programmers. The more in-demand programming languages a programmer knows, the more in-demand he or she will be to employers. Having a solid arsenal of desired programming languages, experience as a programmer, and a portfolio of developed products are considered the most desirable qualifications in job candidates. </p>

<p>Most computer programmers obtain these skills through two-year associate's degree or four-year bachelor's degree programs offered through vocational schools, colleges and universities. However, many companies require a bachelor's degree to be considered for any professional position, and many jobs are filled through college recruiting. Therefore, approximately 70% of computer programmers have a bachelor's degree or higher. Preferred degrees include computer science, information technology, mathematics and engineering. Programmers who also have training in business or project management are considered prime candidates.</p>
  
<p>Clearly-defined career goals are important for programmers, because what they learn directly determines what they can create. For example, if a student wants to develop games, he or she will need different languages and skill sets than a student who wants to create information security programs to defend against hackers. Therefore students will want to choose courses carefully for how relevant the studies are towards specific career objectives.</p>
  
<p>Many programmers attend courses, test for certifications, attend conferences and belong to programming groups as part of their work.  It is common that expenses for these activities are reimbursed by employers.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>Two-year and four-year degree programs often require a combination of class time and lab time, where students apply what they are learning by creating actual programs or participating in group projects. Coursework usually include the study of:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Computer hardware and how it is controlled by the operating system.</li>
  <li>Different operating systems and how to manipulate settings to achieve a customized result.</li>
  <li>Internet and networking technologies involved in the transferring of data.</li>
  <li>Website design and development.</li>
  <li>Database design theory and structure.</li>
  <li>Backup and recovery devices, software and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Usability for designing products that users can work with easily.</li>
  <li>Information architecture for how to store data efficiently.</li>
  <li>Programming languages and theory.</li>
  <li>Working with requirements.</li>
  <li>Quality control and testing.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Continued education is essential for programmers to remain up-to-date on emerging technologies. Certificate courses for a particular technology, product or programming language are often used as a way of furthering skill sets, and are available online, through colleges and universities, or sometimes through employers. </p>

<h3>Online Classes and Programs</h3>

<p>Because of the common use of telecommuting among programmers, obtaining an online information technology or computer science two-year degree or four-year degree is often preferred over attending on-campus classes. Choosing educational programs that are accredited by organizations such as the <a href="http://www.csab.org/" target="_blank">Computer Science Accreditation Commission (CSAC)</a> ensures that credits will be accepted at other schools in the future, and can help narrow down which program is the best match.</p>
  
<h3>Employment Requirements</h3>

<p>Requirements for programming jobs are specific to the kind of development being done, and the languages, software and technology being used. Although bachelor's degrees are considered desirable, and may be required by some employers, demonstrated ability in the form of a portfolio, certifications or work experience may suffice as a minimum requirement for some jobs.</p>

<h3>How to Evaluate Computer Programming Schools</h3>

<p>Aspiring programmers should ask the following questions when evaluating two- and four-year degree programs: </p>

<p>

<h3>Computer Programmer Job Description</h3>

<p>Designers of software, websites, databases and other technologies rely on programmers to make their vision come to life. Knowledge of programming languages, well-developed logical skill and creative problem-solving allow computer programmers to develop computer-based products -- controlling their structure, appearance and functionality. The instructions they write using programming languages like COBOL, C++ or Java command computers to perform in a desired way to achieve a measurable result. </p>

<p>The duties of computer programmers can typically include:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Working with designers and analysts to conceptualize a realistic product or a specific setup among computers and networks.</li>
  <li>Following detailed instructions provided by designers and analysts to produce the final product or system.</li>
  <li>Testing their work product according to specifications and debugging errors.</li>
  <li>Using or inventing program tools with which they create components or fix problems.</li>
  <li>Expanding, updating and repairing existing products.</li>
  <li>Documenting the purpose of code within the code for other programmers.</li>
  <li>Communicating time estimates and actual time to finish programming work to project managers.</li>
  <li>Managing different projects at one time.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Some programmers are involved in a project from start to finish and use different languages and technologies to create the final deliverables. Others are part of a team and create specific pieces of the whole. Application programmers specialize in writing task-oriented programs, while systems programmers use code to establish and maintain systems within organizations.</p>

<p>Computer programmers work in office environments, either on site or telecommuting, as full time employees or frequently as self-employed consultants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

<tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Rating</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td>School Rating</td><td>5</td><td>UTK's computer science course offerings were very theoretically-oriented.  Had I not had the background I did before I entered my program, I would have been woefully unprepared to enter the job market at graduation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opportunity for Promotion</td><td>7</td><td>At my current employer I probably won't be able to get a promotion until someone leaves, but in general there's a fair bit of upward mobility in this career field.  If my career would've happened out to have involved less legacy programming work and more work in a hotter area, I'd probably have more mobility.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Security</td><td>4</td><td>The kind of work I do is constantly at risk of being outsourced to India or China.  I do my best to emphasize the people aspects of my work in hopes that, if my company does start outsourcing coding positions, I can keep safe.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Earnings Potential</td><td>7</td><td>The market isn't as good as it used to be and certainly isn't as strong as it was when I entered my program.  I don't feel as safe as I'd like to in my current job, but I'm reasonably certain I could find work again if I had to look for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>3</td><td>The hours can be very long sometimes, but my employer is very good about granting us comp time (as I said previously).  People who work in game programming houses tend to have very grueling "crunch" hours that I don't personally have to deal with. If I did, I would likely rate this job as massively more stressful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>8</td><td>There's almost always a surprise or two waiting in the shadows on an on-call week.  That said, the work tends to be fairly similar but involves moving around from project to project a lot.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>4</td><td>Game programming in general is much cooler than the work I do.  My particular employer is pretty stuffy and corporate, but programming work especially, at indie houses and places like that, can be very exciting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>9</td><td>The hours are amazingly flexible and my particular employer is very good about giving comp time for overtime and minimizes off-the-clock work.  Not everyone can say the same, however.  My employer doesn't offer a work-from-home program except in case of emergency, but in general that's something that's readily available in my field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>3</td><td>This career path is not for social butterflies!  I do my best to incorporate interacting with our end-users in my job and serve as an informal liaison of sorts, but by and large this is extremely solitary work.</td></tr>

We also have to support live applications, and when they break, they must be debugged and fixed sometimes within an hour or less.</td></tr>

<tr><td>School Rating</td><td>9</td><td>The staff at the Harrisburg satellite campus were of a high caliber.  They had a willingness to help students understand tough concepts and at the same time always pushed students by challenging them with a tougher curriculum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opportunity for Promotion</td><td>6</td><td>There is no room for promotion at the company at this point. I've reached the highest obtainable position for my field within the company.  At a larger company this would not be a problem, because positions in IT are usually tiered pretty well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Security</td><td>9</td><td>I work in a health care software company, so the job security is very high in terms of the market. I've also become an indispensable part of the company by solving many tough problems that others could not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Earnings Potential</td><td>10</td><td>This is one of the highest paid careers in the job market today.  The pay range is probably one of the broadest as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>9</td><td>Due to the overtime that most jobs in this career require, it becomes very stressful.  This coincides with deadlines that are seemingly impossible at times due to the nature of running into many 'cutting the gordian knot' type problems, i.e. no matter how easy the end solution to a problem is, many times the length of time it takes to solve the problem is a high stress point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>7</td><td>In essence, you're always doing programming of some sort.  However, the essence of programming requires the person to be very flexible and able to adapt to varying situations for which development tasks are required.  Programming software to track race car stats versus software to chart clinical home-care visits is vastly different.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>8</td><td>This career is great if you are a true 'nerdist,' meaning you have a natural burning desire to discover the complete inner workings of anything.  It is challenging, but there within lies the beauty that you are constantly presented with new concepts to learn and understand on a daily basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>2</td><td>Computer programming falls into the same pitfall that most other IT positions do.  Working overtime without pay is far too common an expectation in this career.  My current job has a normal schedule of 45 hours, which is 5 over the standard full time schedule (without extra compensation).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>8</td><td>A large part of computer programming is working within a team environment to accomplish a much larger goal.  By nature, this means that computer programming comes with a requirement of working in a very social environment.</td></tr>

<tr><td>School Rating</td><td>8</td><td>The computer science program at Michigan was very hands on - teaching coding principles through complex projects.  I feel that this hands on approach better prepared me for the workplace than grads from other college programs that seemed more theoretical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opportunity for Promotion</td><td>10</td><td>Being in a small, growing company leaves ample opportunity for somebody like myself who is a hard worker to get promoted.  As our development team continues to grow, more lead positions and team leaders continue to open up which creates more of a vertical structure, allowing for more opportunities for promotion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Security</td><td>9</td><td>I feel that I have very high job security since I'm at a small company with a very complex codebase.  Since I've been here for a couple years, I'm one of only a few people who has intimate knowledge of the different services in our codebase and I am also valued highly for my work ethic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Earnings Potential</td><td>8</td><td>Programming careers can offer pretty good salaries.  However, it's hard to get a top of the line salary unless you get into being a programmer in the financial industry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>8</td><td>The stress fluctuates quite a bit, but being a developer at a small, fast moving company can be pretty stressful at times as you're trying to continue to put out new features, fix bugs, and keep clients happy.  Programming jobs at bigger companies aren't quite as stressful because you can be more focused on one area.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>8</td><td>Working in a smaller development shop can lead to a big variation in day-to-day activities.  One day I can be spending time creating elaborate new code, the next day tracking down a live bug, and the next day looking into new technology solutions to better host our applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>7</td><td>I don't consider there to be a lot of glamour or prestige, but programming can be very exciting, especially on a small team at a fast growing company.  However, there is a certain coolness factor to a lot of development companies, and they try to do fun things to treat their employees well and make the job more attractive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>8</td><td>I consider my career to be pretty flexible.  At my current job we have very flexible hours and the ability to work from home some of the time.  Job locations tend to center on bigger cities, but there are many contracting and other remote work opportunities as well.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>8</td><td>My particular career is highly social, working in an open environment with several other programmers.  We also have many work sponsored and non work sponsored events where we enjoy socializing because of the many different, interesting, and intelligent people we work with.</td></tr>

Management requires a different personality and skill set which is kind of opposite of most software people.  Some companies have a parallel track for promotion within the technical ranks, however, so a person can get promoted to project manager, senior scientist, etc.</td></tr>

Competent software developers are very valuable to the company.  This is true in general at other companies too, I would think.  Software developers stay in high demand.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>8</td><td>Depends on the company, of course, but in general, software development lends itself to being done at almost any location, anytime of day, so opportunities to work at home or from across the country are there.  Video conferencing helps for coordinating, meeting with clients, etc.  The need for software development is pervasive, so lots of opportunities in lots of places.  Specializations, such as information security, are available too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>3</td><td>There is interaction within the software development team, and with clients.  But mainly there is a lot of solitary work.  Software developers do like to go out to lunch together and share their wacky senses of humor.</td></tr>

<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>5</td><td>Stress in this career is mainly on the administrative side, just like in any office job.  Working with failed hardware and software is really part of the joy of this job, in that you figure out the problem and then solve it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>5</td><td>Daily tasks do vary, though the set of tasks done each week stay basically the same.  Every few years, my job has changed underneath me, where I keep the same managers, but find my set of daily and weekly tasks have changed dramatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>2</td><td>Working in a government office has never been cool.  Unless one is working directly for the governor, there is very little prestige, glamor or excitement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>6</td><td>Flexible work schedules, including options for part-time work and for tele-commuting, have been easily obtainable throughout my career of government service.  There has been little choice of other locations in which to work. Career options and specialization have varied greatly over the years.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>5</td><td>Because most of the social interactions during my career took place in an office and not in isolated locales, I rate this one Average.  Most of the interaction, however, has been usually over the phone and via email, neither of which are conducive to the strongest social interplay.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Rating</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td>School Rating</td><td>7</td><td>Columbus State Community College isn't nearly as large or well-recognized as other local universities (such as the Ohio State University). But, the school provides an exceptional education at a very reasonable cost.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opportunity for Promotion</td><td>5</td><td>The opportunities for advancing in my current position using my current programming language are fairly slim.  We are a small group with well-tenured employees in the higher level positions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Security</td><td>8</td><td>In the short-term, my position is very secure.  I work for a very stable company and the programming language that I use is not a common one, and we use an unsupported, outdated version. So, finding outside programmers who know this language and version has proven difficult.  But the long-term prospect is not good, as we will eventually phase out use of the language to opt for more .Net programming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Earnings Potential</td><td>8</td><td>I am underpaid at the moment because I don't have complete knowledge of a marketable programming language.  However, once I complete my certification program, my prospects should greatly increase.  There will be more opportunities at my current company to work in another language, as well as the ability to prospect for positions at other companies or as a consultant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>8</td><td>Every project was needed yesterday, it seems. It gets stressful because of the urgency of emerging new ideas, the demands of good design, the general lack of resources, on-call rotation, and the complexity of making it work with existing (antiquated) code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>3</td><td>We have many tasks to perform, like coding, collaborating, design, debugging, etc.  However, we do these same things in varying amounts pretty much every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>3</td><td>I wouldn't say it's cool or glamorous, but some folks assume a programming position pays very well.  There's a bit of prestige involved because we understand things about how computers work that seems a mystery to some of the general public.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>6</td><td>My department is fairly flexible when it comes to work hours. We have core hours generally from 9am to 3pm and can come or go as we please in both arrival and departure as long as we complete the necessary weekly hours for our salaried positions.  Time off during the day for appointments and home life needs are accepted without too much question, as long as the privilege is not abused.  I even telecommute on occasion.  I wish there were more options for part-time work and location selection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>6</td><td>While a good portion of my profession is the quiet relationship between me and my keyboard, there is a lot of human interaction going on as well.  We have a small team that is very supportive of each other's shared endeavors and do a lot of collaborative project design and implementation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>School Rating</td><td>6</td><td>In school, I learned some basics about computing through some archaic languages (i.e. FORTRAN and C++). Today there are many more languages (Python, JAVA, etc) that I have had to learn on my own, outside of an academic environment.  I wish my school had been more cutting edge at the time.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Job Security</td><td>8</td><td>I work in defense contracting.  Even though there has been an economic downturn, my work load has not decreased.  I  have noticed salary cuts lately, but my reviews have been positive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Earnings Potential</td><td>6</td><td>I know I could earn more if I started managing projects or co-workers, however that holds little interest for me.  I am happy being an "individual" contributor.  Because of that, I feel like I am limited in my earnings potential.  Still, I fell like I make a comfortable wage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>5</td><td>I guess I don't know that much about the stress in other people's lives.  In my job I have deadlines that I suppose are normal.  Some of the stress in my job is due to the fact that I know what's on the line (National Security) if I "get it wrong."  However, there are so many checks and balances for my work that I don't get to worried.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>3</td><td>My job generally involves coding up different signal processing algorithms that have been developed by scientists or mathematicians in other departments.  I am satisfied with my role and like the fact that my tasks are pretty predictable.  I know that there are other programmers who have jobs that require much more innovation; that does not appeal to me.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>3</td><td>I don't think of my job or myself as very "cool." I know there are others who might like my flexibility and I have some co-workers I consider "cool."  However, it is not their jobs that makes me think of them this way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>9</td><td>About 50% of the time I can work from wherever I want.  I do some work that requires classified facilities and can only be executed on certain systems.  90% of the time, though, I can work whenever I want. I have a couple of meetings a week I must attend, but other that that I work when I want to, as long as I complete my tasks.</td></tr>

<tr><td>School Rating</td><td>9</td><td>Stockton is a feeder school for NAFEC.  Because NAFEC uses specialized programming languages, the curriculum focuses on understanding proper programming thinking as opposed to training in a particular language.  So you graduate with the ability to quickly learn any programming language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opportunity for Promotion</td><td>6</td><td>If you're talented and can produce, you receive pay increases and title changes.  But in general, programming is a narrow world - if you get "promoted" to, say, manager or director, that typically means you leave the confines of programming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Job Security</td><td>7</td><td>Simply put, if you're competent at software development, there is work available for you.  It's common for programmers to move to different employers in a 3-7 yr cycle, but in general there is always work available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Earnings Potential</td><td>7</td><td>Programmers are well compensated on an hourly/salary basis.  However, there typically is not "unlimited" earning or recurring revenue capabilities - there is a ceiling on how much you can make.  Fortunately, that often can be well into 6 figures/yr.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Stressful</td><td>8</td><td>Technology is constantly changing, and you need to keep up to stay on top of your game.  Software life cycles are typically required on tight or emergency deadlines. You need to be able to work long hours and make things happen.  And you are accountable for the success or failure of projects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Task Variety</td><td>5</td><td>Depends on the position.  I've known programmers who spent 7 years making changes to the exact same 1000 lines of code.  And others are on the cutting edge, innovating new ideas every day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>How Cool Is The Career</td><td>8</td><td>Nerds and hackers are generally fun and interesting.  Many projects are cutting edge and unique.  And finally, fashion has caught up and has made nerd chic mainstream.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Career Flexibility</td><td>9</td><td>Programming careers are really flexible, and limited only by your imagination and creativity.  Every industry has a need or potential need for software, so there is unlimited opportunity for specialization.  Remote work and working from home is possible with many jobs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Social Orientation</td><td>6</td><td>You have to work with business and other developers on a regular basis.  Team communication, organization, and cooperation is important.  I've always made strong friendships by working in these team environments.</td></tr>
