<p>The Commodore 64 is the worlds biggest selling computer model of all times.  It was a 64K machine based on the Motorola 6502 processor and the entire unit was basically a fat keyboard with ports for attaching displays, drives and other peripherals.</p>

<img src="images/c64system.jpg" width="799" height="598" alt="The Commodore 64 system" border="2"/>

<p>The full system (not attached to a monitor) is pictured above.  The power supply is a neat aftermarket unit that provides line conditioning and a spot to plug in additional items such as the disk drive (1541 shown) and a display.</p>
<img src="images/c64boxed.jpg" width="799" height="600" alt="Boxed Commodore 64" border="2"/>
<p>The system came with it's original boxes.</p>

<img src="images/c64docs.jpg" width="799" height="598" alt="Commodore 64 manuals" border="2"/>
<p>And most of the original manuals as well.</p>

<img src="images/c64fastload.jpg" width="799" height="600" alt="The all-important fast load cartridge" border="2"/>

<p>The system also came with an Epyx FastLoad cartridge.  Not shown are the many applications and games that came with the system.</p>

People I knew preferred one or the other, but both groups respected both machines.<br> <br> I was an Apple II fan. The C64 was superior for graphics and sound, but it's Achilles' heel was that floppy disk drive. If Jack Tramiel had built a drive as fast, reliable and easy to use as the Apple II drive, Steve Jobs might have been the second Nolan Bushnell.<p>

<hr>(Submitted December 30, 2008 14:22:42 by <a href=mailto:gclouse@clearwire.net>Gary</a>)<p> A bit of lore about the 6502 processor. The 6502 was based on the T6500 and T6501 processors designed at Motorola. As the story has it, the 6500 series was dropped in favor of the 6800 series and the designers on the T6500 and T6501 quit Motorola and founded MOS Technology to manufacture the 6501 processor. This violated certain contractual agreements ( Intellectual Property Ownership ) so some of the Motorla people help redesign the chip to avoid the bad PR of the Big Corporation sues plucks entrepreneur fiasco, while saving face for both Motorola and its former employees. Becasue of its low price, the 6502 was picked up by many hobbyists and pretty much kick-started the Home computer business. Eventually MOS Technology was bought by Commodore.<p>

<hr>(Submitted September 17, 2008 23:33:23 by <a href=mailto:dsionov@sionova.com>Dan Sionov</a>)<p> I had a Commodore growing up. Despite how inferior it was by today's standards, I still have very fond memories. It felt almost like you're a pioneer venturing into uncharted territory.<br> <br> Now-a-days, everyone have computers and they don't seem as interesting any more. It's all just part of life.<br> <br> Anyway, as I type, I'm getting feelings of nostalgia. So, if anyone has a Commodore 64 they'd like to off-load in the Washington, DC Metro area, let me know.<p>


<hr>(Submitted September 17, 2008 12:06:24 by <a href=mailto:lodger@gmx.de>lodger</a>)<p> Aaah, what sweet memories I have regarding this computer. In fact, I still have my old one, pimped with a RetroReplay, MMC64 and RRnet cartridge / addon. Now I use Contiki OS to connect to the web via TCP/IP (and the RRnet, of course!). Also, today you can do C coding for this machine, using the cc65 C Compiler. Yes, people: the Commodore 64 is still a good machine and it is everything but dead (wanna proof?

<hr>(Submitted November 17, 2006 23:50:14 by <a href=mailto:traymond_1@yahoo.com>Terry Raymond</a>)<p> There is a company by the name of Creative Micro Designs that supported C=64 & C=128 from 1987 to june,2001. In around June,2001 Maurice Randall Click Here software in Charlotte,MI bought all the rights to CMD C= hardware, including copying & distribution rights to GEOS2.0. Maurice calls this now: CMDRKEY, website: www.cmdrkey.com CMD first in 1986 designed Jiffy Dos which is a Dos upgrade for both C=64 and C=128, after that CMD went on to design other really good hardware. Maurice Randall is trying to keep this going but sadly doesnt get his orders filled on time. CMD at: www.cmd.com no longer supports this hardware, CMD is now into PC and Macintosh etc. CMDRKEY is located in Charlotte, MI Maurice Randall also in 1998 wrote a new GEOS 2.0 upgrade called Wheels OS, for both C=64 and C=128. So think twice about selling your Commodore 64 or 128 setups, they are still very useful.<p>

Hiya All,
Im looking for a 1571 Floopy drive for my 
collection, Im in london and Im willing to lay 
out ?30 for one. Also if anyone has a Commodore 
Z80 CPM Cartridge I'd pay ?15 for one, just so I 
can experience CP/M on the C64C.<br>
<br>
email: jhernon@btinternet.com<br>
<br>
Well I started out on the C64 then 128 then A500 
then A1200 then I switched to PC's and dumped 
all the gear. Now after working in IT for 18 
Years programming VB/C/C++/SQL/PROGRESS 
4GL/PASCAL/Wahtever etc etc etc <br>
<br>
Im now starting collecting vintage C64 stuff and 
I really want to get my hands on a Z80- CPM 
CARTRIDGE that Commodore produced with the 
original CP/M Disks. If anyone spots one then 
please email me. The I can do some Z80 
Programming on the Commodore 64C.<br>
<br>
If anyone is really interested in an real cool 
system then search Google for C-ONE which 
emulates the C64.<br>

Thanks

my C64 emulators better. Yeah, I use it for 
internet, music, DVD and CD mastering. But, when 
I want to relax, I pull out some old issues of 
RUN or Computes Gazzette, and re-type some magic. 
I have 4 C64's, 1 VIC-20, 2 tape drives, 5 disk

and still don't know what it is.  IT has a 25

and two things on the other end joined on the

the c-64 or atari.  What the heck is this thing?<p>

You're right, John.  What I really don't deserve,

(Change UPPERCASE words to reply)<br>
<br>
My second PC was a C=64.  My first was a VIC-20,
while my third was a C=128D.  I did my first
assembly level programming on these machines.  I
once wrote code to read the directory off the
floppy and sort it using the shell sort
alogorithm.  Ah, those were the days...  BTW, the
6502 was designed by Rockwell and (some of) the
computers on the first space shuttles used the
6502.  MOS was a second source for the 6502. 
Later, CBM bought MOS and produced the 6510 used
in the C=64 and the 8510 used in the C=128.  The
C=128D actually had three CPUs: an 8510 to run in
either C=64 or C=128 mode, a Zilog Z80 to run
CP/M, and a 6502 in the integral 1571 floppy disk
drive.<p>

The C64 was my first computer as well as for a 
plenty of readers and visitors of this page. I 
bought it about 1982 and for about 10 years the 
C64 was used. I could gather my first experiences 
on hardware and software. It is still somewhere in 
the roof of my parents house, but I wont sell it. 
To find this page is allmost like a sentimental 
journey back to this time, we spent a lot nights 
in front of an TV set, fighting against enemies 
and so on. It was a long long way for the PC of 
today, before they could provide similar features 
and performance to their users, for instance 
stereo sound instead of anoying beep sounds. 
Sometime I am using a simulator, like VICE, to 
play some old games, it is ok - but it is not the 
same feeling. BTW, do you remember that MULTIPLAN, 
the predecessor of todays EXCELL, was running on 
C64?<p>

Yes, MOS made it, and to further nitpick, it's 
actually a 6510 which has an extra IO port on it, 
which the C-64 uses for switching RAM and ROM in 
and out of the 64k addressing space.<br>
<br>
And there are still thousands of people using the 
C-64... check out lemon64.com, gb64.com, c64.sk, 
comp.sys.cbm - both nostalgia and new 
hardware/software developments.<p>

I have a Commodore 64 cassette drive. Need it? 
What is your offer? I JUST tossed out TONS of 
software the other day - sorry! <p>

No pic of the comm 64? There must've been millions
made!<p>

I loved the Commodore, and did my household 
budgets on it using VisiCalc. Worked great. Then 
I got the Geos operating system...it was a slow 
dog, and in the end I got less done. Tell me that 
isn't the PC evolution in a nutshell! I also 
taught myself Commodore Basic, and that knowledge 
has been a benefit to me all my career as I build 
macros, AppleScript, Visual Basic, HTML, etc. In 
the end, knowing any command-line language is 
like knowing Latin...it's the key to all the 
other languages out there. Regards to all you 
fellow fans!<p>

I own 2 complete commodore 64C systems that I 
would sell and have tons of software for them ! 
Anyone who is interested email me<p>

The 6502 was made by MOS Technology not Motorola.
