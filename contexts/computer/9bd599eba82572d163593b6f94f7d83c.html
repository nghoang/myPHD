                    that helps to construct and test regular expressions allowed in XML Schema restriction
                    patterns. You can now quickly generate a large set of XML document samples based on a

                    Enhancer V.3.0 for Windows and Macintosh. The new algorithm introduced in v. 3.0 makes
                    this detail-revealing software yet more efficient. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">It may happen that a photographer will
                    take a great photo but some details within it will be lost due to unevenness of exposure;
                    faces may be cast in shadow, or scenery wiped out by overexposure. Merely manipulating the
                    brightness and contrast of the whole frame with photo editing software can improve the
                    problem in some portions of a photo, but might then spoil other areas that need different
                    treatment. Here lies the strength of AKVIS Enhancer. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">AKVIS Enhancer strengthens the difference
                    between adjacent pixels having different color gradations and reveals details within
                    shadowed, overexposed or mid-tone areas. Where other similar programs may achieve
                    acceptable results by manipulating two to four shots of the same scene, AKVIS Enhancer
                    applies advanced algorithms to a single shot for spectacular outcome. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Most images can be improved at default
                    settings. For further adjustment you have four parameters at your disposal: Details in
                    Shadows, Details in Highlights, Level of Detail and Lightness.<br>
                    The new improved algorithm prevents noise that may appear on a photo after a dramatic
                    increase in detail. Now the resulting image is sharper and more natural. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The new version of AKVIS Enhancer
                    supports 16 bits per channel. It gives you the opportunity to process images without
                    losses in quality. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">In addition to its appeal to the amateur
                    photographer and home user, AKVIS Enhancer is a highly useful tool in the production of
                    technical and industrial photographs, or for revealing subtle details within medical
                    imaging and forensic photos. Demonstrations of AKVIS Enhancer's features are available at
                    http://akvis.com/en/enhancer-tutorial/index.php . <br>
                    AKVIS Enhancer plugin is compatible with Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, Corel
                    Painter, Corel Photo-Paint, Jasc Paint Shop Pro, ACD FotoCanvas, and Ulead PhotoImpact.
                    AKVIS Enhancer runs on Microsoft Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/NT and on Macintosh Mac OS X 10.4
                    (Tiger), PowerPC G3 and above. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Our kids frequently ask us to read
                    something aloud. However, the adults often need somebody to read for them too. That is why
                    1st Read It Aloud! was created. Since now, Windows user is able to make his documents,
                    emails, web pages, books and written thoughts sound with the voice he prefers and with the
                    pitch, speed, and volume he would like to. 1st Read It Aloud1 doesn't need text for
                    reading to be copied into clipboard so user will save his previous clipboard content. The
                    program supports numerous voices in more than twenty different languages. It also supports
                    both old SAPI4 and new SAPI5 speech synthesis technologies. User is encouraged to let
                    computer talk with him and read him aloud as his parents did in childhood. </font></p>

                    Word documents. 1st Read It Aloud! offers the solution of this problem called Voice Slots.
                    Each Voice Slot contains its own voice with pitch, speed, and volume presets and can be
                    activated with individual hot key. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Actual Tools announced today the release
                    of version 2.7 of Actual Window Guard, a handy desktop enhancement application to better
                    control windows at the system startup and application launch. With its innovative window
                    controls, seamless integration into the system shell and ease of use, Actual Window Guard
                    is an ideal solution for users who want to automatically &quot;discipline&quot; their
                    &quot;unruly&quot; windows without endlessly customizing them manually. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Actual Window Guard v. 2.7 seamlessly
                    expands the functionality of Windows and allows its users to get preset application
                    windows minimized, maximized or closed automatically at the system startup or an
                    application launch. Besides, the program saves the position and/or size of any window so
                    that when the user launches an application, it &quot;knows&quot; its exact place on the
                    desktop and window size. Working with several applications at a time, the user may set a
                    particular priority status for each application. Once set, it will always remain the same
                    unless the user wants to change it. Furthermore, the user may enable the &quot;Stay on
                    Top&quot; option to put any selected application window on top of all the others. While
                    the application has preliminary settings for most popular programs, the user can easily
                    add and configure any other application by accessing the Configuration Module via its
                    system tray icon. For a complete list of the program's options, please, visit the
                    company's website a!<br>

                    options as 1) Align window; 2) Set window position when it is created; 3) Set window size
                    when it is created. Now the user may get any application window aligned with any of the 9
                    positions on the desktop - upper-left, upper-central, upper-right, etc. Also, while the
                    previous version can only &quot;remember&quot; the position and size of a window as the
                    user left it last time, version 2.7 also allows setting window coordinates and size

                    problem of searching for information more than once. Irregardless of the data source we
                    are using (Internet, file system on our hard drive, data base or a global information
                    system of a big company) the problems can be multiple and include the physical volume of
                    the data base searched, the information being unstructured, different file types and also
                    the complexity of accurately wording the search query. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">We have already reached the stage when
                    the amount of data on one single PC is comparable to the amount of text data stored in a
                    proper library. And as to the unstructured data flows, in future they are only going to
                    increase, and at a very rapid tempo. If for an average user this might be just a minor
                    misfortune, for a big company absence of control over information can mean significant
                    problems. </font></p>

                    and technologies simplifying and accelerating access to the necessary information,
                    originate!<br>
                    d long ago. Such systems are numerous and moreover not every one of them is based on a
                    unique technology. And the task of choosing the right one depends directly on the specific
                    tasks to be solved in the future. While the demand for the perfect data searching and
                    processing tools is steadily growing let's consider the state of affairs with the supply
                    side. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Not going deeply into the various
                    peculiarities of the technology, all the searching programs and systems can be divided
                    into three groups. These are: global Internet systems, turnkey business solutions
                    (corporate data searching and processing technologies) and simple phrasal or file search
                    on a local computer. Different directions presumably mean different solutions. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Local search<br>
                    Everything is clear about search on a local PC. It's not remarkable for any particular
                    functionality features accept for the choice of file type (media, text etc.) and the
                    search destination. Just enter the name of the searched file (or part of text, for example
                    in the Word format) and that's it. The speed and result depend fully on the text entered
                    into the query line. There is zero intellectuality in this: simply looking through the
                    available files to define their relevance. This is in its sense explicable: what's the use
                    of creating a sophisticated system for such uncomplicated needs. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Global search technologies<br>
                    Matters stand totally different with the search systems operating in the global network.
                    One can't rely simply on looking through the available data. Huge volume (Yandex for
                    instance can boast the indexing capacity of more than 11 terabyte of data) of the global
                    chaos of unstructured information will make the simple search not only ineffective but
                    also long and labor-consuming. That's why lately the focus has shifted towards optimizing
                    and improving quality characteristics of search. But the scheme is still very simple
                    (except for the secret innovations of every separate system) - the phrasal search through
                    the indexed data base with proper consideration for morphology and synonyms. Undoubtedly,
                    such an approach works but doesn't solve the problem completely. Reading dozens of various
                    articles dedicated to improving search with the help of Google or Yandex, one can drive at
                    the conclusion that without knowing the hidden opportunities of these systems finding a
                    relevant docum!<br>
                    ent by the query is a matter of more than a minute, and sometimes more than an hour. The
                    problem is that such a realization of search is very dependent on the query word or
                    phrase, entered by the user. The more indistinct the query the worse is the search. This
                    has become an axiom, or dogma, whichever you prefer.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Of course, intelligently using the key
                    functions of the search systems and properly defining the phrase by which the documents
                    and sites are searched, it is possible to get acceptable results. But this would be the
                    result of painstaking mental work and time wasted on looking through irrelevant
                    information with a hope to at least find some clues on how to upgrade the search query. In
                    general, the scheme is the following: enter the phrase, look through several results,
                    making sure that the query was not the right one, enter a new phrase and the stages are
                    repeated till the relevancy of results achieves the highest possible level. But even in
                    that case the chances to find the right document are still few. No average user will
                    voluntary go for the sophistication of &quot;advanced search&quot; (although it is
                    equipped with a number of very useful functions such as the choice of language, file
                    format etc.). The best would be to simply insert the word or phrase and get a ready
                    answer, withou!<br>
                    t particular concern for the means of getting it. Let the horse think - it has a big head.
                    Maybe this is not exactly up to the point, but one of the Google search functions is
                    called &quot;I am feeling lucky!&quot; characterizes very well the existent searching
                    technologies. Nevertheless, the technology works, not ideally and not always justifying
                    the hopes, but if you allow for the complexity of searching through the chaos of Internet
                    data volume, it could be acceptable. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Corporate systems<br>
                    The third on the list are the turnkey solutions based on the searching technologies. They
                    are meant for serious companies and corporations, possessing really large data bases and
                    staffed with all sorts of information systems and documents. In principle, the
                    technologies themselves can also be used for home needs. For example, a programmer working
                    remotely from the office will make good use of the search to access randomly located on
                    his hard drive program source codes. But these are particulars. The main application of
                    the technology is still solving the problem of quickly and accurately searching through
                    large data volumes and working with various information sources. Such systems usually
                    operate by a very simple scheme (although there are undoubtedly numerous unique methods of
                    indexing and processing queries underneath the surface): phrasal search, with proper
                    consideration for all the stem forms, synonyms etc. which once again leads us to the
                    problem of human resource. When using such technology the user should first word the query
                    phrases which are going to be the search criteria and presumably met in the necessary
                    documents to be retrieved. But there is no guarantee that the user will be able to
                    independently choose or remember the correct phrase and furthermore, that the search by
                    this phrase will be satisfactory.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">One more key moment is the speed of
                    processing a query. Of course, when using the whole document instead of a couple of words,
                    the accuracy of search increases manifold. But up to date, such an opportunity has not
                    been used because of the high capacity drain of such a process. The point is that search
                    by words or phrases will not provide us with a highly relevant similarity of results. And
                    the search by phrase equal in its length the whole document consumes much time and
                    computer resources. Here is an example: while processing the query by one word there is no
                    considerable difference in speed: whether it's 0,1 or 0,001 second is not of crucial
                    importance to the user. But when you take an average size document which contains about
                    2000 unique words, then the search with consideration for morphology (stem forms) and
                    thesaurus (synonyms), as well as generating a relevant list of results in case of search
                    by key words will take several dozens of minutes (which is unacceptable for a user). </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The interim summary<br>
                    As we can see, currently existing systems and search technologies, although properly
                    functioning, don't solve the problem of search completely. Where speed is acceptable the
                    relevancy leaves more to be desired. If the search is accurate and adequate, it consumes
                    lots of time and resources. It is of course possible to solve the problem by a very
                    obvious manner - by increasing the computer capacity. But equipping the office with dozens
                    of ultra-fast computers which will continuously process phrasal queries consisting of
                    thousands of unique words, struggling through gigabytes of incoming correspondence,
                    technical literature, final reports and other information is more than irrational and
                    disadvantageous. There is a better way. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The unique similar content search<br>
                    At present many companies are intensively working on developing full text search. The
                    calculation speeds allow creating technologies that enable queries in different exponents
                    and wide array of supplementary conditions. The experience in creating phrasal search
                    provides these companies with an expertise to further develop and perfect the search
                    technology. In particular, one of the most popular searches is the Google, and namely one
                    of its functions called the &quot;similar pages&quot;. Using this function enables the
                    user to view the pages of maximum similarity in their content to the sample one.
                    Functioning in principle, this function does not yet allow getting relevant results - they
                    are mostly vague and of low relevancy and furthermore, sometimes utilizing this function
                    shows complete absence of similar pages as a result. Most probably, this is the result of
                    the chaotic and unstructured nature of information in the Internet. But once the precedent
                    has been created, the advent of the perfect search without a hitch is just a matter of
                    time. </font></p>

                    processing and knowledge retrieval systems, here the matters stand much worse. The
                    functioning (not existing on paper) technologies are very few. And no giant or the so
                    called search technology guru has so far succeeded in creating a real similar content
                    search. Maybe, the reason is that it's not desperately needed, maybe - too hard to
                    implement. But there is a functioning one though. </font></p>

                    by SoftInform, is the technology of searching for documents similar in their content to
                    the sample. It enables fast and accurate search for documents of similar content in any
                    volume of data. The technology is based on the mathematical model of analyzing the
                    document structure and selecting the words, word combinations and text arrays, which
                    results in forming a list of documents of maximum similarity the sample text abstract with
                    the relevancy percent defined. In contrast to the standard phrasal search by the similar
                    content search there is no need to determine the key words beforehand - the search is
                    conducted through the whole document. The technology works with several sources of
                    information that can be stored both in text files of txt, doc, rtf, pdf, htm, html
                    formats, and the information systems of the most popular data bases (Access, MS SQL,
                    Oracle, as well as any SQL-supporting data bases). It also additionally supports the
                    synonyms and important words functions that enable to carry out a more specific search. <br>
                    The similar search technology enables to significantly cut time wasted on searching and
                    reviewing the same or very similar documents, diminish the processing time at the stage of
                    entering data into the archive by avoiding the duplicate documents and forming sets of
                    data by a certain subject. Another advantage of the SoftInform technology is that it's not
                    so sensitive to the computer capacity and allows processing data at a very high speed even
                    on ordinary office computers. </font></p>

                    correspondence and news which will become an important tool for analysts from different
                    companies. Mainly, this will be possible due to the unique similar content search
                    technology, absent from any of the existent systems so far except for the SearchInform. </font></p>

                    with the so called doorways (hidden pages with key words redirecting to the site's main
                    pages and used to increase the page rating with the search engines) and the e-mail spam
                    problem (a more intellectual analysis would ensure higher level of security) would also be
                    solved with the help of this technology. But the most interesting perspective of the
                    SoftInform Search technology is creating a new Internet search engine, the main
                    competitive advantage of which would be ability to search not just by key words, but also
                    for similar web pages, which will add to the flexibility of search making it more

                    with confidence that the future belongs to the full text search technologies, both in the
                    Internet and the corporate search systems. Unlimited development potential, adequacy of
                    the results and processing speed of any size of query make this technology much more
                    comfortable and in high demand. SoftInform Search technology might not be the pioneer, but
                    it's a functioning, stable and unique one with no existent analogues (which can be proved
                    by the active Eurasian patent). To my mind, even with the help of the &quot;similar
                    search&quot; it will be difficult to find a similar technology. <br>

                    Internet is flooded today with undesirable advertising letters also known as spam. Both
                    for an ordinary user connecting to Internet via dialup and for various companies paying
                    for the dedicated line or using DSL spam equals wasted megabytes of information. The
                    megabytes, which are paid for. And time, wasted on viewing advertising offers of
                    unnecessary things or services.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Currently there are a lot of ways to
                    guard your email box against unceasing attacks of &#147;Viagra&#148;, tourist

                    which can be bought cheaply and simply. One of the cures could be changing the email
                    account. But this is by no means a panacea: in a while the new box will be displaying
                    nonsense newsletters from all over the world. You can of course use the server-inbuilt
                    filters or paid resources which try to minimize the spam flow, letting through just the
                    letters from &#147;authorized addressers&#148;. But the server filters block just a small
                    part of proposals to &#147;enlarge&#148; or &#147;relax&#148;. And the powerful
                    &#147;authorization&#148; protection is, first, expensive (plus a monthly fee), and
                    second, is very inconvenient for people on the contact-list (they have to undergo a

                    To clean the mail account from spam a universal anti-advertising shield is needed which
                    will save the money otherwise wasted on downloading weighty letters traffic and the time
                    otherwise lost on viewing and deleting them. Such a shield is the programs which remotely
                    check the mail in the user box without uploading them and block unwanted letters
                    immediately at the server. Such programs are many. They differ in interface and
                    functionality, but have one thing in common: obligatory check of email at the server.
                    Without this feature there would be no sense in the blockers at all. To upload messages
                    and check them locally is not a big deal. The applications differ in their settings, spam
                    filtering ways, speed of work and different features enabling maximum efficiency. The most
                    wide-spread way of blocking spam is by letter headings and continuously updated list of
                    &#147;illegitimate&#148; addresses, which are known as harmful advertisements
                    distributors. <br>

                    (&#147;clean&#148;) accounts? Dozens of letters daily burn you and your company megabytes
                    of far from free traffic? All you need to do is to install Spam Blocker, in such a way

                    functionality of the proven but so far stand-alone ShipCAM solution into ShipConstructor,
                    thus running inside AutoCAD. Users will be able to open ShipCAM files, import 3DM (Rhino)

                    ShipConstructor2005 will see the introduction of the smart Bill of Materials (BOM), which
                    will enable users to improve on their project delivery times and overall product quality.
                    The BOMs are dynamically linked to the backend SQL server database to make updating
                    production drawings much easier. The entire BOM is a smart object that the user can
                    resize, while also changing colors, styles, and grid types to conform to individual
                    company standards. Furthermore, a change in the BOM will automatically update any labels
                    in place, retaining the often-significant efforts users have made. The smart BOMs will
                    become part of the assembly drawings, pipe spool and HVAC spool drawings, as well as
                    arrangement drawings. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Improved Database Integration &#150; The
                    Manager module now provides easier integration with the client&#146;s databases. UserID,
                    ModelNo and OrderID are new fields that allow easy linking of the ShipConstructor project
                    database with the customer&#146;s purchasing and material handling databases.
                    Manager&#146;s Custom Reports have also been enhanced with additional fields for
                    better-tailored production reports, saving valuable time once needed for Production to
                    request more information manually from Engineering. Also, users can add Spooled and/or
                    No-Spool items to Custom Reports in order to monitor the engineering progress on the
                    various pipe systems. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Pipe Module Enhancements &#150; Pipe
                    display performance has been vastly improved in response to the ever-growing project sizes
                    undertaken by ShipConstructor users, yielding a great performance improvement in
                    operations such as panning, zooming, orbiting, and regeneration. The level of detail
                    displayed on screen can be adjusted by the user as required for the task at hand.
                    Replacing pipe objects due to last minute specification changes has become much easier.
                    The Find and Replace function allows the replacement of all pipe items. Still spec-driven,
                    the function can easily swap out any number or type of objects while still retaining their
                    original orientations. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><strong>New Pricing Options </strong><br>
                    With ShipConstructor2005, ARL now offers two new pricing options in addition to the proven
                    Perpetual License Option and the Lease License Option: With the new Annual Renewable
                    License the user can distribute his payments over several years. The new Month-To-Month
                    Rent License is advantageous when the user needs to supplement existing licenses during
                    peak demands or when consulting companies want to send their experts to their jobs with
                    ShipConstructor in hand. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000"><strong>Future Plans </strong><br>

                    of the ZoomV3, the second major product in the company's VoIP product <br>
                    line. The V3 connects to the Ethernet port of a cable modem or ADSL <br>
                    modem, and includes a router, advanced firewall, 4-port switching hub, <br>
                    and TelePort(TM) VoIP port. Zoom's exclusive TelePort feature lets users<br>
                    make conventional telephone calls or VoIP calls from the same phone. </font></p>

                    dialing, toll-free number dialing, or in the event of a power<br>
                    failure. The V3's TelePort also allows conventional phone service to<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Revelation Helpdesk 3.2 helps IT
                    departments and technical support organizations improve their end user support programs
                    with an intuitive approach to incident management that maximizes human resources,
                    streamlines processes and improves customer service. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">While the base configuration offers an
                    effective helpdesk solution for small and mid-sized organizations supporting hundreds of
                    end users, Revelation 3.2's modular structure is scaleable to organizations with thousands
                    of end users. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The nimble, browser-based interface of
                    Revelation 3.2 enables service professionals to receive and report on the disposition of
                    more end-user incidents in real time. Statistics gathered by YellowFish Software show that
                    technicians can log a service call in half the time it takes in other systems. In
                    addition, Revelation 3.2 delivers a high return on investment with a low total cost of
                    ownership for IT management. This is particularly appealing to corporate, government,
                    legal, outsourced IT providers and educational customers in tough economic times. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">According to YellowFish CEO, Nick
                    Juliusburger, &quot;This is a system designed by helpdesk professionals for helpdesk
                    professionals. Revelation 3.2 evolved from a very simple customer request: Help desk
                    management has long asked for a cost-effective incident tracking software. Revelation
                    Helpdesk offers the right benefits -- precision tracking, ease-of-use and forward-looking
                    management reporting -- to IT professionals who are 'time-crunched' and frustrated by
                    ineffective products.&quot; </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Juliusburger added that, &quot;Our
                    customers are our most important asset. Revelation Helpdesk 3.2 contains many of their
                    most requested enhancements. It is this desire to listen to our users that helps
                    Revelation evolve and continue to meet the needs of all constituents in the IT support
                    process -- support staff, management and end users -- improving efficiencies and
                    productivity for each. We believe this is the reason for our 90+ percent customer
                    satisfaction.&quot; </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">According to Monica Rhoden, a support
                    engineer with St. Joseph&#146;s Hospital of Augusta, and a Revelation customer, &quot;We
                    used Support Magic for many years and find Revelation Helpdesk to be very user friendly
                    and easy to navigate. We had no trouble switching to a web based application. Revelation
                    has exceeded our initial expectations.&quot; </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Notably, Revelation 3.2's new licensing
                    model offers customers a base configuration with additional modules that tailor the
                    software to clients' specific needs. There are eight modules that customers can choose to
                    purchase. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Revelation 3.2 also features integrated
                    activity, performance, trend, resource and administrative reports to help managers monitor
                    help desk activity and plan for the future; an intuitive ticket management system that
                    makes it easy to know the status of open tickets; prioritization capabilities to
                    rationalize support labor commitments; SLA management features with support for working
                    hours and holidays; escalation features including 'respond by,' 'resolve by' dates and
                    alarms to insure they are met; Web-based architecture that requires little or no
                    maintenance of the application by IT staff; customizable IT staff and end-user interfaces,
                    including status of all problems logged; email submission of tickets, including
                    attachments; an ergonomic interface with no screen clutter; compliance with Government
                    rule Section 508 related to handicapped access; and work requests that are adjusted in
                    real time for any time zone. </font></p>

                    tapes, plus any work done since the last backup is not lost. </font></p>

                    Walter Gould, Network Administrator, of FSR Inc., realized that<br>
                    anyone could, accidentally or otherwise, delete all of the data files<br>
                    at any time and they would have to restore the data from tape which<br>
                    would cause them to lose everything done since the back up. He<br>
                    stated, &quot;Undelete cures that worry. Three days after I installed<br>
                    Undelete, I was preparing files for a company catalog on CD and I<br>
                    accidentally deleted several folders over the network. Without<br>
                    Undelete, I would have lost half a day figuring out what I lost and<br>
                    replacing those files. I believe in Undelete and I think Undelete<br>
                    should be on every server where data loss isn't an option.&quot; </font></p>

                    an agreement with Scarlet Telecom, one of the largest telecom suppliers in the Benelux,
                    for the delivery of 20.500 Integrated Access Devices (IAD). <br>
                    <br>
                    The agreement involves a Voice Integrated Access Device that is capable of providing
                    VoATM, ADSL Annex A and Annex B on a single board. Using Allied Data&#146;s VoDSL IAD,
                    Scarlet positions itself as a supplier of combined voice and data enabling customers to
                    have a telephone conversation by means of an ADSL-broadband connection.<br>
                    <br>
                    &#145;Scarlet targets this product at calling and surfing use over a single line, making
                    it possible now in the Netherlands and Belgium to switch over to Scarlet entirely without
                    having to change phone numbers&#146;, says Marijn de Jong, COO of Scarlet Telecom.
                    &#145;Allied Data Technologies is for Scarlet THE partner because of their continuous
                    development in the field of VoDSL and because they are the VoDSL market leader in the
                    Benelux.&#146; <br>
                    <br>

                    using intelligent web search algorithm, returning the results in ussual internet-style,
                    with text portions, quotations, highlighting, etc. It doesn't analyze YOU and your hidden

                    performance.<br>
                    <br>
                    As networks at mid-sized companies become more complex, it becomes<br>
                    increasingly critical that network and IT managers are able to<br>
                    continuously monitor the status of network devices, security events<br>
                    and service performance levels. However, network management products<br>
                    designed for large enterprises typically overburden medium-sized<br>
                    businesses with complexity and high administrative costs. Ipswitch<br>
                    WhatsUp Professional provides these organizations with a<br>
                    comprehensive, easy to implement and easy to use network management<br>
                    solution.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Computing networks have become increasingly dynamic, so businesses<br>
                    should look for a network monitoring solution that's able to<br>
                    immediately contribute to the management of that growing and critical<br>
                    business resource,&quot; said Dennis Drogseth, vice president at analyst<br>
                    firm Enterprise Management Associates. &quot;Ipswitch WhatsUp<br>
                    Professional's flexible architecture delivers alerts, performance and<br>
                    health information for a broader range of devices with much enhanced<br>
                    network services. Mid-sized businesses and enterprise departments<br>
                    require this combination of easy deployment and effective monitoring<br>
                    to maintain productivity.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Key Ipswitch WhatsUp Professional features include:<br>
                    <br>
                    Detailed monitoring and customizable network topography: SNMP SmartScan,<br>
                    ICMP discovery or Host File imports automatically provide a customizable<br>
                    network map. Monitoring has been completely rearchitected in WhatsUp<br>
                    Professional and runs as a Windows(R) service separate from the user's<br>
                    monitoring console. A new Explorer-style interface enables easy navigation,<br>
                    and centralized polling eliminates the amount of network traffic needed to<br>
                    monitor the network. Ipswitch WhatsUp Professional offers superior<br>
                    monitoring of device status, service availability, Windows events, SNMP<br>
                    traps and much more.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enhanced monitoring and alerting: Intelligent alerts -- such as maintenance<br>
                    identification, SNMP Trap forwarding and customized alerts by device or<br>
                    service -- enable IT managers to eliminate false notifications and to take<br>
                    corrective action based on the type of problem detected.<br>
                    <br>
                    Secure remote access: Users may choose from either a new integrated Web<br>
                    server and/or the Microsoft(R) IIS to access network status and information<br>
                    from any Internet-enabled device. New 128-bit SSL encryption and user<br>
                    authentication options address increased security demands.<br>
                    <br>
                    Scalable data storage and integrated reporting: SQL database support<br>
                    provides easy access to large amounts of asset information for management<br>
                    and reporting capabilities. Fully integrated and customizable HTML reports<br>
                    on devices, service availability and network performance help identify<br>
                    brewing network threats before they become problems.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;In developing Ipswitch WhatsUp Professional, Ipswitch focused on<br>
                    delivering both ease of use and completeness in a thoroughly updated<br>

                    Westmoreland, vice president of R&amp;D, Ipswitch, Inc. &quot;Extensive<br>
                    pre-release usability and the experience gained from the 40,000<br>
                    networks monitored by WhatsUp Gold have resulted in a new standard<br>
                    for network monitoring products. We are confident users will<br>

                    of version 4.0 of<br>
                    its popular software. Xingtone now supports all major US carriers,<br>
                    including Verizon Wireless. The new application empowers more<br>
                    wireless subscribers than ever before with the ability to create<br>
                    ringtones from their own music and audio library and upload them to<br>

                    &quot;We drive users and traffic to these expensive, advanced networks,&quot;<br>
                    said Jonathan Schreiber, CEO of Xingtone. &quot;The market should be<br>
                    flooded with entrepreneurs like us who can transform wireless<br>
                    networks into independent economies. With Xingtone as part of the<br>
                    equation, music labels sell more music, carriers adopt more<br>
                    subscribers and fill their pipes, and consumers have more freedom --<br>
                    everyone should love Xingtone.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Version 4.0 includes advanced audio editing features that make it<br>
                    even easier to make personal ringtones perfect. In addition to adding<br>
                    normalization, cross fades, and clipping, users can now record their<br>

                    4.0 also expands the number of importable audio formats to WMA, Ogg<br>

                    <br>
                    Everyone agrees that &quot;peer to peer&quot; (&quot;P2P&quot;) technology has the
                    potential <br>
                    to revolutionize the way we share information, but most people also see it <br>
                    as the &quot;bad boy&quot; of software. It's an attractive and powerful technology <br>
                    but has a reputation for being risky and unreliable. Many people have found<br>
                    P2P file sharing has lured them into bad online neighborhoods where<br>
                    they are ambushed by viruses, adware, spyware, popups, porn, and even<br>
                    lawsuits.<br>
                    <br>
                    Laplink has solved these problems with ShareDirect, a safe, secure,<br>
                    and reliable method for sharing information across a controlled<br>
                    network of authenticated users with their newest product,<br>
                    ShareDirect.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Simply put, we think ShareDirect is P2P the way it should be,&quot; says<br>
                    Thomas Koll, CEO of Laplink Software, Inc. &quot;It's a utility that is<br>
                    powerful and flexible enough for businesses of any size or<br>
                    configuration, but simple enough for personal use. We retained the<br>
                    strength and functionality of 'peer to peer' connectivity, and made<br>
                    it secure, safe, and supported. We want to show PC users that 'peer<br>
                    to peer' technology is a powerful solution that can be used without<br>
                    fear.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    ShareDirect allows you to leverage the power and control of direct<br>
                    folder-to-folder connectivity to create your own instant,<br>
                    personalized file sharing networks with colleagues, clients, friends<br>
                    or family directly from Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows 2003<br>
                    using File Manager (Windows Explorer).<br>
                    <br>
                    ShareDirect is a true &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; file-sharing and collaboration<br>
                    solution that provides instant connectivity, advanced antivirus<br>
                    protection, and 256-bit encryption. Installation takes about 5<br>
                    minutes, and because it is integrated into familiar Windows File<br>
                    Manager controls, mastering the simple program takes only a few<br>
                    minutes to. ShareDirect instantly transforms your File Manager into a<br>
                    powerful and secure peer-to-peer application.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I like that ShareDirect lets you create a private, authenticated<br>
                    network in minutes,&quot; says David S. Marshak, Senior VP of the Patricia<br>
                    Seybold Group. &quot;The folder-to-folder connection gives users complete<br>
                    control and flexibility in terms of the files they share and the<br>
                    people they share them with. And the unlimited download and upload<br>
                    capabilities available in the service make this a powerful<br>
                    application of the P2P networking concept.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Mike Paston discovered that ShareDirect is a logical choice for the<br>
                    health care industry because of its enhanced security. Paston,<br>
                    Program Director of AeroCare Medical Transport Inc. (AMTi), an air<br>
                    ambulance service based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, describes the benefits of<br>
                    ShareDirect software by saying, &quot;Using ShareDirect to transfer<br>
                    patient files, I am confident that their private information is<br>
                    protected during the transfer process. At the same time, I'm<br>
                    confident we are compliant with government privacy regulations.&quot; He<br>
                    continues, &quot;Most importantly, I know those files will be available in<br>
                    a timely manner. In my business, every minute counts. ShareDirect's<br>
                    instant and secure file transfer brings me peace of mind.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    ShareDirect is available in a variety of subscription plans<br>
                    (&quot;Editions&quot;) designed to meet the needs of personal, professional,<br>
                    small business and corporate users. Annual fees range from $39.95<br>
                    for the Basic Edition to $249.95 for the Corporate Edition, which<br>
                    provides 3GB/month of Premium Service. Premium Service ensures that<br>
                    you can share your folders through nearly all firewalls and routers<br>
                    with absolutely no user configuration. And if users can establish<br>
