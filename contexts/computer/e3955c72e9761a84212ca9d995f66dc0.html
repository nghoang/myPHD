A <i>computer black screen</i> on start up is a challenge for me and I always try to trouble shoot the problem manually, without using those fancy programs, because I believe it is the only way to learn.</p>
<p>There are two types of computer black screens that can appear in Windows. One where the computer will not boot up but you have a beep sequence sounding to let you know what the problem could be, and the other has nothing at all. No beeps, no cursor, no logo screen, and no choice to boot to safe mode or access the bios.</p>
<p>If your computer will not boot up and you get a beep sequence, I am not saying it is good news, however it is a step in the right direction towards solving this problem. This is a message from your computer that can be understood by looking up your bios (the brand) beep code. For example you may have an Award Bios, Ami Bios, Phoenix BIOS, Compaq, Dell, or Acer Bios. This list goes on and on.  You can search for Bios beep codes in Google. Here is an example of results in Google search <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4ADBS_enAU318AU318&amp;q=bios+beep+code" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Search results for &#8220;bios beep codes&#8221;</a></p>
<p>If you heard a single beep, then the computer posted, and the CPU is OK. POST= <strong>Power On Self Test </strong> A procedure the computer goes through on starting to ensure all is well.</p>
<p>When your computer has a black screen in windows, and absolutely nothing else, this is where the challenge begins. Sometimes the fans and the CPU seems to be running.</p>
<p>When this happens to me, I have an instant advantage as I have a replacement part for basically any computer component at my fingertips. I also have a magic boot disc that repairs missing files on my hard drive and will <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=277096&amp;u=450974&amp;m=7842&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=" rel="nofollow">boot up any computer, fix and install Windows easy.</a> If you do not have any of these tools then you will need to try and find the errors manually.</p>
<h1>Common things that can happen when your computer has a black screen in Windows:</h1>
<ul>
<li>When the computer will not boot up, it sound like it is booting as the CPU fan is running and the lights are on. It also finds the CD ROM but it won&#8217;t boot from a CD either.</li>
<li>Sometimes when you have a <u>computer black screen</u> on startup and the power switch light will be green and then turns to orange or amber. Everything is running.</li>
<li>Everything seems to be running but you can&#8217;t see anything on the screen, not even a flashing cursor. Your black screen in Windows has occurred before the Windows logo screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://tips4pc.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/black-screen2.gif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5555" title="black screen2" src="http://tips4pc.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/black-screen2-300x187.gif" alt="computer black screen"width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Some common causes of a computer black screen in Windows:</strong></h2>
<p>I have to be honest, there are literally hundred&#8217;s of reasons why your computer might have a black screen. Hopefully your problem will be something relatively basic. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you see the screen that tells you your computer had an error, do not choose to start normally, choose to start in safe mode now. See <a href="http://tips4pc.com/articles/computer%20troubleshooting/why_do_i_need_safe_mode_and_what.htm">what is safe mode</a>. This is your chance to go the safe way. Many people rush and press to start Windows normally and sometimes this causes a serious problem. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h3>Where is your Monitor plugged in? &#8220;My computer screen is black&#8221;</h3>
<p>The first and most obvious reason for a computer appearing to run but you cannot see the video is the monitor. A common mistake is to plug the monitor into the on-board video plug when you actually have a PCI or AGP video card installed. Trust me I have done this myself. Simply move the plug to the correct position. If you see two blue monitor plugs at the back of the computer or even a blue plug and a HDMI port then try using a different plug.</p>
<p>Obviously you should also check to see if the monitor plugged is actually in firmly. It could have been knocked out if it was not correctly positioned in the first place. This is the simplest computer black screen you can get.</p>
<h3><strong>Failing Display adapter or video card</strong> can cause a black screen in windows:</h3>
<p lang="en-US">Most of the time you can tell if your computer video card is deteriorating by seeing little tell tale signs. Lines appearing or flashing can sometimes occur, however sometimes nothing happens at all. You might turn your computer on and have the dreaded black screen. You can try removing your video card and using onboard video, or replacing the video card to see if that is the problem.</p>
<p lang="en-US">People often also see a computer black screen when they have plugged their computer into a different monitor or even a TV where the screen resolution is not compatible. If it is a simple black screen on your computer it can also be a simple problem to fix, but unfortunately people do not realize this problem and start troubleshooting, which actually gives the computer are serious black screen. When I know that my computer is showing a <em><strong>black screen</strong></em> on my Windows computer and I know that I have just connected it to a different monitor, I immediately restart and press F8. This will take me to the the menu where I will choose enable VGA mode or something similar.</p>
<h3><strong>The next reason the </strong>computer will not boot up<strong> is RAM</strong>&#8230;or memory:</h3>
<p>This can be the cause when your computer has a <em>black screen in Windows</em>.</p>
<p>If your memory is not seated properly (not in), is damaged, or even absent altogether, this can cause a black screen.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have no memory installed at all, some computers make no sounds and just show a <strong>black screen on startup</strong>. Other computers go crazy and beep their head off. I am an expert at this one, as I build so my computers.</li>
<li>When your computer gets a black screen only sometimes, it usually means your ram is on the way out..For example if you boot your computer and it doesn&#8217;t work, then go back an hour later, and it does work, your memory is playing up. You can try taking the ram out, gently cleaning it with an antistatic cloth, and replacing it. This may solve your problem. If it does not, then you should try running your computer with another compatible stick of ram installed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you plan to open your computer case and remove the ram please read these articles on how to <a title="How To Open Computer Cases Safely" href="http://tips4pc.com/articles/computer%20maintenance/how_to_open_a_computer_case_safe.htm">open computer cases</a> safely and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tips4pc.com/articles/computer%20maintenance/upgrade_your_computer_memory.htm" target="_top">Upgrade Memory</a> </span></p>
<h3><strong>Black screen on startup with an amber flashing light</strong></h3>
<p>A flashing amber light along with your black screen on startup can be a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not enough power getting to the motherboard.</li>
<li>A dead power supply.</li>
<li>A bent pin or shorted out USB port causing a problem.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Computer black screen after installing new hardware</strong></h3>
<p>Often when computer users install hardware in order to upgrade their own computers they run into problems. If you have just performed an upgrade and then get a black screen, the answer is obvious. Some hardware components may not be compatible with the others in your system. And of course there is always the risk of static electricity damaging your components when you are not an experienced computer repair person.</p>
<p>You might just be installing a new piece of RAM but the best way to troubleshoot this is to go back to where you started from. Always start from the beginning. If your computer was working and you installed something, then take it back out. Think about what you are doing and try again.</p>
<p>This has nothing to with getting a black screen in Windows, as sometimes you have not even installed Windows yet. The hardware must be compatible together and also must be installed correctly.<a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=224223&amp;u=450974&amp;m=7842&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" src="http://www.shareasale.com/image/7842/300X250.jpg" alt="Boot up any computer  restore your Windows and Data" border="0" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Leaving a bootable usb flash drive connected to your computer</strong></h3>
<p>Yes this can confuse your computer and it won&#8217;t know where to boot up. When your computer has a black screen on startup from doing this and you realize this is the problem and remove the USB, the computer just continues to boot normally..this sometimes happens because a computer sometimes recognizes a USB as a CD drive and tries to boot to it. This is the easiest cause of a black screen in Windows as you can simply just take it out and restart your computer.</p>
<h3><strong>Corrupting the Boot Sector</strong></h3>
<p>A <em>black screen on startup</em> can be so many things! I have learned this lesson the hard way. Never turn off the computer when it is half way through the boot procedure. Even when it is taking forever, or having a major problem you must let it run through if possible. Interrupting it once may be ok, but twice or three times is a no no. After you have carelessly restarted and shutdown a few times the black screen may appear. But this time it may be beyond repair for the average computer user. <a href="http://tips4pc.com/articles/computer%20troubleshooting/how_to_repair_a_damaged_boot_sec.htm" target="_top">How to repair a damaged boot sector by replacing the master boot record (MBR) in Windows XP</a></p>
<h3>Black screen on startup<strong> &#8211; Your CPU is not correctly seated</strong></h3>
<p>If your computer has a black screen after transporting one place to another, this is the first place I look. Transporting a working computer, and then not working with a black screen = dislodging the CPU. You can fix this easily by removing the CPU fan and carefully replacing it back in its spot. You may also have to replace some thermal paste between the cpu and heat sink as it stops the cpu from overheating. Be very careful not to bend any pins when dealing with your computer CPU.</p>
<h3><strong>Keyboard Faulty</strong></h3>
<p lang="en-US">This one surprised me because when there is a problem with the keyboard the computer still boots and says that there is no keyboard detected on the screen. Well this didn&#8217;t happen for me. I had a keyboard with a bent pin on the cable, so when it was plugged into the computer, it just plugged in normally. Then the computer black screen on startup appeared, you could here it starting up but no posting beeps, no display, nothing. I even swapped monitors around until finally I tested the keyboard and found the bent pin. I never thought to look there because of the usual default message that appears on the screen when there is something wrong with your keyboard. This is why having a black screen in Windows as a crazy amount of causes and solutions. I really did not expect this one to come out of the woodwork.</p>
<h3>Corrupted User Account &#8211; Computer Boots to Black Screen</h3>
<p>If you have logged into Windows, so you actually saw the login screen, then logged into Windows, this can mean a few different things. One is that it can be a corrupted user account. In this case it would be handy to have another user account to login to. Then you would be able to tell straight away if that was the problem or not. If you can log into another account you will be able to access the corrupted user account through the main hard drive which is usually called C: drive. You will see a folder called &#8220;users&#8221; and then there will be another folder for the actual username.</p>
<p>If you are using windows XP than the files are in the Document and Settings section.</p>
<h2 lang="en-US"><strong>Notes relating to your computer black screen in Windows:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>If your computer has black screen but you can see one small flashing cursor, I see this as a good sign! It usually means your computer is ok to be formatted. It can also mean that you should try to repair the boot sector first. <a href="http://tips4pc.com/articles/computer%20troubleshooting/how_to_repair_a_damaged_boot_sec.htm" target="_top">How to repair a damaged boot sector by replacing the master boot record (MBR) in Windows XP</a></li>

<p>Hi, I have a USB wireless Internet &#8216;stick&#8217; ah, thing. Of I leave my computerworld go to sleep, when I try to use it again, the Internet has disconnected. When I try to reconnect it however, it often won&#8217;t recognize that it&#8217;s plugged in and I have to turn the stick off and unplug it. Immediately after I unplug the USB my laptop blue screens every single time. Last night it did this and after my computer had restarted and gotten onto the desktop I turned it off by holding the button in as I couldn&#8217;t be bothered and decided to leave it turned off. Tonight when I turned my computer on, it comes up with the &#8216;start windows&#8217; normally or in safe mode and I selected normally. It loads all the way through the windows (vista) startup, but as soon as it is about to loa my desktop the screen goes black with just a cursor that is not flashing and I can move it around. Have tried numerous times to restart as use safe mode (safe mode works), and have unplugged the USB Internet and all other USB and the power source but my computer will not load past that screen. Ctrl alt delete doesn&#8217;t work. Pleeeeeeease tell me there is something I can do :/</p>

<p>hi<br />
I have an old desktop pc .some times ago when i wanted to start it, it would start up 1 trough 10 times.and in the other cases, when It wanted to load windows xp screen, suddenly the monitor would go on stand by mode and just the orange led would be turn on.I thought the problem is with windows so I reinstall win  Xp.but not only it didnt correct.but also it didnt work 1 trough 10 for ever.now I have installed a win 98.now it pass the windows loading page.but when it start and want to configure a hardware (I think VGA card) the problem appear and monitor go on stand by.I forget to say that when the monitor go on stand by the reset key and power key on case both will be unable and the only way to turning computer off is to unplug it.I should mention that in safe mode I can boot computer.</p>

<p>Hi Miss Mitz,<br />
I have a major computer problem.  I am at Princeton University for a summer program, and I need my laptop for classes.  OK, I came to campus, and my computer was working fine, though it was a little slow.  Then, three days after being on campus, in the afternoon I went to  go use my computer for the second time during that day.  I turned it on, and it was extremely slow, but I finally reached the log-on screen.  So I logged on to my user account, and all I have is a black screen with a cursor in the middle, my computer lights are all working, though my computer fan doesn&#8217;t seem to be running constantly, and its quite cold.  I am asking all around Princeton for help, but no one seems to know what the problem is.  I could really  need your help, as I need to use my laptop for classes ASAP.  Thank you so much, any advice would be helpful and greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a toshiba laptop and i just reset it to factory settings yesterday morning because it got infected after a friend tried to install stuff on it off his jump drive. The reset went smooth and i downloaded chrome and used it that night to surf around. I left for work at 10pm and left it on no programs running and when i came back it was just a black screen. I have a cursor but it doesnt respond to cntrl alt del.<br />
I powered it down an restarted it and it gave me the two options to fix or start normally. If i choose fix it loads a little bit then back to the black screen with the cursor. If i hit start normal it tries then reboots itself back to the same two options, fix or start normal. I tried booting in safemode with f8 and that brought me to the black screen to. Any ideas?</p>

<p>There are a few fixes for this&#8230;Your hard drive is not plugged in correctly&#8230;Usually a sata connection&#8230;Also you might need to connect to a different plug on the motherboard&#8230;It could also mean you have to change your boot priority in the bios&#8230;Try these few things and let me know if anything works.. you should possibily be formatting as you have had an infection??</p>

<p>Hello, so, I have an issue.<br />
I log into my computer (windows vista; acer) and everything&#8217;s fine. Everything&#8217;s showing. But then, I log into my computer account, and all I see is black, and the cursor. I&#8217;ve tried everything. The noises from my actual computer are working, then blue light on my screen is on. I really don&#8217;t see what the problem is?<br />
Before this all happened, I downloaded &#8220;Norton free 90 day trial&#8221;. I let it install, then it said to restart my computer to fix the virus that I had. So, I did. Then this disaster happened.<br />
What do I do? I really need this computer for school.<br />
Thank-You!</p>

<p>Log into another user account and see if that works&#8230;If it does you know that the user account is corrupted..<br />
You can go into safe mode and see if you can get in that way to reverse changes&#8230;<br />
You could also use the OS CD to get to system restore or repair.</p>

<p>My computer does not give a complete black screen, it gives me the message of no boot device. The weird thing is that after reset, keyboard or button, it starts ok. </p>
<p>This happens every single time since a week ago.  The hdd is a new WD 2 terra. I used it for a week to back up the old data, next disconnected the old one. It worked fine few days, and suddenly start doing  this joke on me. </p>
<p>I  have a decade experience in broking computers, especially hdd&#8217;s, and this kind of behavior is quite a novelty.  Mobo is M2N-CM DVI  about 3 years old.</p>

<p>Hmm maybe there is a fault with your hard drive&#8230; What about the bios settings? Did you change anything there or check them to see if it is picking up your hard drive. </p>

<p>Yes, my computer is moody <img src='http://tips4pc.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  at first does  not like 2 terra, but at second thought accepts it.</p>
<p>I do not find any logic in this. Is not big news, it happens often that my computers defies logic. <img src='http://tips4pc.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I disabled cd as first boot, problem is still here. </p>
<p>I think I just found a logic, the new hdd is on sata2, it is seen ok in bios, but somehow, at fresh boot bios goes to sata1,  so I need to change the connectors inside, but this seems kind of bios bug. Other weird explanation, is that somehow at fresh boot still has the old bios setting, and at reset is clears. The first ghost of a bios in history <img src='http://tips4pc.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Anyway, I will postpone tests and go on reset for a while because testing may prove disastrous.  Just before I wrote here I tested the button reset just a second after power up, and the computer powered down. At power up again started, but powered down after a second. this thing repeated few times. I was afraid I fried my bios or source, I tried something ilogic, I mean unplugged the computer, waited few seconds, plugged back in and started as usual with no boot device, reset from keyboard. I  will not touch again the reset button after poering the computer.</p>

<p>The blue screen means there was a problem&#8230;however now black..<br />
First thing I would do is go into bios and check your boot options&#8230; Turn off everything else and only boot to hard drive&#8230;Turn off cd or dvd drive. </p>
<p>I guess you are hearing a beep to show the computer wen through POST? </p>

<p>Hi MITZ,</p>
<p>this black screen issue is killing me. If I turn off the computer for a while (say overnight), the next morning I try to boot it up again,:<br />
Boot 1: there will be no display whatsoever, -&gt; I press the restart button<br />
Boot 2: Display on monitor past windows 7 loading screen then stuck at a black screen without cursor or anything. -&gt; I press the restart button<br />
Boot 3: Just have to select boot normally and everything goes fine.<br />
This trend is so consistent its crazy. Greatly appreciate your help.</p>
<p>*I am booting on a usb-wireless keyboard with a new pci-e graphics card that wasnt giving me such a problem until one fine day. I am not sure if it could be due to the windows updates like i read somewhere. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi i turned off my sony vaio computer (laptop) last night and when i tried to turn it on again it started the booting up process but too extremely long and just b4 windows loaded the black screen came on. This happens even when i try to start my computer in safe mode or any other mode. It just says starting windows and the red, green yellow and blue logo, after about an hour the screen goes totally black and the cursor shows and you are able to move it but no other function.</p>

<p>Hardware: Novatech desktop, MS-7366 (V1.X) motherboard, Core 2 Duo CPU, 2GB RAM, NVidia 9600GT with latest driver updates, 400w PSU, no printer, (sometimes run a Western Digital &#8216;Passport&#8217; external HD for backups but not connected at first instance of black screen (and not connected since)), Edimax WiFi ariel via USB, no extra fitted soundcard.<br />
Software: Vista Home Premium with latest updates, no third-party games, IE7 &amp; Firefox 4, Panasonic&#8217;s &#8216;PhotoFun5&#8242; photo editor.</p>
<p>All has been ok for the last 18mth and no new hardware, software or updates installed, that haven&#8217;t worked for the past week without problems. Switched on this morning, only to be greeted by the dreaded black screen and no beeps. Checked the all the cables and all is as was yesterday afternoon, when all was running ok. The fans were going and I let it run for 45mins but resorted to a hard-reset. On the next try, I got a single beep but nothing more. I don&#8217;t know what Bios I have, so can&#8217;t check-out the Bios Beep Codes.</p>
<p>Left for over an hour and still no joy. On another try, tried F8 for 30mins and this time got no beep and nothing more. The monitor reports that there is no signal and the keyboard light is on. The computer has not been moved or bumped and I&#8217;m the only one who has access to said computer. I&#8217;ve not got a restore disc and none was supplied with the computer. I&#8217;ll be contacting original vendor for a restore disc and will let you know what happens&#8230; if anything. But at the moment, I&#8217;m at a loss for ideas.

<p>I have an HP P4 machine that dies when XP loads.  I can boot the Ultimate boot CD and run CPU Burn in or Memory tests just fine and it does not die.  The hard drive test in the BIOS says the hard drive is OK</p>
<p>When you try to boot to XP, it loads, but then the monitor goes black, but the PC&#8217;s fans are still running.  I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s a corrupt OS.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi, I&#8217;ve got an hp laptop and the last couple of weeks while I&#8217;m on it the screen will go black with vertical and horizontal flasing lines. I would restart and all would go back to normal.  Last night I did a quick scan (Norton) and straight after the screen did it again.  I restarted and the black screen with the lines came up straight away.  I switched the laptop off and left it for 2 hours. When I switched it on again it did the same thing.  I can&#8217;t use it at all now.  Is this a virus or something else?<br />

<p>It is a common thing for Laptop Screens to die. It sounds like yours did because it had lines. If there really isn&#8217;t a clear problem other than that, than I say it is your laptop screen.<br />

<p>Hi Mitz!</p>
<p>First of all, what a great thread you made!!<br />
Now, let me tell you what happened to my laptop. Hope you can advise me. Everything at boot was working fine, i entered windows xp(not a very recent laptop) and everything ok. Suddenly at statup, i got a message telling that the CMOS Battery was low and I&#8217;m not sure if the message also said to change the CMOS Battery, or to got to bios and adjust the correct time and date. Nevertheless i went to BIOS(its an AMI BIOS in an Alienware Area 51m 766 laptop that&#8217;s a 2004 model!!) and adjusterd the right time and date. I also configured to get a Bios access password as a hardisk password(as I had before, and I think this configuration was lost because the cmos battery charge was low). After that everything worked ok. I did not changed the cmos battery yet. This message appeared sometimes, and more repetitive. I made the same configurations and everything was running ok(i could go into windows xp as before). After seeing some messages I decided to go buy and replace de CMOS battery with a new one(I guess I may have done this much earlier). So what i did was to remove the keyboard(but not disconecting it from de mobo) so i could have access to de CMOS battery(as other stuff like RAM, wifi card, etc). The CMOS battery has no cables and is easily removed with a flat screwdriver. So i removed it that way and took it to radioshack to change it for a new one. The battery type is CRxxxx something and is from Enercell(Renata battery). Bought the new battery and installed it back home. After that i power my laptop on, and nothing apeared on the screen, i cant here any beep sound eihter. The laptop behaves the same way now, nothing changed and I can´t see nothing on screen nor here any beep sound.<br />
When opening the laptop to acces de CMOS battery i always disconected it from the power cable but i confess that i did not disconected de rechargable battery(not cmos battery but the big one). I don&#8217;t know if my laptop actual state is because of a circuit-break in its components or because i leaved it a long time without the cmos battery(that&#8217;s when i took it to radioshack to buy the replacement(i was like 4 or more hours away). I guess that the AMI bios lost every configuration, but I&#8217;m not sure.<br />
Could you help me with some advice? Before i&#8217;d go to radioshack every thing was ok, and i did not do any change in the laptop but disconecte de power cable, pcmcia wireless card, removing keyboard, changing the cmos battery for the new one, securing keyboard again, conecting power cable and turn on the laptop.<br />
Sure i wrote a lot for this, but i guess that any info is helpfull to identify the problem. Any advice in how to solve it? It would be much appreciated and thanks in advanced.</p>

<p>Hi, alas my screen as sucumbed to the black screen as well. Mine went like this: I was on facebook when i clicked a friend, and then everything just froze, like not just the internet but the whole computer,could not get the start panel up or enything, so I hit the reset button on my tower, next thing i know black screen. I reset it again and it started to work, the windows logo came up and said &#8220;loading&#8221; so i waited, but then i noticed it was taking much longer then it normally would, so i reset it after 20 minutes of &#8220;loading&#8221;. I left it for a couple of hours and came back to it and still the black screen, but this time I heard noises coming from it, like the windows startup sound, then i typed in my password on the black screen and I heard it let me on my file, but the screen was still black, i reset again, this time there was a white line in the top left corner of the screen blinking, then the windows repair thing came up and said start windows normally, so i did, nothing happened but yet another black screen. This is extremly frustrating and i would love to here a fiz without having to pay for it, Thank you!</p>

Sounds like a memory problem. But what did you do with the memory. Did you just take one stick out and try one by itself?<br />

<p>I recently got my brother&#8217;s big gaming computer.  It had an aftermarket liquid cooling system installed on it to replace air cooling which got his room a bit too toasty.  Whenever I press the power button, the computer tower turns all its lights and fans on, but the mouse, keyboard, and monitor do nothing.  I must THEN boot it again, and I get stuck with an error message &#8220;Could not find CPU fan.&#8221;  I am running Vista 64bit Ultimate and have tried multiple times to get the Windows 7 conversion kit installed (and failed miserably).  The only way for one of the components to install is to have a clean restart, not botched like mine has been. ALSO, the shutdown sequence sometimes nears infinity as the giant tries to quiet down.  Any information regarding any of these topics would be FANTASTIC!<br />

<p>My laptop has the no beep, black screen issue. However every 10 seconds or so it just reboots itself and keeps that cycle going till I manually shut it down. I took it apart and tried the heatgun method, and reseat every single thing that wasn&#8217;t loose and nothing. still the same old thing. Sounds like the motherboard. What do you think? The laptop is a few years old but rarely ever used. I also tried a hard reset, removed the battery and tried straight from a plug. Any ideas what it is so I can replace it?</p>

<p>My eee pc just up and did the same thing yesterday.  I am going to tinker with h=it and I will get back to you if I have figured out anything.  In my case, I had the eeepc for 1 year now, but it is out o waranty. The problem occured yesterday morning and at one point I was able to restart the computer and it would bot normally, but within a few moments the screen would freeze and I would be forced to shutdown.  After shutting down the last time, it no longer has booted up and I will be trying a few things to hopefully diagnose or fix the problem.  It might be the LCD is broken which is unfortunately a common problem with asus, or possible the ram or some ohter hardware component, being that I was able to boot up and access info ok when it first happened.</p>

<p>Hello!<br />
I have a pentium III computer (yes it is old but it&#8217;s my desktop I dont use much) and it is nothing but a black screen,  will not turn off and when I say will not turn off I mean WILL NOT TURN OFF!  I literally unplugged it and plugged it back into the power source and it was still running.  I tried everything.  I even tried holding down the power button for 5 minutes and nothing still happened. What&#8217;s going on here?</p>
<p>Thank you a head of time!</p>

<p>When i started my emachine acer em350 this morning it<br />
was not typing properly. First of all, on the XP login screen, when I tried to type anything, instead of one character (or dot, in the password space), the entire space is filled up with that one character up until the character limit. For example, I press &#8216;R&#8217; on my keyboard, instead of &#8216;R&#8217; showing up on screen, something like &#8216;RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&#8230; &#8216; showed up.</p>
<p>I tried taking the battery out and now all i am getting is a black screen, i can hear the power is on the fans are running and i have a blue light on the power button, but the power button is not turning it off, i have to take the battery to get it to power off.</p>
<p>I was on the internet last night and turned it off normally.</p>

<p>This just happened to me when accidentally hit standby in XP.  Boot drive MBR and DOS boot partition were corrupted, along with the motherboard BIOS.  I was in process of underclocking a 9800 GT video adapter with nTune and RivaTune, and thought that may have been corrupted as well.  Fortunately, the machine would boot when powered down/up or when restarted from DOS, but would not do a &#8220;warm boot&#8221;/restart from XP. Also fortunately, everything had been backed up.  </p>
<p>Restoring the MBR and boot partition cleaned up some multi-boot problems (still use BootMagic), but the black screen XP restart remained until re-flashed (not reset, not restore defaults, but FULL RE-FLASH from floppy) of the motherboard BIOS.  System is stable after that. </p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

<p>A bit more info &#8212;  on the multi-boot system, the problem also occurred with warm-boot restart attempts from Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit partitions on a separate physical drive.  The common denominator was either the video or mobo BIOS, or a hardware failure.  In my case, it was the mobo BIOS.</p>
<p>Several internet posts link standby problems with ACPI settings.  Checked the BIOS, and default ACPI setting powers down all except memory (including the video card) on standby.  This may have triggered the problem in the first place.  Set it only stop CPU activity (leaving video card powered up) to hopefully avoid problem in future.</p>
<p>Word to the wise:  if you have a VGA adapter card, save an image of the card&#8217;s BIOS (using nVidia&#8217;s nFlash or similar) and your motherboard BIOS before you do any tweaking.  BIOS images are keyed to particular manufacturers and models, and may not be readily available from your manufacturer or sites like TechPowerUp.  Keep data on a separate partition so that you can restore your OS partition without losing it.  Good old Ghost 2003 (DOS version) works perfectly for me.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mitz for this thread.  It is a great help in solving a difficult problem.  The points made and comments here helped me to resolve my case.</p>

<p>Which part of the computer are you putting in the freezer? Usually when you have a bad hard drive and you want to get the data off it you can put it in the freezer and it will be okay to use for about 20 min.</p>

<p>i have a similar problem. like a week ago, i was loading my ipod and it kept turning off my computer. so my friend and i decided to fix it, but during the fix the computer went berserk. then i saw a AVG sign saying i was in threat of a danger. the computer went into a blue screen while it was synching. i took out the ipod and turned it off. after that ever since then when i start up my computer it sees the computer brand and proceeds to the black screen. no cursor, nothing. My friend believes its the AVG problem with windows vista and my father believes its the hard drive. i dont know what to do, can you guys help me?</p>

<p>I am thinking that you have damaged the boot sector on your hard drive. This will stop Windows from loading or even seeing a sign of it.<br />
If you have an operating system CD, I would put it in and do a repair.<br />
Depending on what version of Windows you have it will repair the computer for you.<br />
However if it is the boot sector of your hard drive which makes it a bootable device, then you need to get to a command prompt in order to repair this.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks so much for this guide.  I think I have a problem not previously covered, though I have not gone through all the comments.  I have an Asus Eee PC that was working perfectly and suddenly &#8220;died&#8221; while I was using it &#8211; the screen suddenly went blank.  Now when I try to turn it on, the power button lights up but I have a black, empty screen, and the fan doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s working.  I&#8217;ve done a hard reset (taking out battery and unplugging, pushing power button for 30 sec, then plugging back in), but I can&#8217;t think of anything else to try.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Lia. I just bought an Eee PC, and within 8 hours of having it, it presented this exact problem. I immediately got an RMA from Newegg, and it is being replaced. You are the first person on the internets that I found to have the same problem as me and I&#8217;ve been searching high and low. I would like to know how to fix this so I don&#8217;t have this problem again in the future. I have a 1215T Eee PC. I&#8217;ve tried resetting it as well, and nothing. It just powers on, no post and the hard drive whirls down after several seconds. I hope this isn&#8217;t a major issues with the Eee PC&#8217;s cause I don&#8217;t want to have to deal with this again. I hope you and I get an answer.. <img src='http://tips4pc.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Thanks for your tips. I just opened some covers on the back of my laptop, and made sure all parts were tightly fastened, and then my computer were back to normal again from being black screen. Just like something never occurred. It was magic. Thanx also Microsoft for Windows 7.</p>

<p>My desktop switched to &#8220;power save mode&#8221; suddenly. After a couple of restarts I was able to get into BIOS and reset the original configurations and start up windows normally. After a few hours it was back to &#8220;power save mode&#8221; and now when I turn on my pc there&#8217;s only a lonely blank screen. I tried switching around my RAM, cleaning the inside, resetting my agp video card, resetting CMOS, switching power cables, pressing any and all buttons but nothing seems to work. I can hear the fans running and I can see the keyboard light up when I power up but after that, nothing. Can somebody please help?</p>

<p>Can you get into bios still? It sounds like you have a problem with either your internal battery on the motherboard ie near dead&#8230;or you have a monitor cable not in right or some confusion there. Check all cables and display cards for good connection.<br />

<p>Thanks Mitz for responding. I am only able to access bios by chance it seems like, because i&#8217;ve hit all the bios command keys and nothing seems to work it just sometimes appears after i&#8217;ve restarted my pc a number of times. I have also switched cables and made sure they are all in correctly but still nothing and I tried removing the cmos battery for 30 sec but still nothing.</p>

<p>Hmm sounds interesting! An amber light can mean a power issue. Power supplies can die after not being used or moved around. The next bad news is that it could be your motherboard. Hopefully a bad connection or bent pin..but sometimes worse!<br />

<p>Anyone have any suggestions for a lightly-technical person to try and diagnose a &#8216;Black Screen&#8217; issue I am having.</p>
<p>We purchased an ASUS less than a year ago and when we went to turn it on last week it has a &#8216;Black Screen&#8217;&#8230; No blinking cursor, just black.  I see control lights on the keyboard and can hear the fan running, nothing else.</p>
<p>We have Windows 7 and shouldn&#8217;t have any RAM issues.  Anything I can try?</p>

<p>Hi Keith<br />
It sounds like there was a screen resolution conflict but I am not sure if incorrect shut could have caused something else now&#8230;</p>
<p>You can try &#8220;holding the F8 key while booting your PC and select &#8221; Enable VGA Mode&#8221;<br />

<p>I got the BSoD twice in one day on my Sony Vaio FW, so i backed everything up on an external hard drive, unplugged the hard drive, and restored the C: Drive. The restore went successfully, until the Boot-up, when i go the VAIO logo, but then the screen went black, with no cursor, no sound. Is this just because I unplugged the HD, so that it couldn&#8217;t restore my files?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>Why do you say the restore went well? Was there a message saying it was successful? </p>
<p>Also did you just do a Windows system restore? </p>
<p>Having the hard drive not plugged in should be ok&#8230;as it only has files you backed up&#8230;.Or were you actually restoring from there?</p>

<p>I had one computer come up with the black screen.  It was old and we decided to replace it.  When I got the second computer all was fine.  I did put my old hard drive as a secondary drive into the new computer.  All was fine for weeks and now it is doing exactly as the first.  It will not boot.  No beeps when I turn it on.  I unplugged the second hard drive and still nothing.  What could be causing this?</p>

<p>hi Nick,<br />
I do not think it is a graphics display problem because you were using your Laptop when it froze and the system was not shut down properly. This simple reason can cause files to become corrupt because they were not packed away in time.</p>
<p>You said that you logged in to 1 account and then had a black screen. Therefore this means that you got to the login screen of Windows. So use saw this screen and you typed in the pass word, is this correct?</p>
<p>If this did happen, and you could do this again, I would press CTRL ALT DEL to try and bring up task manager. Then I would start a new process called &#8220;explorer.exe&#8221;</p>
<p>Have you tried booting into safe mode?<br />

<p>Hi! This site is very good but unfortunately I still fail to identify the problem. I own a dell(a quite old model) and after i dropped it on the floor the screen light just went darker and darker and for a while I saw nothing but now I can see, but one vey weak because the screen light is off. I can still log on, allthough sometimes when I try the screen is dark and the text &#8220;1 user1&#8243; appeares on the screen and when I it a button it beeps. So there is no POST codes or anything. What can I do?</p>

<p>Hi Elsa,<br />
Dropping your laptop does not help! Obviously there could be any number of problems caused by this. One of them might be that you have ruined your laptop screen. You can test this out by connecting your laptop to a computer screen or TV that allows computer connections. If your laptop boots up normally when plugged in to another monitor then you know it is the screen that needs to be replaced.<br />

<p>After I switch on my Sony Vaio laptop it starts but screen is blank. Doing control alt delete I can see all processes are running. In time about 20 m icons and task bar begin to appear while the connected to net icon the last to appear. Then lap top works fine. (Some time if I am switching it off says hibernating mode.) This happened after I bought a top of the range roller in flight bag that was well stacked so I am reluctant to believe it may be the cause. How to rectify it?</p>

<p>Hi PED,<br />
Instead of waiting 20 min you can press CTRL ALT DEL to try and bring up task manager. Then I would press on the button all link that says to start a new process. Type in “explorer.exe” with no &#8220;&#8221;.</p>
<p>If explorer.exe is already running then end the process and start it again.</p>
<p>You can also try restarting your computer in safe mode, fully letting it load, and then shutting it down again.<br />

<p>Yes &#8220;new task&#8221; is the same. So you got to task manager, saw the new task button, clicked on it and typed in the new task (explorer.exe). Is this what you did?</p>

<p>I do CTRL+ALT+DELETE then first end process of explorer. Then in new task enter explorer.exe. The lap top begins to work. I still cannot see connected to wireless icon though mails download, I can log into QQ but when I click to open browser nothing happens till about 15 to 20 min later the connected to wireless icon appears and then the browser page appears. If I try to go to network connection to see if I am on wireless nothing happens till about 15 to 20 M later I get to see connected icon i.e. at same time the browser page appears.</p>

<p>Hi I have a HP Pavilion DV6700 and I was working on my laptop and the screen suddenly froze then I was not able to do anything even with the keyboard and such. I decided to turn the laptop off by holding the power button, it turned out this was not a good idea as I got a black screen with no cursor or anything but the fan and disc driver seem to be working fine. I then got annoyed so I started experimenting and found that if I hit ctrl alt del it would just restart the laptop and one time I started spammed enter as it got to the point that I really got angry I got the windows vista sound before you can log in. Then it seem that I was able to get in one of the accounts but it still have a black screen. Would really appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>If your computer is booting and you nearly got into Windows, this means that there is a problem with Windows. Have you tried pressing F8 when you start your laptop and going to a boot menu to choose safe mode? Also you can try putting your system disk in and doing a repair. This is not a full format because there is a repair option there.</p>

<p>An orange or yellow light can sometimes mean lack of power or a dead motherboard. These are the most common possibilities.</p>
<p>In this case the things to try are to try another power supply to run your computer. You can also view your motherboard and make sure there are no Bent pins or obstructions. This is not for the average PC user, and certain precautions need to be taken as you could ruin your computer&#8217;s components.<br />

<p>if you have had a virus you can try to start explorer.exe by going into task manager. Obviously the it is a damaged file or an unwanted registry entry.<br />
You can also hit cntr+alt+delete and then task manager.<br />
Run a new task called regedit<br />
Now in the left hand collum navigate to HKEY_local machine/software/microsoft/WindowsNT/Currentversion/winlogon.<br />
Click on the winlogon folder<br />
Now in the right hand panel click on shell.<br />
The data value should only be explorer.exe so delete anything after that,<br />
Do this by double clicking on shell and edit the value and hit ok<br />

<p>Hi there<br />
The virus would have not only damaged files but may not be removed entirely. Removing viruses is not easy as they are very sneaky. I would not feel safe until I had reformatted my computer after having a virus.</p>

<p>Hello Mitz. My Toshiba laptop is about five months old. I&#8217;ve run into a few problems with it before and solved them by pressing F8, entering safe mode, and setting a restore point on system restore. Last night, however, I left my computer running for about maybe an hour and a half and returned to it to find only the background&#8211;absent of the taskbar and the icons. I tried restarting the computer but ended up with a black screen. Task manager doesn&#8217;t work at this stage. I have even tried setting a restore point but nothing seems to be helping: the icons and taskbar appear only briefly and then I am left with just the background or a black screen again. Help? F8 isn&#8217;t getting me out of this one&#8230;</p>

<p>Did you try leaving it sit for an hour to cool off and then trying again?  Take out the battery and unplug it for 30 minutes, then try again.  Can you f8 into safe mode?  Download and run AVG free, spybot search and destroy, and malwarebytes anti-malware (one of them doesn&#8217;t run in safe mode I think &#8211; I haven&#8217;t had to clean a virus from safe mode in ages).<br />
Do you get an error message when you try to open task manager, or does it just do nothing?<br />
Check your RAM&#8230; if you have 2 sticks you might have to completely open the back of the laptop to get to the second stick&#8230;  if you are lucky enough to have 2 sticks try each one &#8211; one at a time in the first slot, because this sounds like a bad or corrupted hard drive, or a bad stick of ram &#8211; if it&#8217;s not a virus.</p>

<p>Hook up another monitor to it to see if it is actually working. There is a blue monitor plug at the back. If it works then you know something is wring with the screen..but if it doesn&#8217;t, something must be out of whack! Maybe you could make sure the memory and hard drive are in place. I do not recommend going into laptops further than this though.</p>

<p>look online for  directions to access your cpu&#8230; take that out and then put it back in.  While you have it open you might as well check the ram and video card and everything else you see.  Also just for the heck of it try pressing the fn key with the f1 through f12 keys (don&#8217;t know which one switches monitors)</p>

<p>Hello I have a question about this.  My computer is at the stage with the one flashing cursor and this happened right after I allowed an upgrade.  After I selected &#8220;RUN&#8221; for the upgrade my PC immediately switched to a blue screen saying that it would restart and that if I saw the blue screen again than that would be bad.  I saw this screen for maybe a split second if that, then my PC restarted automatically and then the flashing cursor with the black screen appeared.  Do you have a good idea what this means and how I am able to fix this?  Thank you</p>

Hi there<br />
It seems you have found your problem. Definitely backup your files first&#8230;Clean up your computer and maybe do some maintenance. Even a clean format will help. Then I would put things back one at a time. And in between restart the computer and make sure it is working&#8230;</p>
<p>Also when installing the printer, make sure the driver is for the Operating system you have&#8230;If the driver is for windows seven and you have XP then this is not good..</p>

<p>Hi I posted a few days ago and appreciated your feedback.  I have made a little progress but need some more guidance &#8230;</p>
<p>I uninstalled the printer software and reinstalled just the basic driver (making sure it was for my operating system).  I still have the same problem of booting to a black screen when the printer is connected via usb.  Unplug the printer and it boots fine, plug it in, boots to black screen.  When I press esc at boot up, it shows the printer on the list of bootable devices.  Lame.  A little research shows this is a problem with this particular printer, but hp has done nothing to solve or acknowledge the problem.</p>
<p>So now I want to disable the printer as a bootable device.  How?</p>

<p>Hi Mitz.  I looked at a lot of sites about this, yours is the best.  I got a black screen at boot, no beeps, no safe mode, would not boot from disc (5year old hp desktop with XP)</p>
<p>I unplugged all unnecessary peripherals, including the new hp printer I installed a couple days ago, and now it boots.</p>
<p>So where should I go from here?  I&#8217;m inclined to backup everything and then &#8230; reinstall windows (last did it 2.5 years ago)?  Call hp about why the new printer might cause a crash?  Also note that the computer has been running slower lately, not multitasking well, fan running often .. any suggestions appreciated!</p>

<p>I dont think tthat when my keyboard doesnt work has to do with my computer not work plus it stops working after the blinking underscore disppear and i was just pointing out that my keyboard didnt work. Lemme saythis again.<br />
My computer basically turns on shows a pic thts msi motherboard . Its just a picture i get at start up BEFORE anything. Then it usually goes to windows vista logo then account login. HOWEVER it just goes to a black screen with an underscore blinking. After a minute or so it goes to a blank black screen, no underscore and keyboard doesnt work, i hv left my computer on from this state to see if it just needs time. It never showed the windows vista logo or account login menu. I do not see a cursor orr anything.</p>

<p>Have you tried to get into safe mode as you said you see the MSI pic&#8230;? If you cannot, what about putting the OS cd in and trying a repair&#8230;Also have you unplugged everything that is not needed&#8230;devices and addons.</p>

<p>My computer is running on a vista. My computer turns on and shows this pic i always get, its msi motherboard thing then it goes to a black screen with a white blinking underscore. After a while it goes black totally, not turned off though and my keyboard doesnt work after it just goes black. No beeps. I think its the power or ram but idk what to do. I tried reseating my ram a lot of times and reseating videocard then everything else bu no hope. I used a air duster spray to blow away  the dust. I have a story just before my computer didnt work.

<p>Hello Walter,<br />
It sounds like you have a few problems there, but the first thing I would do is try and other monitor and maybe another keyboard. Or you could take your monitor and try it on someone else&#8217;s computer.<br />
I would also be looking for some kind of bent pin or hardware problem that is causing this.<br />

<p>hey thanks!! i solved my problem!!<br />
My problem was related to this one&#8230;..<br />
Leaving a bootable usb flash drive connected to your computer.<br />
Yes this can confuse your computer and it won’t know where to boot up. When your computer has a black screen from doing this and you realize this is the problem and remove the USB, the computer just continues to boot normally..<br />
&#8230;i accidentally left my ipod overnight and didnt eject it and then when i turned my computer on inb the morning..i saw my ipod charging..and then i immediately saw this article, then i just pulled my ipod wire chager then restart it then IT WORKS!!!!..thanks!!!1</p>

<p>IF your computer slowed down and was hard to use the Internet, then this could possibly mean that you have a virus. In this case you would need to work on the virus.<br />

<p>hey mitz&#8230;i am able to access the f2 menu.tried all auto repairs but they end in the same black screen.system restore says no restore point set: when i click &#8220;set restore point&#8221; tells me it&#8217;s operating in limited mode+cant undo a restore.no option to restore at that point bc it&#8217;s not clickable.<br />
did auto memory check+supervised it-never saw it find a problem but instead of final result i got the ole black screen.<br />
there&#8217;s a way to get into command prompt which opens as it should+allows me to type.can you tell me what to type?!</p>

<p>hi mitz&#8230; my husband&#8217;s hp laptop battery died some time ago+we share a power supply.unfortunately this has meant his shuts down improperly every time I need the cord,or he has to carry it away from outlet. not sure thats the cause,but now when booting it says can&#8217;t start windows normally+repair doesn&#8217;t work.I followed yr instructions to boot from cd+ it is allowing me to initiate new windows install&#8230;but im not sure that&#8217;s the right choice since a)doesn&#8217;t seem to be a boot pproblem and b)he hasn&#8217;t got enough memory+ i&#8217;m afraid of formatting partitions.we do have his data backed up to an external hard drive,but i&#8217;m scared I wouldn&#8217;t know what to look for to replace lost system files&#8230;+again not even 100% if im barking up the right tree to re-install windows. Do you think I should throw caution to the wind+format a partition?and if so-system or presario primary?&#8230;or should I try something else?

<p>Hi Amber<br />
It looks like some system files are damaged from not shutting it down nicely! Anyway when you put the disc in there is a repair option first on all Windows operating system cd&#8217;s. I would try that first. This way you will not have to install everything again. Which Windows do you have?</p>

<p>Hey Mitz, my old PSU still worked I just had forgotten to connect it to the motherboard, but my new one still doesn&#8217;t after about 3 minutes of usage, once I even managed to post on tom&#8217;s hardware, bu then the PSU gave out. I think maybe you are right about it not being able to handle the size, I am seriously considering just buying a new computer. Do you know how I could check if my PSU and graphics card are compatible with a new computer? last time, I did not get any specific ways other then &#8220;is or is not PCI express compatible&#8221; which it was, then did not work.</p>

Does your card meet what the games needs or is your power supply rated to handle the Vid card at max draw ? Is there a fan on your graphics card and is it working?</p>

<p>Hey Mitz,I  have a Compaq Presario CQ5210F, and just bought a new graphics card Geforce GTX460 and power supply Thermaltake T2 600W</p>
<p>I put both the graphics card and power supply into my computer, only to find that the grpahics card was not compatible even though it fit into my PCI-e slot. I removed it and tried again now the only change was the PSU. To my relief it started, but I did not have the monitor plugged in, so I could not see if the screen was working there was also a very high pitched squeal, that only happened this time i booted.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to plug everything back in and run the system repair function the computer gave me the option to run. In a little while when I came back, my screen was black. I attempted to turn it on again, but it would not work. I removed the PSU and tried the old one, but to my dismay, now the fans would not even work and the black screen is still present.</p>
<p>I am lost! Thanks, Diego</p>

<p>Hi Diego<br />
Was the cpu compatible with your motherboard. Could it handle the size? Also did you try the old power supply again or is that dead?</p>

<p>Hey there! Thanks for this great advice! My screen was completely black with no beeping sounds so it was pretty tough to figure out the problem. All I did, like you said, was take out the &#8220;I guess disk&#8221; in the back and wipe it with a clean cloth and WALA! Thanks again!</p>

<p>I have a HP a few years old laptop and I work with photoshop CS4 and do a lot of photo editing. I take all of my photos off and store them on an external hard drive. Recently while I am working on a photo my screen will go black but my computer stills appears to be running. I sometimes hold the button and restart the computer and everything will work fine. Sometimes I have to take the battery out and restart it that way for it to work. I don’t do anything but photoshop on this computer. Have you had any experience with anything like this? Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hi Mitz-<br />
No I cannot get into safe mode. The screen won&#8217;t come on at all. I think you are right on about the overheating does this mean it may have fried my laptop? Is there an external component that can be replaced that would help or fix it?! Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Adam<br />
That sounds like your NVidia driver has a problem &#8211; nvcpl is the NVidia control panel.<br />
If you can get to the boot menu and get into safe mode&#8230;this will load without drivers..maybe you could update or download the new driver.</p>

I have a Dell desk top when I turn it on there is nothing but a black screen and cursor and it had a popup saying something about antivirus 8 but now even that is gone. I dont even see my start button to do a system repair or get on any sites. What should I do?</p>

<p>Hello, I have a dell inspiron 1521. I was using it the other day and it was working fine. When my boyfriend was using it that night the screen just went blank on him. He turned it off and was able to get it back on, used it for a couple of minutes then the same thing happened. Since then everytime we try to turn it on the screen just stays blank ~ nothing. The power light will go on and you hear the fan also, but again nothing. I am not even able to open the disk to put anything in there. When I pust the button nothing happens?! Do you have any suggestions? Thank you very much</p>

<p>Hi Mitz, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Yes it was fine before the move, and initially worked when I moved it.</p>
<p>No it is the same monitor. There is no video card, it is onboard. (BD = Bluray Disc sorry).</p>
<p>I have two hard drives in it. I disconnected the slave drive and there is no hard drive noise whatsoever on boot up. Main hard drive failure?</p>

<p>Hmmm.. maybe you could try to access the hard drive by putting it in an external casing and getting the data off it? If you can&#8217;t access it then the hard drive is fried, but if you can, then the windows files might be corrupted.</p>

So the computer was fine until you moved it into another room..But it still worked in the new room and now has failed? Did you change monitors? I know you checked it, but is it the same one? Do you have a video card or onboard?<br />
What do you mean by BD?</p>

<p>Hi i built my own pc about 14 months ago using an old dell case and an A-Bit A-S78H motherboard. It has an AMD 780G chipset and earlier this year i upgraded to windows 7. Up to this point all was well</p>
<p>I moved the machine two days ago from one room to another. Last night whilst ripping a BD i left the room and came back to check progress only to find that the screen was showing the very first boot display but was frozen. I turned off and it took a few attempts but it did come back on.</p>
<p>It ripped the BD sucessfully and i tried another BD only for same thing to happen. It was late so turned off and tried again tonight but nothing.</p>
<p>On turning on the fan cranks up, there is a bit of noise from hard drive but not much. No beeps and the screen is blank. The monitor actaully stays on stand by. Ive reseated ram, removed ram sticks one at a time, checked sata cables but nothing. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hey, i have slight problem. I recently was working on my computer, and took the cpu out. when i started to put it in, i noticed the pins were bent, so i straightened them out and the cpu went in perfectly. I plugged everything in as they should go, and took my computer back to my room and plugged it in. the computer turned on, all the fans were spinning, and the lights were on, but my computer screen never turned on, even after i connected a vga and dvi to it. the graphics is integrated. what could be the problem? cpu? graphics?</p>

<p>I would say the cpu. Have another look at it&#8230;But the pins can only be bent so many times, maybe one is damaged now even though it is straight.</p>

<p>I have a Compaq laptop that won&#8217;t get past a black screen.  was on laptop using battery power and it just shut off (battery needs replaced &#8211; hubby wasn&#8217;t aware) and then put in power cord, it started a recovery process and hasn&#8217;t gotten past the black screen since.  I took it to Fshop they said needs whole install and if I want data will be about $200.  Is there any way I can get the data off myself?  Laptop is 2yrs old and ready for a new one but I need the data.  I managed to get laptop to a dos prompt and attempted to copy files to a usb key &#8211; unsuccessful.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>hello mitz, i have a problem.</p>
<p>i have an acer desktop computer, with a samsung lcd monitor, and an NVIDIA 9600 GT graphics card. the computer has been working fine, but i have had on occasions a blue error screen showing:</p>
<p>HIGH_OR_LOW</p>
<p>the computer has had a long ourney in the car from london to yorkshire, and i have brought it into my room. the computer kept on restarting and the ACER screen would flash up, but i could not get the bios.</p>
<p>i tryed hard reset, unplugging everything and putting my finger on the power button for a minute, but after this i now have no light on my power button. my screen will not connect, but goes black if it does, and the fans are running but i have no boot up sequence taking place.</p>
<p>one last thing: i have 2 lights on the top of my ACER ASPIRE, one red, possibly for memory, and the other green, for power. the green light is not coming on and the red light is flashing when i start up, which is from the main power switch because my power button refuses to work!</p>
<p>thanks for your help, much appreciated, dan</p>
<p>PS: i have also tryed reseating the cpu, but nothing has happened. i think the hard reset caused the removal of the restart.</p>

<p>HIGH_OR_LOW??? I think this has something to do with voltage but it could apply to anything. At first when the computer was getting to the splash screen and then restarting I would have said to check the ram. Remove one piece or try to make sure it is in properly. And next probably a repair disc as it seems that it was trying to load&#8230; Now that is has a black screen it sounds like something else is going on&#8230;at this stage I would hope its something to do with the power supply not putting out enough power. </p>
<p>How long have you been getting the blue screen, before transporting the computer?</p>

<p>Computer is 6 months old (Gateway) This passed week it just randomly shuts itself off. When I try to reboot it takes 3-10 tries to get it to boot up, otherwise it sits at a black screen and does nothing at all. The fans are running the lights are on but the screen is black. I checked most of your suggestions except for the acquiring of a new video card. I am 99% sure its the video card, I am just wondering why it would do this being only 6 months old. Why is it preventing the computer from going through the boot up process?</p>

<p>Hi, I was just on my laptop (ASUS with Vista) and on Facebook and ordering from an internet site when the anti virus (Comodo) came up with a buffer under run attack and also virus warnings of intercepted .exe files.  I blocked these and then the screen went black with a cursor in the top left corner.  Do you have any suggestions as to what has happened or how to fix this problem please?</p>

<p>Hi Claire<br />
Have you restarted your computer? Is that when it is a black screen with a cursor? I would put your operating system cd in and do a repair. You can see the details above..Which Operating system do you have?</p>

<p>The first question is &#8230;Is it compatible? The next one is, do you have to enable something in the bios&#8230;like auto detect before changing it.. Can you test it in another computer?<br />
Also make sure it is in the right way&#8230;Something may have changed. Check the pins. If all else fails I would take it back..Maybe the place you bought it from can test it&#8230;?</p>

<p>Hey mate I&#8217;m dealing with a problem even mine bro geek can&#8217;t seem to fix it and perhaps you might know what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Currently I got a NVIDIA Geforce G100 in the pc.<br />
I want to install NVIDIA Geforce GT240 but when it&#8217;s inserted I get a black screen after the blue screen.<br />
Also with 1 dash on the screen. But mine pc doesn&#8217;t do anything anymore. Beside keyboard quickly disconnect as well.</p>

<p>I am not sure what you want to do&#8230;here are two options</p>
<p>1.  ok&#8230;Remove the video card and go back to what you had.Plug your monitor in the correct plug. ..then you could try this when starting your computer..<br />
Hold F8 key while booting ur PC and select &#8221; Enable VGA Mode&#8221; or &#8220;Enable lower resolution&#8221; not sure which one you have. </p>
<p>2. Another thing you could try is going into safe mode and removing the drivers from the device manager.</p>
<p>3. If your computer is working correctly try going into safe made and removing the drivers of the old video card first&#8230;Sound like there is a clash.. Then shut down, install the new video card, and start&#8230;</p>

<p>Hi<br />
My dell laptop running Vista will not boot up. Yesterday it said that it needed to run repairs, this happened for some time with a couple of restarts. After leaving it for several hours it was showing a black screen with only the cursor visible. Today it starts and runs the warning that it did not shut down properly (I suppose from me shutting down with the power button). Every option offered ends up with a black screen with the cursor visible. From here all I can do is turn off from the power button. Any suggestions? I have all the original cd&#8217;s that came with the computer.<br />
Thanks for any help that may be forthcoming.</p>

<p>I recently updated my PC (Windows Update) and rebooted. PC froze after successful reboot and now I get a black screen with a cursor. I can not boot into safe mode either by pressing the F8 key. Nor can I hit the F12 key because no matter what I do it takes me to &#8220;Press F1 top continue (leads to black screen/cursor) and Press F2 enter SETUP&#8221; which has options that I don&#8217;t understand.<br />

<p>When you start the computer does it still show the boot options and have you tried to boot into safe mode. If you can get into there fully, and then restart the computer it may fix it sometimes. If you cannot get in anywhere I would put the Windows cd into the cd drive and get it to boot to the cd&#8230;Instead of formatting choose the repair option.

<p>Hi need help<br />
So your computer is running well without the extra ram that is causing a problem. Have you tried putting the good piece of ram in the other slot&#8230;maybe the slot is faulty&#8230;Just remember each time you touch the ram you are risking damage to it if not done carefully. Also if you could get another stick of ram to test that might help&#8230;.If you are happy with how the computer is running without that stick of ram I would leave it alone.</p>

<p>Hi for the last couple of days ive been having trouble with my computer.<br />
It started when i went down stairs to eat dinner, i had left some programs running i came back and the computer had a black screen which said &#8216; boot failed! &#8216;. I was able to restart it press F8 and boot in advanced option menu. I scanned my computer and found a trojan (avp32.exe). I turned my computer off later that night, came back from school and i couldn&#8217;t boot up, not even by pressing F8.<br />
Many thanks if you could help.</p>

<p>Hi Xave<br />
How did you get rid of the trojan?<br />
What virus program are you running?<br />
It must have damaged the boot sector on your hard drive.There is an article on this website called &#8220;how to repair your damaged boot sector&#8230;I think&#8230;just search for it&#8230;I did it a long time ago but can still apply in this case&#8230;That might get you in..but you need to get rid of the trojan&#8230;</p>
<p>Can you take the hard drive out and format it in an external hard drive&#8230;you will lose your files though&#8230;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just lost my nvidia 5200 video card.  I shut it down and next day it would boot up but the display would not come on just a orange light on it.  I had it checked out and it was the video card.  The place the did the work for me gave me a video card the other day and i installed it last night.  When i plugged in the monitor into the video card i got nothing on the monitor.  All i got was the card and my computer did find it and told me it was a ATI Radon 7000 series.  I went to the website and downloaded the drivers for it but i still get nothing.  I am using my on board  video to get my monitor to work.  Now my 5200 was a avg card and this is a pci. I am lost on what i can do now.</p>

<p>Hi there Randy<br />
I have a few ideas and maybe questions:<br />
**Have you checked into the bios to see if you need to enable the use of this card?<br />
**Can you install the drivers and the card while using the onboard video. Then restart and plug into the video card?<br />
**Is the onboard disabled when you are trying to use the new video card..? So when you have the black screen if you moved the plugs into the onboard would the screen show up?<br />
**Can you try your new video card in s different pci slot?<br />
**You old card was AGP and this is PCI..not sure if it makes a difference. The computer still should find it.</p>

<p>Mitz,<br />
I&#8217;m a tech myself with a little less than a year exp. I use google a lot and read forums for help then whack myself in the head because i usually know how to solve the problem in the first place. However; I recently gutted my desktop and bought all new hardware for it, and built it up to start a gaming PC. Everything was going fine. About a few months later whenever I would try to simply hit the power button to start the machine all the LED lights would go on as usual but I would just get a black screen, but I could simply shut the power supply off and on again, and after the 3rd or 4th time it would start. I have never learned anything about troubleshooting a black screen with no code or beeps from the motherboard. I was furious when it finally wouldn&#8217;t start anymore no matter how many times I tried. I came across your article after wording my problem differently a bunch of times in google, and could not be happier. Matter of fact I have never posted anything ever in a forum because it&#8217;s mostly a waste of time. You my friend have made me a happy man and for that I thank you, as I now have a place to start troubleshooting my black screen. But there is a huge possibility that I may have damaged my motherboard or CPU permanently because of starting it and shutting it down so many times. Also if you have any advice for me I would appreciate it. </p>
<p>Huge fan,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Hi Jim nice to have you here&#8230;<br />
I have had a similar problem. I used to have a computer that sometimes started and sometime did not (seemed to start). I seemed to just think it was the started button as I was kind of not pressing it in properly. If I made sure I pressed the button straight in and not on an angle I could guarantee it would start ok. I know this sounds just too simple to be true but I swear that was it.<br />
Anyway since your computer is not starting at all now and I guess you would have tried most things..I would take the hard drive out&#8230;replace it&#8230;format&#8230;if you can&#8230;and see if the problem remains. If you get a working computer but the starting problem is still there, then you have a chance to troubleshoot the problem&#8230;<br />
Computers can do weird things&#8230;and get black screens for any reason at all&#8230;You should have seen me when I was troubleshooting a black screen and found out after hours of work that it was the keyboard plug with a bent pin. I just presumed the computer would start up and tell me there was no keyboard present&#8230;which it is meant to do&#8230;but no&#8230;that would be too easy and obvious.</p>

<p>Hi selina<br />
I think the first black screen was the warning that there was something wrong. You could try some of the steps mentioned above or take the computer to a pro. </p>
<p>Note for everyone: Just remember the safety aspects of opening a computer case. I would rather people experiment and an old cheap computer than their $2,000 baby..(that&#8217;s a computer) Just a quick warning. If you are willing to risk mistakes and not blame yourself then I say go for it&#8230;How are you going to learn when you are not game to do anything? If you do not want to know anything about computers and have enough money, take it to a pro&#8230;</p>

<p>Hello, I just recently got the black screen, approx 2days from now. I can&#8217;t seem to figure out the problem, I remember my Norton Anti Virus said there was issues that got resolved as far as malware/virus go. And anyways when I startup everything is normal I see a black screen and little white horizontal lines flicker a bit, but the my cursor is available and I open up Task Manager and I am able to open up Internet, so I am typing this message right now on my Black Screen of Death computer. Please let me know what further actions I can take to help solve this, I really don&#8217;t want to resort to restoring my computer.</p>

<p>Hi there Thaddeus<br />
I would try this:<br />
You can use your Windows discs to possibly fix this.<br />
Put your windows XP CD into the cd rom drive.<br />
Go to the atart menu. Choose run.<br />
Type in sfc /scannow</p>
<p>Thats if you have xp&#8230;it will scan for errors and restore the right files&#8230; Also you could try installing a new driver for your display options&#8230;<br />
and&#8230;.I do not think a system restore will help but a full format will..</p>

<p>After transporting my PC from one place to another, my PC works well for the first few days. Until one day, my PC suddenly black out and I heard noises coming out from my PC. The sound is kinda like when a DVD is inserted into the DVD ROM, buzzing sound. Then I press the power button but my PC won&#8217;t start anymore. No boot screen, no beep sound and blank screen. I tried to change my RAM with another working RAM but the problems still exist. Then I realize the hard disk is broken because when I plug the hard disk into USB to SATA/IDE cable, I heard some clicking noise coming out from the harddisk. So I plug in a working hard disk into my PC but it stills come out with blank screen. No bios, no beep sound. Please help as I am now stuck with a broken PC. Thanks.</p>
<p>Its an old PC with 1GB RAM, 40HDD, build-in graphic card and MSI motherboard (I forgot the model and the PC is not with me right now.)</p>

<p>Hi! I was just playing an RPG game (Maplestory) in my Dell laptop when all of a sudden various red vertical stripes appeared and froze my screen. I couldn&#8217;t do anything but to shut it down manually (holding down the power button). After turning it on again, I could barely see the Windows logo as it loaded, then nothing but a black screen. Every time I turn it on again I just see a black screen. I left the sound on and as it seems, the laptop works because I typed in my password and I heard that Windows account initiating sound and could restart it by using the keyboard. What do you think the problem is?<br />
Thanks in advantage for your help!</p>

I would remove one stick and see how it goes&#8230;be careful because of static electricity and all that&#8230;.See the links above for doing this safely&#8230;It will boot up slower with one stick but check it out&#8230;It may not boot at all&#8230;If not swap the ram and try the other.</p>

<p>Hello Mitz,</p>
<p>Thanks for looking into my problem and your response.</p>
<p>My computer seems OK now &#8211; strange I know.  It seemed to fix itself, albeit with a little help from me too.  Just to answer your question, there wasn&#8217;t a cursor flashing when I had the problem and it wasn&#8217;t set to boot from cd-rom first.  I tried a boot up cd but nothing happened.</p>
<p>What I decided to do is get inside the unit, remove all components and reinstall them.  It didn&#8217;t work first time but after a little waiting it came to life.  The only problem I have now is that it seems unstable &#8211; as in everytime I boot up I get a feeling that it won&#8217;t work &#8211; that actually happened again for a bit yesterday!</p>

It sounds though you are in your computer but there might be a hardware problem&#8230;If you look in the article above&#8230;I would start with the ram being faulty..only because you have replaced all the components and now it works for a minute&#8230;</p>

<p>hello mitz</p>
<p>yes at first i thought the monitor broken, swaped it with another one and same issue was occuring, then i thought video card, but the red light wouldnt stop and the pc didnt beeped when i restarted, which lead me to either processor or ram or some chipset on the motherboard. this evening i replaced every component with some from another pc of mine, except video card and ofc motherboard; i tried to boot it up without the video card installed, thus no monitor either, just to see if it beeps or the red light (from processor) stops, and it didnt so i suppose&#8230;.its from the shitty motherboard i have : /</p>

<p>I started to get the black screen after getting my power unit replaced. Did&#8217;nt have a problem before then. I can get it to boot up now about 10% of the time by removing and then resetting the memory cards. When winxp is up and running applications tend to run slowly though. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run my a/v and have cleaned up the registry but it did not help.</p>

<p>Heya, i got something pretty interesting for you peeps. So here&#8217;s the deal: i was doing some lousy programming in Pascal (i know, great coding aint it? *rolling eyes*) and i would have some black screens every now and then but not completely black, just from the program, he was inverting colors or something, anyway yesterday they got inverted again, then my pc froze. Restarted (actually i had to unplug the power since restart didnt work) =&gt; monitor didnt get any signal and the pc wouldnt boot or something like that. Also the DVD-ROM couldnt be opened and the &#8220;thinking&#8221; red light that indicates the processor is doing stuff was constantly on. I cant recall if i heard any beeps either. Ofc i tried to swap monitors, wasnt from that.</p>
<p>So&#8230;.any clues whats wrong? <img src='http://tips4pc.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>hi Rahamatata<br />
My first thought is display, video card, or monitor. Have you tested any of these? Also how long was the light red for&#8230;.did it stop. Was the computer loaded at the time or was it just a red light to the cd drive.</p>

<p>Apologies for this late response. Blame limited computer access and the like. As for the question you posed, the answer is no. There was no burning smell when this occurred, although the laptop did seem to overheat for a bit. No smell, though.</p>

<p>Hi katiee<br />
What virus checker are you using?<br />
Do you have an operating system disc. I would try that first. Instructions are above. After that (if that&#8217;s not working) I would take it to a pro. If you are willing to play with yourself though&#8230;I would remove the hard drive and put it in an external case and check if it is still ok?</p>

You can use your Windows discs to possibly fix this.<br />
Put your windows XP CD into the cd rom drive.<br />
Go to the atart menu. Choose run.<br />
Type in  sfc /scannow</p>
<p>This will scan your system files,find anything out of place, and replace them with known good ones from the CD. After you are done, restart your computer and see how you go. This is just one thing to try for that problem. The other is to go into the recovery console when you insert your discs. Let me know if you want to know about that.</p>

<p>My laptop received the dreaded black screen today. I was simply searching the web when this singular noise rang out, kind of like a whirring down, and then the screen went black. The fan is running, although I can barely hear it. There is no cursor and the power switch light no longer turns blue, but orange. I haven&#8217;t the slightest clue how to pinpoint the cause of this problem since my laptop has been experiencing some other issues as well. For example, those lines that you mentioned that appear and are normally the result of a failing display adapter or video card had been plaguing my laptop for awhile, almost to the point of frustration. However, that problem seemed to go away on its own. Yesterday, I installed updates that had been sitting in my computer for a bit. There were 18 of them. I&#8217;m what one would call technologically inept, so this is a problem that I sincerely cannot solve on my own. I apologize for the lack of detail and the brevity of this post, but I can&#8217;t really go much in depth considering that I am typing from a phone. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>hey maybe you deleted something you should not have. Can you start in safe mode&#8230;or even boot from a cd&#8230;You can repair you Windows files by putting the Original windows cd in and choosing repair&#8230;</p>

<p>My computer was installing 14 windows update it had downloaded automatically while I was using it normally.  However, after installing the 5th update there was a power failure.  Now all I get is a black screen, no cursor or beeps, when I turn on the pc.  Restarting doesn&#8217;t do anything and I can&#8217;t access the BIOS screen.  I&#8217;m running Windows XP Service Pack 3.  What can I do to rectify this?</p>

<p>Hi Sij<br />
I missed your question:</p>
<blockquote><p>My computer was installing 14 windows update it had downloaded automatically while I was using it normally. However, after installing the 5th update there was a power failure. Now all I get is a black screen, no cursor or beeps, when I turn on the pc. Restarting doesn’t do anything and I can’t access the BIOS screen. I’m running Windows XP Service Pack 3. What can I do to rectify this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch that sucks&#8230;Quick question??? Is there a flashing cursor on your screen? You can try putting the operating cd in the drive and maybe doing a repair by starting from the cd.. If you can&#8217;t get into bios, hopefully it is set to start from a cd.</p>

<p>Got a black screen.  Tried Chkdsk /f.  No bad files, so that is good news.  A few days ago I started hearing noise I thought the harddrive was crashing.  It runs on safe mode, check out with Malwarebyte, so now I am lost&#8230;</p>

<p>I received a computer today with this problem. I can get into the bios, but when the computer attempts to boot from the Hard Drive or the DVD-Rom, it just stops. The screen is completely blank when booting from HD and shows &#8220;Boot from CD:&#8221; when attempting to boot from DVD-ROM. Nothing else happens.</p>
<p>I removed the battery on the motherboard to do a reset, but that did not help. It did show an error that the computer failed from an overheating issue and that the cpu fan malfunctioned (Even though I see it spinning when I turn on the computer). </p>
<p>Right now, it seems to be the processor. I&#8217;m going to see if I can find a replacement to see if that works. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>The first thing I would suggest is to press F8 when restarting and choose &#8220;last known good configuration&#8221; from the menu. You have to be lucky to get this to work but why not give it a try. Also are you saying that you cannot boot from a cd?<br />
What about the hard drive? Did you disconnect this&#8230;And you can make sure there is no cd in the dvd drive. Without a hard drive it &#8220;should&#8221; say the there is no hard disk drive found ..or something like this.</p>

<p>These are basic things I would try first:<br />
***Turn the power off and check all cables are plugged in correctly.<br />
***Is the monitor plugged into the right plug on the back of the computer. Sometimes there are two choices which means it has an add on video card. Therefore you need to plug it in the bottom one.<br />
***Try another monitor to see if that works.</p>
<p>Let me know what happens..</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but is this reply directed to me though or Mustafa? Well, I think we have the same issue anyway. It&#8217;s not that it will crash, thing is, it happens occasionally. Like you don&#8217;t know when will you encounter this problem. I find it funny coz whenever I will power on my computer I would always say, &#8220;please, boot up, please boot up..&#8221; lol! then there&#8217;s also this funny thing, like, when I need to re-start my pc because I just installed somethin, it will just shut down but it will not restart, monitor will just stay black and light glows with my cpu running but it doesn&#8217;t restart whatsoever.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been having this problem for 3mos now and this is the exact issue that I have, &#8220;When your computer gets a black screen only sometimes, it usually means your ram is on the way out..For example if you boot your computer and it doesn’t work, then go back an hour later, and it does work&#8221; &#8212; The first time I reseated my ram, it did some magic coz my problem with booting up did not occur again for 2 weeks I think so I thought my problem was resolved. Then it happened again after a few weeks, the same thing. Computer will not boot up with cpu and monitor on. Then will go back after a few hours and it does work. I tried doing the eraser magic and same thing works after a few weeks then will encounter the same problem again and this is happening for 3mos now. I tried removing both of my memory modules but no beeps coming from my mobo whatsoever. Tried removing some hardware still the same thing. So what I do is i just go back after an hour or two and try starting it up again. So, what do you think? Is it my mobo or memory?</p>

<p>Have you checked to see if it is not overheating. It seems to be working, and then after a time it crashes, and then later it comes back again&#8230;Your memory usually gives you a warning and then just goes. Do you think the computer needs to cool down before using again?</p>

<p>Ok,</p>
<p>When i connect socket to power supply, the power-on switch on the motherboard turns on indicating sleep-mode(steady red glow)</p>
<p>After which I turn my screen on, then main power on &#8211;<br />
all fans rev up, including the graphics cards, and i can hear the HDD and CD drive rev up too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile nothings happened on screen, doesnt react to the pc turning on, just powerless black screen. &#8216;no signal detected&#8217;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure my graphics card, cpu n motherboard are fine because their fans/lights are active, but I cant tell for sure about the RAM. I think theyre fine because when i remove them before start up its the same reaction.</p>
<p>i have a feeling its either the graphics card (since its a video response issue) or maybe keyboard?</p>

<p>My daughters computer has just black screened. It is an AsRock MB, Amibios on XP. When I power up the fans start, the cd and floppy flash, the HD whirrs but there is no beep, no curser, nothing. The CPU fan starts and all these continue to run. There is a click and faint noises from the HD as if it is trying to work. I have had video cards fail before but they started to fail by collapsing mid session and them going black. Any sugestions?</p>

<p>IF it sounds like everything is going&#8230;like enough power going through, then I would start with the simple checks&#8230;Removing or unplugging and extras is a good start&#8230;Then I would check the ram next as it is the most common cause&#8230;Just remember that if you just open a computer and touch stuff you transfer static electricity to the components and kill them&#8230; If you do not have an antistatic strap, make sure you take other precautions when opening the computer&#8230;<br />
<strong><br />
Backyard techie rules</strong><br />
Make sure all power cords are disconnected from the computer.<br />
Where bare feet. I know that sounds funny&#8230;.<br />
Stand on a lino or tile floor..not carpet..<br />
Have dry clean hands..<br />
Touch the metal casing inside the computer to release static electricity.<br />
Now carefully touch the parts.<br />
<strong><br />
Please note:</strong> It is still a risk to do any electrical work yourself so proceed at your own risk. If your computer is insured then do not open it yourself as it will void your policy.</p>

<p>If you can start in safe mode or even get into your computer I would do a system restore or remove what you installed. If it is a device driver go to the control panel&gt;system icon&gt;go to device manager or something that says devices&#8230;not sure what version you have&#8230;.maybe if you have xp there is a hardware tab. </p>
<p>Remove what you installed if you can&#8230;</p>

<p>I have a Dell desktop computer &amp; It is about 3 or 4 years old. I&#8217;m using Windows XP. Just earlier today, I was doing what I usually did &amp; that was just surfing around on the internet..a blue screen popped up out of no where &amp; it mentioned not having a software or hardware fully installed.  It has popped up with the same error about 3 times but everytime I shut down the pc &amp; start it back up, It works fine. This time I tried to do the same thing &amp; the dell thing loaded up but after that..the screen went black. I tried starting it up another 3 times because I was confused &amp; kept getting the black screen.</p>
<p>I must add that there was no sounds. I am not good at repairing computer&#8217;s so could someone please help me out?</p>

<p>Hi Candice&#8230;<br />
Ouch&#8230;A Blue screen of death (BSOD) is a warning that something is failing and it will usually tells you what is wrong by providing a stop code and error name in capital letters. Did you write anything down when you saw the blue screen, because now you have a black screen and the computer is not going to tell you anything now&#8230;</p>
<p>This is where the above article comes in&#8230;when you have a black screen and no idea what is wrong.</p>

<p>Help! I have a Dell laptop, 18months old, Vista.<br />
I have been editing photos with adobe lightroom for the last week or so, and I have ALL of my babies pictures as well as customers that I take pictures for on my editing software on this laptop&#8230;.recently installed the lightroom program, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve done different, other than having alot of pictures on the memory. Booted it up this morning and it almost immediately went black, a few times it would try and boot up for a second or two and I&#8217;d see the Dell symbol, and then black again. Can hear fan for a minute like it trying to work, but that&#8217;s it. No beeping, and no other symptoms that I can remember. Can anyone offer advice as to my next course of action? I&#8217;m not at all savy in computer hardware or repair, so I don&#8217;t have any clue&#8230;please help!</p>

<p>I have the following problem.<br />
My computer has Windows Vista Ultimate on it and yesterday I attempted to reinstall Vista Ultimate from the Original disc that I have.<br />
The install sequence started ok and I entered the product key and the install started, the computer rebooted itself as it does periodically during the install, then all I had for the following 6 hours was a black screen with no indication as to what was happening. Then to add to my problems we had a power cut. Even though I have a battery backup that safely shuts down the computer it just ran flat with no indication of the computer being closed down.<br />
Now, At boot up, it sound like it is booting as the cpu fan is running and the lights are on. It also finds the cd rom but it won’t boot from the Windows Vista Ultimate cd either.<br />
It will only boot to a black screen and the power switch light will be on. Everything appears to be running but I can’t see anything on the screen, not even a flashing cursor.<br />
I am also unable to get into the BIOS. I have no idea what is the problem here. The computer worked normally before the reinstall commenced.</p>

<p>It sounds like something has happened when it was interrupted. It is very hard to play around with a laptop..not as easy to remove parts or fix them. What about plugging a monitor into the spare monitor port on the back&#8230;That will check the display&#8230;.Then make a copy of your cd or dvd and try using the copy to see if it will boot from there&#8230;. does it come up with &#8220;press any key to boot from cd&#8221;?</p>

<p>At this point I would start with the mother board and the cpu if they work together and then keep replacing parts until it doesn&#8217;t work&#8230;&#8230;to find the problem. You are lucky you can try another motherboard, most people are left at that dead end because they do not have anything to replace it with.</p>
<p>This reminds of the good old days, repairing computers but the only difference is that I had a pile of 20 in front of me. I always used to put the black screen jobs until the end as they always took the longest&#8230; The funny thing is I never did it the easy way because I wanted to know every problem and every solution. I still don&#8217;t know all the answers to this &#8220;black screen&#8221; thing. </p>
<p>The other day I had two black screens on my computer&#8230;the one I use&#8230;one was my nvidia driver getting updated through Windows updates and the other was a virus program, security issue. I think it is haunting me&#8230;.Of course these black screens are easy to deal with because I had an error message telling me what it was&#8230;.Why can&#8217;t a computer tell you that the &#8220;hard drive is defective&#8221; or that the &#8220;video card has died&#8221;???? without having to add a computer diagnostic device. </p>

<p>jessa, what video chipset does your computer have?  My computer had the nVidia chipset, which was defective. (You can google &#8220;Nvidia defect&#8221; and find tons of information surrounding the defect, the companys that were affected, ie, Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc., class action suits, the settlements, and various other information).  I had numerous symptoms including, black screen, blue screen with lines, not waking from sleep mode, etc. My computer was purchased in May 2007, but I was able to file a small claim in my city just last month (June 2010) and received a settlement from HP.  You&#8217;re welcome to email me if you have further questions.  Actually, anyone reading this who wants more info is also welcome to email me at <a href="mailto:zeebiz@verizon.net">zeebiz@verizon.net</a>.  I don&#8217;t want to bad-mouth any product or company, but I&#8217;m for the little guy!  We spend money and expect good quality products, but when those products fail and the company(ies) responsible try to downplay it or sweep it under the rug, I want fair justice.</p>

<p>Its great that we can sometimes fix the problem when your computer has a black screen.. Some people are lucky as the black screen problem appears to magically go away and stay way&#8230;Other times the black screen is just a warning that something is starting to go wrong and packup. Hope this post can help. I have added to this article as the problems cropped up&#8230; It amazes me how many solutions and causes there are for the one symptom.</p>

<p>This got my &#8220;major&#8221; failure fixed as soon as I read about the RAM. I had already tried booting from disks and trying to get in through DOS and keyboard button combos and nothing would solve it.</p>
<p>-Then I was reminded of my recent RAM install that worked well for months may possibly have an issue, and Bada-bing! solved. Thanks!</p>

<p>I just had this issue and the problem, I believe, was related to an expired McAfee.  I had tried restoring from a previous good boot but it didn&#8217;t work.  After hours of restarting the computer and trying various tricks, I finally shut the computer off as it was loading drivers.  The next time I started the computer it realized something was wrong and tried to recover.  I was able to get to a command prompt and execute explorer.exe.  When the computer restarted I was able to get to windows.  At that time I noticed that my free McAfee from Comcast had expired (because Comcast went to Norton).  I downloaded the free Norton, which uninstalled McAfee, restarted the computer and everything has been fine.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for your advice.  My Problem: Twice in two days my PC (Windows XP)displayed a black screen.  Nothing else.  Onstart there was one beep.  The reset button did not restart my PC, the shut down button did not shut down PC.  I had to turn off the power, wait some seconds there turn power back on.  This time when I turned on my PC it booted up just fine.<br />
Thanks.<br />
