<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
Uh-oh..... <br />
Shit!! <br />
What the hell!? <br />
Go get your backup tape. (You do have a backup tape?) <br />
That's SOOOOO bizarre. <br />
Wow!! Look at this..... <br />
Hey!! The suns don't do this. <br />
Terminated??! <br />
What software license? <br />
Well, it's doing something..... <br />
Wow....that seemed fast..... <br />
I got a better job at Lockheed... <br />
Management says... <br />
Sorry, the new equipment didn't get budgetted. <br />
What do you mean that wasn't a copy? <br />
It didn't do that a minute ago... <br />
Where's the GUI on this thing? <br />
Damn, and I just bought that pop... <br />
Where's the DIR command? <br />
The drive ate the tape but that's OK, I brought my screwdriver. <br />
I cleaned up the root partition and now there's lots of free space. <br />
What's this "any" key I'm supposed to press? <br />
Do you smell something? <br />
What's that grinding sound? <br />
I have never seen it do *that* before... <br />
I think it should not be doing that... <br />
I remember the last time I saw it do that... <br />
You might as well all go home early today ... <br />
My leave starts tomorrow. <br />
Ooops. <br />
Hmm, maybe if I do this... <br />
"Why is my "rm *.o" taking so long?" <br />
Hmmm, curious... <br />
Well, my files were backed up. <br />
What do you mean you needed that directory? <br />
What do you mean /home was on that disk? I umounted it! <br />
Do you really need your home directory to do any work? <br />
Oracle will be down until 8pm, but you can come back in and finish your work when it comes up tonight. <br />
I didn't think anybody would be doing any work at 2am, so I killed your job. <br />
Yes, I chowned all the files to belong to pvcs. Is that a problem to you? <br />
We're standardizing on AIX. <br />
Wonder what this command does? <br />
What did you say your (l)user name was...? ;-) <br />
You did what to the floppy??? <br />
Sorry, we deleted that package last week... <br />
NO! Not that button! <br />
Uh huh......"nu -k $USER".. no problem....sure thing... <br />
Sorry, we deleted that package last week... <br />
[looks at workstation] "Say, what version of DOS is this running?" <br />
Oops! (said in a quiet, almost surprised voice) <br />
YEEEHA!!! What a CRASH!!! <br />
What do you mean that could take down the whole network? <br />
What's this switch for anyways...? <br />
Tell me again what that '-r' option to rm does <br />
Say, What does "Superblock Error" mean, anyhow? <br />
If I knew it wasn't going to work, I would have tested it sooner. <br />
Was that your directory? <br />
System coming down in 0 min.... <br />
The backup procedure works fine, but the restore is tricky! <br />
Hey Fred, did you save that posting about restoring filesystems with vi and a toothpick? More importantly, did you print it out? <br />
OH, SH*T! (as they scrabble at the keyboard for ^c). <br />
The sprinkler system isn't supposed to leak is it? <br />
It is only a minor upgrade, the system should be back up in a few hours. (This is said on a monday afternoon.) <br />
I think we can plug just one more thing in to this outlet strip with out triping the breaker. <br />
What is all this I here about static charges destroying computers? <br />
I found this rabbit program that is supposed to test system performance and I have it running now. <br />
Ummm... Didn't you say you turned it off? <br />
The network's down, but we're working on it. Come back after diner. (Usually said at 2200 the night before thesis deadline...) <br />
Ooops. Save your work, everyone. FAST! <br />
Boy, it's a lot easier when you know what you're doing. <br />
I hate it when that happens. <br />
And what does it mean 'rm: .o: No such file or directory'? <br />
Why did it say '/bin/rm: not found'? <br />
Nobody was using that file /vmunix, were they? <br />
You can do this patch with the system up... <br />
What happens to a Hard Disk when you drop it? <br />
The only copy of Norton Utilities was on THAT disk??? <br />
Well, I've got a backup, but the only copy of the restore program was on THAT disk.... <br />
What do mean by "fired"? <br />
hey, what does mkfs do? <br />
where did you say those backup tapes were kept? <br />
...and if we just swap these two disc controllers like this... <br />
don't do that, it'll crash the sys........ SHIT <br />
what's this hash prompt on my terminal mean? <br />
dd if=/dev/null of=/vmunix <br />
find /usr2 -name nethack -exec rm -f {}; <br />
now it's funny you should ask that, because I don't know either <br />
Any more trouble from you and your account gets moved to the 750 <br />
Ooohh, lovely, it runs SVR4 <br />
SMIT makes it all so much easier...... <br />
Can you get VMS for this Sparc thingy? <br />
I don't care what he says, I'm not having it on my network <br />
We don't support that. We won't support that. <br />
...and after I patched the microcode... <br />
You've got TECO. What more do you want? <br />
We prefer not to change the root password, it's an nice easy one <br />
Just add yourself to the password file and make a directory... <br />

The 10 Types of Users<br />
<br />
<br />
El Explicito -  "I tried the thing, ya know, and it worked, ya know, but <br />
		now it doesn't, ya know?"<br />
Advantages:     Provides interesting communication challanges.<br />
Disadvantages:  So do chimps.<br />
Symptoms:       Complete inability to use proper nouns<br />
Real Case:      One user walked up to a certain Armenian pod manager and <br />
		said, "I can't get what I want!"  The pod manager leaned <br />
		back, put his hands on his belt-buckle, and said, "Well, <br />
		ma'am, you've come to the right place."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mad Bomber -    "Well, I hit ALT-f6, shift-f8, CNTRL-f10, f4, and f9, and <br />
		now it looks all weird."<br />
Advantages:     Will try to find own solution to problems.<br />
Disadvantages:  User might have translated document to Navajo without <br />
		meaning to.<br />
Symptoms:       More than six stopped jobs in UNIX, a 2:1 code-to-letter <br />
		ratio in WordPerfect<br />
Real Case:      One user came in complaining that his WordPerfect document <br />
		was underlined.  When I used reveal codes on it, I found <br />
		that he'd set and unset underline more than fifty times in <br />
		his document.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frying Pan/Fire Tactician - "It didn't work with the data set we had, so I<br />
		fed in my aunt's recipe for key lime pie."<br />
Advantages:     Will usually fix error.<br />
Disadvantages:  'Fix' is defined VERY loosely here.<br />
Symptoms:       A tendancy to delete lines that get errors instead of <br />
		fixing them.<br />
Real Case:      One user complained that their program executed, but <br />
		didn't do anything.  The scon looked at it for twenty <br />
		minutes before realizing that they'd commented out EVERY <br />
		LINE.  The user said, "Well, that was the only way I could <br />
		get it to compile."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman -        "Last week, when the moon was full, the clouds were thick, <br />
		and formahaut was above the horizon, I typed f77, and lo, <br />
		it did compile."<br />
Advantages:     Gives insight into primative mythology.<br />
Disadvantages:  Few scons are anthropology majors.<br />
Symptoms:       Frequent questions about irrelavent objects.<br />
Real Case:      One user complained that all information on one of their <br />
		disks got erased (as Norton Utilities showed nothing but <br />
		empty sectors, I suspect nothing had ever been on it).  <br />
		Reasoning that the deleted information went *somewhere*, <br />
		they wouldn't shut up until the scon checked four different <br />
		disks for the missing information.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
X-user -        "Will you look at those. . .um, that resolution, quite<br />
		impressive, really."<br />
Advantages:     Using the cutting-edge in graphics technology.<br />
Disadvantages:  Has little or no idea how to use the cutting-edge in <br />
		graphics technology.<br />
Symptoms:       Fuzzy hands, blindness<br />
Real Case:      When I was off duty, two users sat down in front of me at <br />
		DEC station 5000/200s that systems was reconfiguring.  I<br />
		suppressed my laughter while, for twenty minutes, they sat<br />
		down and did their best to act like they were doing exactly<br />
		what they wanted to do, even though they couldn't log in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miracle Worker - "But it read a file from it yesterday!"  'Sir, at a <br />
		guess, this disk has been swallowed and regurgitated.'  <br />
		"But I did that a month ago, and it read a file from it <br />
		yesterday!"<br />
Advantages:     Apparently has remarkable luck when you aren't around.<br />
Disadvantages:  People complain when scons actually use the word <br />
		'horse-puckey'.<br />
Symptoms:       Loses all ability to do impossible when you're around.  <br />
		Must be the kryptonite in your pocket.<br />
Real Case:      At least three users have claimed that they've loaded IBM<br />
		WordPerfect from Macintosh disks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Taskmaster -    "Well, this is a file in MacWrite.  Do you know how I can <br />
		upload it to MUSIC, transfer it over to UNIX from there, <br />
		download it onto an IBM, convert it to WordPerfect, and <br />
		put it in three-column format?"<br />
Advantages:     Bold new challanges.<br />
Disadvantages:  Makes one wish to be a garbage collector.<br />
Symptoms:       An inability to keep quiet.  Strong tendancies to make <br />
		machines do things they don't want to do.<br />
Real Case:      One user tried to get a scon to find out what another <br />
		person's E-mail address was even though the user didn't <br />
		know his target's home system, account name, or real name.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maestro -       "Well, first I sat down, like this.  Then I logged on, <br />
		like this, and after that, I typed in my password, like <br />
		this, and after that I edited my file, like this, and <br />
		after that I went to this line here, like this, and after <br />
		that I picked my nose, like this. . ."<br />
Advantages:     Willing to show you exactly what they did to get an error.<br />
Disadvantages:  For as long as five or six hours.<br />
Symptoms:       Selective deafness to the phrases, "Right, right, okay, <br />
		but what was the ERROR?", and a strong fondness for the <br />
		phrase, "Well, I'm getting to that."<br />
Real Case:      I once had to spend half an hour looking over a user's <br />
		shoulder while they continuously retrieved a document <br />
		into itself and denied that they did it (the user was <br />
		complaining that their document was 87 copies of the same <br />
		thing).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Princess (unfair, perhaps, as these tend, overwhelmingly, to be males) -<br />
		"I need a Mac, and someone's got the one I like reserved,<br />
		would you please garrote him and put him in the paper<br />
		recycling bin?"<br />
Advantages:     Flatters you with their high standards for your service.<br />
Disadvantages:  Impresses you with their obliviousness to other people on<br />
		this planet.<br />
Symptoms:       Inability to communicate except by complaining.<br />
Real Case:      One asked a scon to remove the message of the day because <br />
		he (the user) didn't like it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Complete Idiot -  "Why can't I copy this 25 megabyte text file onto a <br />
		360K floppy disk?"<br />
Advantages:  	Believe anything that you tell them, because they don't<br />
		have a clue.  Often observed wearing aluminum foil<br />
		under hat or garlic around neck to ward off evil<br />
		computer viruses.<br />
Disadvantages:  Cannot follow directions.  Doesn't grasp simple concepts,<br />
		like the meaning of the word "no."<br />
Symptoms:       Holding hands under monitor during power failure,       <br />
		hoping to catch letters as they fall off of screen.<br />
	      	Also observed playing Van Halen tape in Commodore-64<br />
		cassette drive, trying to get a transcript of the lyrics.<br />
		Most likely to have a bottle of white out next to monitor.<br />
Real Case:      User once wrote program for simulations class that<br />
		created 25 megabyte output file of every possible way to<br />
		safely put 8 queens on a chess board, using "*"'s to draw<br />
		board. Insisted that instructor wanted this printed and<br />

		User wouldn't take the hint when her access to all line<br />
		printers was revoked after trying to print this file 4<br />

		daisywheel printer.  Result: 14 pages of output and a<br />
		broken "*" on the printwheel before the file and program<br />

		Fourth year computer science student that couldn't figure<br />

An application was for employment<br />

A program was a television show<br />
<br />
Windows were something you hated to clean,<br />
<br />
A keyboard was a piano<br />
<br />
A cursor used profanity<br />
<br />
Memory was something you lost with age<br />
<br />
A CD was a bank account<br />
<br />
And if you had a 3 1/2 floppy you hoped no one found out <br />
<br />
Compress was something you did to garbage <br />
<br />
If you unzipped in public you went to jail<br />
<br />
Log on was adding wood to a fire<br />
<br />
A hard drive was a long trip on the road<br />
<br />
A mouse pad was where a mouse lived<br />
<br />
And a backup happened to your toilet<br />
<br />
Cut you did with scissors<br />
  <br />
Paste you did with glue <br />

A web was a spider's home <br />

   </div><div>1) I will have a cup of coffee in the morning and read my newspaper like I used to, before the Internet.  <br />
<br />
2) I will eat breakfast with a knife and fork and not with one hand typing.  <br />
<br />
3) I will get dressed before noon.  <br />
<br />
4) I will make an attempt to clean the house, wash clothes, and plan dinner before even thinking of the Internet.  <br />
<br />
5) I will sit down and write a letter to those unfortunate few friends and family that are Internet-deprived.  <br />
<br />
6) I will call someone on the phone who I cannot contact via the Internet.  <br />
<br />
7) I will read a book...if I still remember how.  <br />
<br />
8) I will listen to those around me and their needs and stop telling them to turn the TV down so I can hear the music on the Internet.  <br />
<br />
9) I will not be tempted during TV commercials to check for email.  <br />
<br />
10) I will try and get out of the house at least once a week, if it is necessary or not.  <br />
<br />
11) I will remember that my bank is not forgiving if I forget to balance my checkbook because I was too busy on the Internet. <br />
<br />
12) Last, but not least, I will remember that I must go to bed sometime...and the Internet will always be there tomorrow!<br />

<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Gentlemen, the summer grows hot, and it is<br />
essential that we complete this Declaration of Independence.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: Wait a minute, Thomas. I have to reboot here.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: That's all right, Ben. We'll go on without you.<br />
Has everyone had a chance to look at the draft I posted<br />
yesterday?<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: Not yet, Thomas, I've been having Notes<br />
replication problems.<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: Here, Roger, I brought a hard copy.<br />
Mr. Sherman: Thanks... saaaaay, nice font.<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: Do you like it? I downloaded it off Colonies<br />
Online just last week.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Gentlemen! There is work to be done. I fear<br />
our document will soon leak out.<br />
<br />
Mr. Livingston: Too late, Thomas. There's already a bootleg<br />
circulating. I saw it posted on alt.georgeIII.sucks last night.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: @#$$%^$# General Protection Fault!<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: Ben, you might try upgrading to Windows 75.<br />
It solved that problem for me.<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: Thomas, the part here about the Acts of<br />
Pretended Legislation; have you considered using bullets<br />
to air out the text?<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: I can fix that easily enough. Drat! I've spilled<br />
candle wax on my keyboard again.<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: You know, Thomas, that wouldn't happen if you'd<br />
buy an active-matrix screen.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: Hard-disk failure?!? Aw, criminy!!<br />
<br />
Mr. Livingston: Are you sure it's "unalienable rights"? My<br />
spell checker recommends "unassailable".<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Can we stick to the substance of the document,<br />
please? Shoot. Low battery. Anyone got a spare power cable?<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: What have you got, a Toshiba? No, mine isn't<br />
compatible.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: Hello, PCs Philadelphia? What does it mean<br />
when the floppy drive buzzes? OK, I'll hold.....<br />
<br />
Mr. Livingston: The "In Congress" part here at the top; have<br />
you thought about blowing that up really big and maybe<br />
centering it in 72 point Helvetica?<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Not a bad idea. Aw, nuts! Word macro virus!<br />
I can't save the file.<br />

   </div><div>Diary of an AOL User<br />
<br />
<br />
July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is<br />
the best online service I can get.  They even included a free disk!  I'd<br />
better hold onto it incase they don't ever send me anther one!  I<br />
can't connect. I don't know what is wrong.<br />
<br />
July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a<br />
modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he<br />
think I am?<br />
<br />
July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It<br />
wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.<br />
<br />
July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old<br />
next door did it for me. But it still don't work. I cant get online.<br />
<br />
July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America<br />
Online for me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy.  But he<br />
says that's just another service. What a modest kid.  He's so smart and<br />
he does these services for people.  Anyway he's smarter then the jerks<br />
who sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications<br />
software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack<br />
holes in the back of a modem when you only need one?  And why do they<br />
have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the phone<br />
jack on the wall?  I thought the dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are modem<br />
makers dumb!  But the kid figured it out by the sound.<br />
<br />
July 26 - What's the internet?  I thought I was on America Online. Not<br />
this internet thing. I'm confused.<br />
<br />
July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this<br />
America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he is<br />
compared to me.  Maybe he's not so modest after all.<br />
<br />
July 28 - I tried to use chat today.  I tried to talk into my computer<br />
but nothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone.<br />
<br />
July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'm<br />
connected to America Online not usenet.<br />
<br />
July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters. <br />
How do they do that?  I never figured out how to type capital letters.<br />
Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.<br />
<br />
JULY 31 -  I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN<br />
ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS<br />
THIS CAPS LOCK KEY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A<br />
CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT<br />
THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I<br />
DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN<br />
IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS<br />
TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT<br />
CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT<br />
THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKE<br />
ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA!<br />
HA! I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERS<br />
GREW THAT LARGE.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE.<br />
I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO<br />
REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE<br />
TIMES.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE<br />
PROFANITY.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES.<br />
WHAT A STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING!<br />
HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET?<br />
<br />
August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it? Its<br />
probably an extra feature that costs more money.<br />
<br />
August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited.<br />
I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted<br />
it to every newsgroup I could find.<br />
<br />
August 9 - I just made my signature file.  Its only 6 pages long. I will<br />
have to work on it some more.<br />
<br />
August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.aol.sucks. I read a few<br />
posts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of the<br />
earth. I wonder what an aol is.<br />
<br />
August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about something.<br />
 Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked and looked<br />
but I can't find that group.<br />
<br />
August 12 - I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet asking<br />
where the ftp.netcom.com is. hopefully someone will help. I cant ask the<br />
kid next door. His parents said that when he comes back from my house<br />
he's laughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework. So they<br />
wont let him come over anymore. I do have a great sense of humor. I<br />
don't know why the rec.humor group didn't like my chicken joke. Maybe<br />
they only like dirty stuff. Some people sent me posts about my 56 posts<br />
of the joke and they used bad words.<br />
<br />
August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internet<br />
asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. I had forgot yesterday to include my<br />
new signature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will want<br />
to read my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add that<br />
short story I like.<br />
<br />
August 14 - Some guy suspended my account because of what I was doing. I<br />
told him I don't have an account at his bank. He's so dumb.<br />

   </div><div>A computer was something on TV <br />
From a science fiction show of note <br />
A window was something you hated to clean <br />
And ram was the cousin of a goat. <br />
<br />
Meg was the name of my girlfriend <br />
And gig was a job for the nights <br />
Now they all mean different things <br />
And that really mega bytes. <br />
<br />
An application was for employment <br />
A program was a TV show <br />
A cursor used profanity <br />
A keyboard was a piano. <br />
<br />
Memory was something that you lost with age <br />
A CD was a bank account <br />
And if you had a 3-inch floppy <br />
You hoped nobody found out. <br />
<br />
Compress was something you did to the garbage <br />
Not something you did to a file <br />
And if you unzipped anything in public <br />
You'd be in jail for a while. <br />
<br />
Log on was adding wood to the fire <br />
Hard drive was a long trip on the road <br />
A mouse pad was where a mouse lived <br />
And a backup happened to your commode. <br />
<br />
Cut you did with a pocketknife <br />
Paste you did with glue <br />
A web was a spider's home <br />
And a virus was the flu. <br />
<br />
I'll stick to my pad and paper <br />
And the memory in my head <br />
No one's been killed in a computer crash <br />
But it makes their face turn red! <br />

	Costello:  No, I told you, I want to turn it off.<br />
	Abbott:  I know, you press the Start button-<br />
	Costello:  Wait a second. I want to turn it off. Off. I know how to start<br />
  		it. So tell me what to do.<br />
	Abbott:  I did.<br />
	Costello:  When?<br />
	Abbott:  When I told you to press the Start button.<br />
	Costello:  Why should I press the Start button?<br />
	Abbott:  To shut off the computer.<br />
	Costello:  I press Start to stop.<br />
	Abbott:  Well Start doesn't actually stop the computer.<br />
	Costello:  I knew it! So what do I press.<br />
	Abbott:  Start<br />
	Costello:  Start what?<br />
	Abbott:  Start button.<br />
	Costello:  Start button to do what?<br />
	Abbott:  Shut down.<br />
	Costello:  You don't have to get rude!<br />
	Abbott:  No, no, no! That's not what I meant.<br />
	Costello:  Then say what you mean.<br />
	Abbott:  To shut down the computer, press-<br />
	Costello:  Don't say, "Start!"<br />
	Abbott:  Then what do you want me to say?<br />
	Costello:  Look, if I want to turn off the computer, I'm willing to press the <br />
  		Stop button, the End button and Cease and Desist button, but no one<br />
  		in their right mind presses the Start to Stop.<br />
	Abbott:  But that's what you do.<br />
	Costello:  And you probably Go at Stop signs, and Stop at green lights.<br />
	Abbott:  Don't be ridiculous.<br />
	Costello:  I am being ridiculous? Well. I think it's about time we started<br />
		this conversion.<br />
	Abbott:  What are you talking about?<br />
	Costello:  I am starting this conversation right now. Good-bye.<br />

   </div><div>Abort, Retry, Ignore?<br />
<br />
<br />
 Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,<br />
 System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,<br />
 Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there doing <br />
	spreadsheets.<br />
 Having reached the bottom line I took a floppy from the drawer,<br />
 I then invoked the SAVE command and waited for the disk to store,<br />
 Only this and nothing more.<br />
<br />
 Deep into the monitor peering, long I sat there wond'ring, fearing,<br />
 Doubting, while the disk kept churning, turning yet to churn some more.<br />
 But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token.<br />
 "Save!" I said, "You cursed mother!  Save my data from before!"<br />
 One thing did the phosphors answer, only this and nothing more,<br />
 Just, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"<br />
<br />
 Was this some occult illusion, some maniacal intrusion?<br />
 These were choices undesired, ones I'd never faced before.<br />
 Carefully I weighed the choices as the disk made impish noises.<br />
 The cursor flashed, insistent, waiting, baiting me to type some more.<br />
 Clearly I must press a key, choosing one and nothing more,<br />
 From "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"<br />
<br />
 With fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending,<br />
 Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,<br />
 Praying for some guarantee, timidly, I pressed a key.<br />
 But on the screen there still persisted words appearing as before.<br />
 Ghastly grim they blinked and taunted, haunted, as my patience wore,<br />
 Saying "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"<br />
<br />
 I tried to catch the chips off guard, and pressed again, but twice as <br />
	hard.<br />
 I pleaded with the cursed machine: I begged and cried and then I swore.<br />
 Now in mighty desperation, trying random combinations,<br />
 Still there came the incantation, just as senseless as before.<br />
 Cursor blinking, angrily winking, blinking nonsense as before.<br />
 Reading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"<br />
<br />
 There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted.<br />
 Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor.<br />
 And then I saw a dreadful sight: a lightning bolt cut through the night.<br />
 A gasp of horror overtook me, shook me to my very core.<br />
 The lightning zapped my previous data, lost and gone forevermore.<br />
 Not even, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"<br />
<br />
 To this day I do not know the place to which lost data go.<br />
 What demonic nether world us wrought where lost data will be stored,<br />
 Beyond the reach of mortal souls, beyond the ether, into black holes?<br />
 But sure as there's C, Pascal, Lotus, Ashton-Tate and more,<br />
 You will be one day be left to wander, lost on some Plutonian shore,<br />
 Pleading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"<br />
<br />

	One fine evening, Abraham the patriarch (you remember him) was <br />
	busy in his tent loading Windows-95 on his PC when Isaac, his <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Isaac takes one look and exclaims, "Hey, Pop! <br />
	What you're doing won't work. For Windows-95 you need at least <br />
	a fast 486, at least 60 megabytes free on your hard drive, and <br />
	lots more memory than you have here." <br />
<br />
Abraham <br />
	replies, "Isaac, Isaac my son. I'm an old man and not in much <br />
	of a hurry so my 386 will be just fine. I've got plenty of <br />
	space on my hard drive. And, you shouldn't worry about the <br />

Subject:Addicted To Vi <br />
After reading about a poor wretch who had become addicted to vi, I was inspired to compose the following ditty, sung to the tune of "Addicted To Love" by Robert Palmer. <br />
<br />
As you sing this, it may help the effect to imagine a dozen women, all of whom resemble Bill Joy, dressed in black and dancing sinuously. <br />
<br />
<br />
Addicted To Vi<br />
(with apologies to Robert Palmer) <br />
You press the keys with no effect,<br />
Your mode is not correct.<br />
The screen blurs, your fingers shake;<br />
You forgot to press escape.<br />
Can't insert, can't delete,<br />
Cursor keys won't repeat.<br />
You try to quit, but can't leave,<br />
An extra "bang" is all you need. <br />
<br />
You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die<br />
You know you're gonna have to face it;<br />
You're addicted to vi! <br />
<br />
You edit files one at a time;<br />
That doesn't seem too out of line?<br />
You don't think of keys to bind--<br />
A meta key would blow your mind.<br />
H, J, K, L? You're not annoyed?<br />
Expressions must be a Joy!<br />
Just press "f", or is it "t"?<br />
Maybe "n", or just "g"? <br />
<br />
Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die<br />
You know you're gonna have to face it;<br />
You're addicted to vi! <br />
<br />
Might as well face it,<br />
You're addicted to vi! <br />
<br />
You press the keys without effect,<br />
Your life is now a wreck.<br />
What a waste! Such a shame!<br />
And all you have is vi to blame. <br />
<br />
Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--<br />
Oh yeah?<br />
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die<br />
You know you're gonna have to face it;<br />
You're addicted to vi! <br />
<br />
Might as well face it,<br />
You're addicted to vi! <br />

<br />
<br />
Scientists this week decoded the first confirmed alien transmission from<br />
outer space. Here is the text of the message that they decoded:<br />
<br />
"This really works!  Just send 5*10^50 atoms of hydrogen to each of the five<br />
star systems listed below.  Then, add your own system to the top of the<br />
list,  delete the system at the bottom, and send out copies of this message<br />
to 100 other solar systems.  If you follow these instructions, within 0.25<br />
of a galactic rotation you are guaranteed to receive enough hydrogen in<br />
return to power your civilization until entropy reaches its maximum!"<br />

   </div><div>Always Accessible<br />
by Joe Lavin<br />
<br />
<br />
I was given this new cell phone at work, but I'm starting to think it's <br />
defective. You see, it tends to ring a lot. Like, for example, I'll be minding <br />
my own business walking to lunch, and suddenly it'll just start ringing. <br />
Even worse, when I answer it, it'll often be someone asking me a question <br />
about work. I'm thinking of calling the manufacturer to see if they can fix <br />
it. It's really starting to bug me. <br />
<br />
Yes, like many others, I have been dragged kicking and screaming into <br />
the world of cellular phones. I long vowed I would never own a cell <br />
phone, and to be honest I still don't. My employer owns it. I'm just the <br />
one forced to carry it around.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's really not so bad. It is convenient, and the phone can even <br />
fit into the palm of my hand. It's a nifty little gadget, and part of me (the <br />
part that forgets how evil cell phones are) likes having it. Yes, I can be <br />
reached at any time, but I can also turn it off and let the calls go to voice <br />
mail. <br />
<br />
Of course, it's still tough to have a good excuse for ignoring the phone. <br />
<br />
"I called earlier, Joe, but you didn't answer."<br />
<br />
"Oh, sorry about that. I just went out for a second."<br />
<br />
"So what? You have a cell phone."<br />
<br />
"Um, I mean, I was in. That's it. I was in and couldn't get your call. Oh, <br />
damn the batteries are running low, and I think I'm walking into a tunnel. <br />
Let me get back to you."<br />
<br />
While I may look oh-so-important when walking around with my cell <br />
phone, the only reason that I have it is because I don't have a real phone. <br />
My new job at Harvard is to go around to different departments and help <br />
them pay bills with Harvard's new financial system. I'm rarely at my <br />
desk -- hence, the evil cell phone. <br />
<br />
I still feel squeamish about having it, and I have yet to make a call while <br />
in public. After all, I just don?t like having to subject others to my phone <br />
calls. On some days, I don?t even like subjecting myself to them.<br />
<br />
And whenever it does ring, I feel slightly embarrassed. Well, actually, <br />
first I look around confused for a second before exclaiming to whoever <br />
I'm with, "Oh, that's me!" I'm not at all prepared to conduct a business <br />
call while walking around. God forbid when someone actually gives me a <br />
number. The other day, if by chance you saw an idiot on a cell phone in <br />
the middle of Harvard Yard trying to use a tree as a writing surface for a <br />
piece of scrap paper, that was me. Luckily, I did get the proper <br />
information, but even then I managed somehow to schedule a meeting <br />
for my day off. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I really shouldn't feel so self-conscious. I'm certainly not <br />
alone. I'm simply one of over 70 million Americans with a cell phone. All <br />
over, cell phones are suddenly pervasive. More and more restaurant <br />
owners have been forced to ban cell phones so that people will stop <br />
yakking into them during meals. Many theater owners have complained <br />
about cell phones ringing in the middle of plays and movies. <br />
Increasingly, states are even considering laws restricting the use of car <br />
phones. <br />
<br />
And then there are the people at sporting events. Lately, I've been <br />
watching the baseball playoffs, and during most every game you will <br />
now see some loser sitting behind home plate with a cell phone waving <br />
at someone on the phone. I suppose it's an innocent act, but it still makes <br />
one yearn for a sudden foul ball.<br />
<br />
"Hi, Mom. It's me. I'm on TV. See me waving. Right where the foul ball is <br />
about to -- AAAAARGGHH!"<br />
<br />
Not that I should really wish such a thing on anyone, but there's <br />
something about cell phone users that most people hate. Well, let me <br />
correct that. Most people would hate them except that most people are <br />
now starting to own cell phones of their own, and so it becomes more <br />
difficult to hate the cell phone users. <br />
<br />
Especially for me. After all, if you want to reach my apartment, you can <br />
now do so with one of four different numbers. My roommate Anna and I <br />
have separate phone numbers, and each of us has a cell phone too. <br />
<br />
I have a feeling that we might just be a little too connected to the world. <br />
You think?<br />

<br />
<br />
The tech support problem dates back to long before the<br />
industrial revolution, when primitive tribesmen beat out<br />
a rhythm on drums to communicate:<br />
<br />
This fire help.  Me Groog<br />
<br />
Me Lorto.    Help.  Fire not work.<br />
<br />
You have flint and stone?<br />
<br />
Ugh<br />
<br />
You hit them together?<br />
<br />
Ugh<br />
<br />
What happen?<br />
<br />
Fire not work<br />
<br />
(sigh) Make spark?<br />
<br />
No spark, no fire, me confused. Fire work yesterday.<br />
<br />
*sigh* You change rock?<br />
<br />
I change nothing<br />
<br />
You sure?<br />
<br />
Me make one change. Stone hot so me soak in stream so stone<br />
not burn Lorto hand.<br />
Small change, shouldn't keep Lorto from make fire.<br />
<br />
*Grabs club and goes to Lorto's cave*<br />

   </div><div>If AOL Was a City<br />
<br />
<br />
	You'd live in a place where no two people had the same name, and all<br />
	were h0t 17/f cheerleaders with a fetish for pierced gay Dobermans in<br />
	spandex. <br />
<br />
	You'd only pay $19.95 a month to live there, but half the time you<br />
	tried to leave your house, the door would be stuck. <br />
<br />
	Once you got outside, even if you were in a hurry, you'd be assaulted <br />
	by slimy little door-to-door salescreeps offering you great AOL <br />
	14.4 modems for only $399.99<br />
<br />
	The commute to work is just a double-click away, but every time you<br />
	try to leave your driveway, the flow of traffic knocks you back into<br />
	your yard.<br />
<br />
	48 hours after moving in, your mailbox would be overflowing with<br />
	special offers, promotions and discounts from www.cuntsmack.com<br />
<br />
	The local post office would tell your mother you're not a known<br />
	resident.<br />
<br />
	The local post office won't forward your mail to you when you move. <br />
<br />
<br />
	The administration would kick you out of town for cursing after one<br />
	of those brutal toe stubs. <br />
<br />
	If you saw a crime and called 911, they'd reply a week later with a<br />
	form letter saying how you "really are important you are to us". <br />
<br />
	The administration would tell your boss to either pay up, or move<br />
	his slack-ass company somewhere else. <br />
<br />
	Everyone on the street would have something to do with kiddy porn,	<br />
	and this business would account for 75% of all city revenue. <br />
<br />
	Every time you went to the mall, people would run up to you and<br />
	violently scream M/F??!!, AGE/SEX?!?! or g0t PH1SH d3wd?!11 while<br />
	little kids called your cell phone saying "Wanna FUCK?" <br />
<br />
	Those that didn't do that would call you and say " Hi, I'm j0e hax0r<br />
	from the town council. We had a database crash and lost your tax<br />
	records. Please give us your address and the key to your house or we<br />
	will be forced to evict you and your family." <br />
<br />
	Every time you went shopping, you'd be kicked out of the store by a<br />
	bouncer screaming 'WE'RE SORRY, THIS STORE IS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE"<br />
<br />
<br />
	Whenever you traveled to other cities, people would see your license<br />
	tag and laugh behind your back. <br />
<br />
	Even your 3 year old son would know the intimate personal details of<br />
	the town security expert.     <br />
<br />
	You'd occasionally be sent home during your day by another bouncer<br />
	telling you that the city has performed an illegal operation, but that<br />
	it's really the Earth's fault.<br />
<br />
	The local McDonalds sign would be realistically changed to "McHax0r<br />
	Wuz H3r3" and "Gr33tz 2 K}It0sawruz" almost daily. Police don't<br />
	investigate, but do show up with little scrubby tools, or just remove<br />
	the sign altogether. <br />
<br />
	Half the kids in the daycare you use are thinly disguised fat, hairy, <br />
	drooling, diapered men holding sacks of candy. <br />
<br />
	Your daughter would disappear to the No-Tell Motel every night, and<br />
	you'd foot the bill. <br />
<br />
	Putting up controversial art in your home would result in the police<br />
	bashing in your door, throwing your ass on the floor, and kicking the<br />
	shit out of you while saying "Ya got two chances left, jerk.<br />
	ROFLMAO LOL!!" <br />
	<br />
	You'd send your kids to school for history, math and science, but<br />
	they'd wind up studying ph1shing, one-handed typing, and annoying<br />
	acronyms.<br />
<br />
	You'd not have any idea who your neighbors are, and most new<br />
	arrivals would move in at night, stuff everyone's mailbox with crap,<br />
	and vacate before sunup. <br />
<br />
	The administration would secretly sell off chunks of their personal<br />
	land in the city, while buying up neighboring cities with imaginary<br />
	funds.<br />
<br />
	The administration would build a huge, state of the art park, and<br />
	allow the kids to play there free, then suddenly demanding money while<br />
	ripping down the swings and beating the fuck out of kids currently<br />
	playing there.<br />
<br />
	Don't forget the AOL playground, which is locked so that the kiddies<br />
	can not get out "for safety reasons", and then hordes of perverts &<br />
	pedophiles are allowed in.<br />
<br />
	The police would work for free out of some sort of "duty" to the<br />
	city, but would secretly only be doing it for the free food stamps. <br />
<br />
	Upon waking every morning, a voice from above would shout "HEY! YOU<br />
	DO WANT A STINKIN' AOL VISA, DON'T YOU?" To which you say "no". The<br />
	voice then replies "OK, I'LL ASK YOU TOMORROW". <br />
<br />
	A trip to the local library would find you a few ancient doom 2<br />
	patches, commercial pix of Pamela Anderson Lee, and a viral copy of<br />
	PkZip 2.04g<br />
<br />
	Community events would be periodically interrupted because of the<br />
	speaker randomly flying out of the meeting hall and appearing several<br />
	minutes later with some stupid comment about a Punt Monster. <br />
<br />
	Your neighbors would be called to leave on pilgrimages to a mystical<br />
	land called USENET, where they would bleat the virtues of your fair<br />
	city. <br />
<br />
	Somewhere in another city, David Cassel would be sitting with a<br />
	telescope trained on City Hall, smiling contentedly. <br />

<br />
<br />
AOL      America On Line (TM) A grand scheme for democratizing<br />
         the INTERNET.  Let all the rabble participate, if<br />
         they've got the money.  Rumor has it that Rush Limbaugh,<br />
         fer crying out loud, uses the service.<br />
<br />
AoL      America Off Line (SM)  Opps, too many to handle.  The<br />
         service is about to crash...<br />
<br />
AOL      (as in AOL.COM) Cryptic address which marks the<br />
         addressee as {probably} a bumptious newby who, like some<br />
         icky younger sibling, will breathlessly proffer the<br />
         electronic equivalent of a 5th generation photo-copy<br />
         (identified by all them >>>>>>s in the text) of some<br />
         tired old joke as hot new humor.<br />
<br />
AOL      (ca. 12/96) America On Line (TM) now with unlimited<br />
         access for a set fee.  Kinda reminds one of those old<br />
         Nuclear Energy commercials where they said that<br />
         electricity would become so cheap there would be no need<br />
         to meter it!  Too much of a good thing?<br />
<br />
AOL      Americans Outta Luck  Thousands, nay millions, of them<br />
         sitting there trying to get online and not being able<br />
         to.  Still, ya gotta wonder, just how many bought the<br />
         service and installed the software without realizing<br />
         that your computer needs to have a modem on it for you<br />
         to get to the INTERNET?<br />
<br />
AOL      Americans Organizing Law Suits.  That's the ticket!<br />
         Finally the masses are revolting.<br />

   </div><div>Bye Bye to America Online<br />
[To the tune of "American Pie"]<br />
<br />
<br />
A long, long, time ago<br />
  I can still remember when I dialed up their help desk lines.<br />
And I knew if I had the chance<br />
  They could make my modem dance<br />
with chats and GIFs and silly pick-up lines.<br />
<br />
But Help Desk phone calls made me shiver<br />
  with every busy they'd deliver.<br />
Bad news on the front page<br />
  A 19-hour outrage.<br />
<br />
I can't remember if I cried<br />
  when I realized that Steve Case had lied.<br />
But something touched me deep inside<br />
The day<br />
the service<br />
died.<br />
<br />
<br />
So bye bye to Amer'ca Online<br />
Drove my modem to a domain and it's working just fine.<br />
And good old geeks are cheering users offline<br />
Saying this'll be the day that they die.<br />
This'll be the day that they die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you write the book of TOS<br />
  Will you send your password to PWD-BOSS<br />
If an IM tells you so.<br />
<br />
And will you believe the Motley Fool<br />
  When he tells you that the service rules<br />
And can you teach me how to Web real slow?<br />
<br />
	Well I know you sold the service short<br />
	Cause I saw your quarterly report.<br />
<br />
	Steve Case sold off his stock<br />
	It fell just like a rock.<br />
<br />
It was a crazy, costly high-tech play<br />
As they slashed away at what subscribers pay<br />
And half their users went away<br />
the day the service died.<br />
<br />
<br />
	So bye bye to Amer'ca Online<br />

<br />
<br />
Well for two days we've been on our own<br />
  And dial-ins click on a rolling phone<br />
But that's not how it used to be<br />
<br />
When the mogul came to Virginia court<br />
  With an OS icon and a browser port<br />
And a desktop that looked like Apple III.<br />
<br />
	And while Jim Clark was looking down<br />
	The mogul stole his thorny crown<br />
<br />
	The browser war was turned.<br />
	Mozilla...was spurned.<br />
<br />
And while Steve left users out to bond<br />
With hosts unable to respond<br />
6 million newbies all were conned<br />
the day the service died.<br />
<br />
<br />
	So bye bye to Amer'ca Online<br />

	This'll be the day that they die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Da Chronic ducked their software guards<br />
  And stole a million credit cards<br />
To use accounts he'd gotten free.<br />
<br />
And so Steve Case went to the FBI<br />
  and he told Boardwatch* a little lie<br />
That hackers wanted child pornography *<br />
<br />
	But while Steve Case was looking down<br />
	The hackers pulled his e-mail down<br />
<br />
	They put it on the net.<br />
	He can't be trusted yet!<br />
<br />
And while user cynicism climbs<br />
At sign-on ads and welcome rhymes<br />
They scan their e-mail for "Good Times"<br />
the day the service died.<br />
<br />
<br />
	So bye bye to Amer'ca Online<br />

<br />
Helter-skelter billing needs a melter<br />
  The lawyers filed a class-action shelter<br />
Eight million in lawyer's fees.<br />
<br />
But it looks like some attorney jibe<br />
  an hour if they resubscribe.<br />
To a service marketed for free<br />
<br />
	Well I KNOW you're raking in the bucks<br />
	Cause I'm reading alt.aol-sucks.<br />
<br />
	"Until we bless the suit<br />
	The settlement is moot."<br />
<br />
"If AOL treats you like the Borg<br />
Then visit aolsucks.org<br />
Before some router pulls the cord..."<br />
the day the service died.<br />
<br />

Bill Razzouk, the head-to-be<br />
  sold off his home in Tennessee<br />
And headed for a 4-month end.<br />
<br />
Was he sad or just incensed<br />
  when Case offered him his thirty cents.<br />
Billing is the devil's only friend.<br />
<br />
	But as I read him on the page<br />
	My hands were clenched in fists of rage.<br />
<br />
	No "Welcome" born in hell<br />
	could ring that chatroom bell.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as chat freaks cried into the night<br />
CompuServe read their last rites.<br />
I saw Earthlink laughing with delight<br />
the day the service died.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I met a girl in Lobby 9<br />
  And I asked her if she'd stay on-line.<br />
But she just frowned and looked away.<br />
<br />
And I went back to the Member Lounge<br />
  To see what loyalty I could scrounge<br />
But Room Host said the members went away...<br />
<br />
	And on the net the modems scream<br />
	At faster speeds and data streams.<br />
<br />
	And not a tear was spoken.<br />
	The hourly fees were broken.<br />
<br />
And the three men that I hated most<br />
Ted, and Steve, and Razzouk's ghost<br />
They couldn't dial up the host<br />
The day the service died.<br />

		I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her car. <br />
<br />
		"Do you need  some help?" I asked. <br />
<br />
		She replied, "I knew I should have replaced the battery in this <br />

<br />
		"Hmmm, I dunno. Do you have an alarm, too?" I asked. <br />
<br />
		"No, just this remote 'thingy,'" she answered, handing it and <br />
		the car keys to me. <br />
<br />
		As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied, <br />
		"Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries ...<br />
		it's a long walk."<br />

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale<br />
Of the doom that is our fate.<br />
That started when programmers used<br />
Two digits for a date<br />
Two digits for a date<br />
<br />
RAM memory was smaller then;<br />
Hard drives were tiny, too.<br />
"Four digits are extravagant,<br />
So let's get by with two.<br />
So let's get by with two."<br />
<br />
"This works through 1999,"<br />
The programmers did say.<br />
"Unless we write new code by then<br />
The data goes away.<br />
The data goes away."<br />
<br />
But management had not a clue;<br />
"It works fine now, you bet!<br />
Rewriting code cost money,<br />
We won't do it just yet.<br />
We won't do it just yet."<br />

   </div><div><pre> From the Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, March 1, 1994.<br />
 Reprinted without permission<br />
 <br />
AUSTIN, Texas -  The exasperated help-line caller said she couldn't get<br />
her new Dell computer to turn on.  Jay Ablinger, a Dell Computer Corp.<br />
technician, made sure the computer was plugged in and then asked the<br />
woman what happened when she pushed the power button.<br />
 <br />
"I've pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens," the<br />
woman replied.  "Foot pedal?" the technician asked.  "Yes," the woman<br />
said, "this little white foot pedal with the on switch."  The "foot<br />
pedal," it turned out, was the computer's mouse, a hand-operated device<br />
that helps to control the computer's operations.<br />
<br />
[boring stuff deleted] <br />
<br />
Only two years ago, most calls to PC help lines came from techies<br />
needing help on complex problems.  But now, with computer sales to homes<br />
exploding as new "multimedia" functions gain mass appeal, PC makers say<br />
that as many as 70% of their calls come from rank novices.  Partly<br />
because of the volume of calls, some computer companies have started<br />
charging help-line users.<br />
 <br />
[boring stuff deleted] <br />
<br />
John Wolf: "A frustrated customer called, who said her brand new Contura<br />
would not work.  She said she had unpacked the unit, plugged it in,<br />
opened it up and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to<br />
happen.  When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she<br />
asked, 'What power switch?'"<br />
 <br />
Seemingly simple computer features baffle some users.  So many people have<br />
called to ask where the "any" key is when "Press Any Key" flashes on the<br />
screen that Compaq is considering changing the command to "Press Return Key."<br />
<br />
Some people can't figure out the mouse.  Tamra Eagle, an AST technical<br />
support supervisor, says one customer complained that her mouse was hard<br />
to control with the "dust cover" on.  The cover turned out to be the<br />
plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.  Dell technician Wayne Zieschang<br />
says one of his customers held the mouse and pointed it at the screen,<br />
all the while clicking madly.  The customer got no response because the<br />
mouse works only if it's moved over a flat surface.<br />
 <br />
Disk drives are another bugaboo.  Compaq technician Brent Sullivan says<br />
a customer was having trouble reading word-processing files from his<br />
old diskettes.  After troubleshooting for magnets and heat failed to<br />
diagnose the problem, Mr. Sullivan asked what else was being done with<br />
the diskette.  The customer's response: "I put a label on the diskette,<br />
roll it into the typewriter..."<br />
 <br />
At AST, another customer dutifully complied with a technician's request that<br />
she send in a copy of a defective floppy disk.  A letter from the customer<br />
arrived a few days later, along with a Xerox copy of the floppy. And at<br />
Dell, a technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in<br />
the drive and "close the door." Asking the technician to "hold on," the<br />
customer put the phone down and was heard walking over to shut the<br />
door to his room.  The technician meant the door to his floppy drive.<br />
 <br />
The software inside the computer can be equally befuddling.  A Dell<br />
customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything.<br />
After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the technician discovered the man<br />
was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor<br />
screen and hitting the "send" key.<br />
 <br />
Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so Dell<br />
echnician Gary Rock referred him to the local Egghead.  "Yeah, I got me<br />
couple of friends," the customer replied.  When told Egghead was a<br />
software store, the man said, "Oh! I thought you meant for me to find a<br />
couple of geeks."<br />
 <br />
Not realizing how fragile computers can be, some people end up damaging<br />
parts beyond repair.  A Dell customer called to complain that his<br />
keyboard no longer worked.  He had cleaned it, he said, filling up his  <br />
     tub with soap and water and soaking his keyboard for a day, and<br />
then removing all the keys and washing them individually.<br />
 <br />
Computers make some people paranoid.  A Dell technician, Morgan Vergara, says<br />
he once calmed a man who became enraged because "his computer had told him he<br />
was bad and an invalid."  Mr. Vergara patiently explained that the computer's<br />
"bad command" and "invalid" responses shouldn't be taken personally.<br />
 <br />
These days PC-help technicians increasingly find themselves taking on<br />
the role of amateur psychologists.  Mr. Shuler, the Dell technician, who<br />
once worked as a psychiatric nurse, says he defused a potential domestic<br />
fight by soothingly talking a man through a computer problem after the<br />
man had screamed threats at his wife and children in the background.<br />
 <br />
There are also the lonely hearts who seek out human contact, even if it<br />
happens to be a computer techie.  One man from New Hampshire calls Dell<br />
every time he experiences a life crisis.  He gets a technician to walk<br />
him through some contrived problem with his computer, apparently feeling<br />
uplifted by the process.<br />

   </div><div>>If Bill Gates were killed in a car accident. He might<br />
find himself being sized up by God.<br />
<br />
"...Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call. I'm<br />
not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After<br />
all, you enormously helped society by putting a<br />
computer in almost every home in the world, and yet<br />
you created that ghastly Windows 95. I'm going to do<br />
something I've never done before. In your case, I'm<br />
going to let you decide where you want to go!"<br />
<br />
Bill replied, "Well, thanks, God. What's the difference<br />
between the two?"<br />
<br />
God said, "I'm willing to let you visit both places<br />
briefly if it will help you make a decision."<br />
<br />
"Fine, but where should I go first?"<br />
<br />
God said, "I'm going to leave that up to you."<br />
<br />
Bill said, "OK, then, let's try Hell first."<br />
<br />
So Bill went to Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy<br />
beach with clear waters.<br />
<br />
There were thousands of beautiful women running around,<br />
playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about.<br />
<br />
The sun was shining and the temperature was perfect.<br />
<br />
Bill was very pleased. "This is great!" he told God.<br />
"If this is Hell, I REALLY want to see Heaven!"<br />
<br />
"Fine," said God, and off they went.<br />
<br />
Heaven was a high place in the clouds, with angels<br />
drifting about playing harps and singing.<br />
<br />
It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.<br />
<br />
Bill thought for a quick minute and rendered his<br />
decision. "Hmm, I think prefer Hell," he told God.<br />
<br />
"Fine," retorted God, "as you desire."<br />
<br />
So Bill Gates went to Hell.<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, God decided to check up on the late<br />
billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell.<br />
<br />
When God arrived in Hell, he found Bill shackled to a<br />
wall, screaming amongst the hot flames in a dark cave.<br />
<br />
He was being burned and tortured by demons.<br />
<br />
"How's everything going, Bill?" God asked.<br />
<br />
Bill responded, his voice full of anguish and<br />
disappointment, "This is awful; this is NOT what I<br />
expected. I can't believe this happened. What happened<br />
to that other place with the beaches and the beautiful<br />
women playing in the water?"<br />
<br />
God says, "That was the screen saver."<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Computer_Diagnosis.html">Computer Diagnosis</a></h2>
   </div><div>   One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt.<br />
   His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that<br />
   can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.<br />
<br />
   ''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose<br />
   your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs<br />
   $10." Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a<br />
   urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he<br />
   poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started<br />
   making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief<br />
   pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: "You have<br />
   tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It<br />
   will be better in two weeks."<br />
<br />
   Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was<br />
   and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if<br />
   this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a<br />
   stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and<br />
   daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went<br />
   back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and<br />
   deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed<br />
   out the following message:<br />
<br />
   "Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms.<br />
   Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a<br />
   rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They<br />
   aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your<br />
   tennis elbow will never get better."<br />

   </div><div>The Computercist<br />
By Ian Wolff<br />
<br />
<br />
Although rare, computer possessions have lately been recorded at an<br />
increasingly alarming rate.  However, to date, the most celebrated case<br />
of (documented) computer possession took place on the evening of June<br />
23rd, 1997, in the small upscale town of Menlo Park, CA.  For the sake<br />
of the victim and his family he is referred to in the following case<br />
file simply as 'Tad.'<br />
<br />
(Case #27-198TAD Monday, Oct 23rd, 1997... 6:42pm)<br />
<br />
"I'm so glad you're here," said the beleaguered looking middle aged<br />
woman as she ushered the two gentlemen callers into her living room and<br />
bade them sit, "I'll just be a moment," she continued, hastening into<br />
the kitchen and returning with three steaming mugs of freshly brewed<br />
coffee.<br />
<br />
"Tell me what you can, Miss Snyder, I'd like to get started as soon as<br />
possible." Said Jacob, the more elderly of the two gentlemen.<br />
<br />
"It all started last night," she began, "Tad, that's my son's name,<br />
Tad.  Tad had been locked away in his room for the past three weeks, I<br />
thought he was just studying hard since his finals were coming up and<br />
all, so I left him alone.  Until last night, that is, that's when I<br />
entered his room and..." she began to tremble, tears rolled down her<br />
cheeks and she dropped her coffee mug to the floor with a crash.<br />
<br />
Karrass, the younger of the two gentlemen, leapt to her aid.  "There,<br />
there," he said, holding her tight and patting her on the back,<br />
"everything will be all right<br />
<br />
Jacob arose from the couch and taking the large black suitcase in hand,<br />
caught Karrass's gaze and motioned him towards the stairs.  "It's time,"<br />
he whispered, "come along now."<br />
<br />
They climbed the stairs quickly and Karrass reached for the boy's<br />
bedroom door.  "Stop!" hissed Jacob, "there are a few things we have to<br />
get straight first.  Number one, you'll have to keep IT busy while I<br />
install a surge protector."<br />
<br />
"A surge protector?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, trust me.  If the power goes, so goes the boy.  It happened to me<br />
once before and I'm still paying for it.  Not the child, the computer.<br />
"Do you know how much a fully loaded Compaq Impresario costs!"  Her<br />
father kept screaming in my face.  Meanwhile his daughter's soul had<br />
just been sucked into cyberhell.  It was very sad, not to mention<br />
expensive."<br />
<br />
"Gotcha, I'll keep it busy while you install the surge protector.<br />
Anything else?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, whatever you do, don't listen to it.  It will try and make you<br />
angry.  It will lie, twist your words, show you unflattering pictures of<br />
your loved ones on its monitor and tell you that your mother's in it's<br />
nudie files.  Do NOT believe IT!  Well, unless of course..."<br />
<br />
"NO," shrieked Karrass, "she couldn't be!"<br />
<br />
"Fine then, are you ready?"  Karrass nodded in the affirmative and the<br />
two men entered the room.  It was worse than Jacob had expected and<br />
nearly more than Karrass could take in.<br />
<br />
The boy lay prostrate upon the bed, a 56k modem was attached to the left<br />
side of his abdominal region, while several wires leading from multiple<br />
outlets looked to have installed themselves throughout every orifice the<br />
boy owned.  It seemed to Karrass as if the boy and the computer had<br />
become one.  The room stank of burnt wires and singed pubic hair.  The<br />
walls were awash with downloaded girlie pictures and more pornography,<br />
thought Jacob, than a Larry Flynt archive.  "I wonder what type of<br />
finals he was preparing for," whispered Karrass.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the monitor sprang to life and the hiss of the speakers filled<br />
the room.  "Nice day for a computercism," came the deep croaking voice,<br />
"we've been expecting you."<br />
<br />
Karrass pulled a chair next to the bed and sat down, he took the<br />
keyboard and placing it on his lap, typed "who are you?"<br />
<br />
"You have mail!" Blasted the speakers, followed by a wicked giggle.<br />
"Never mind who I am," it continued, "I'm not giving up the boy and<br />
that's all you need to know, Karrass.  That is your name isn't it?  And<br />
stop typing, I can hear you just fine, I'm wired to the little pinhead's<br />
eardrums."<br />
<br />
"What should we call you?" Asked Jacob, while covertly slipping the<br />
surge protector from the suitcase.  "If I tell you," came the voice and<br />
this time from the boy's own lips, "I'll have to kill you.  But if you<br />
must know, It's Mort."<br />
<br />
"MORT?" Chimed the two men.<br />
<br />
"Hey, you asked."<br />
<br />
"Do you know why we are here, Mort?" Asked Jacob, while installing the<br />
surge protector.  "I know why you THINK you're here," it responded, "but<br />
you're terribly mistaken, the NERD IS MINE!!"  Came another blast from<br />
the speakers, this time causing both men to cover their ears.  Jacob<br />
pulled a pair of wire cutters from the bag and snipped the speaker<br />
wires.  "Very sneaky," it said, now from the boy's mouth.  "Hey Karrass,<br />
look what your father's been up to."<br />
<br />
Karrass gazed at the monitor, there, in full color, was his very own<br />
father, dressed in a white teddy, a flowing pink negligee, and six-inch<br />
spiked black heels.<br />
<br />
"That's not my father!" Screamed Karrass.<br />
<br />
"Karrass!" Shouted Jacob, "what did I tell you!"  Karrass sat<br />
motionless, unable to peel his gaze from the hideous picture.  Jacob<br />
pulled a shirt from the closet and draped it over the monitor.<br />
"Karrass," he said, taking the man by the shoulders and shaking him<br />
violently, "snap out of it."<br />
<br />
Karrass gazed up at Jacob, his face drained of color, "did you see it,<br />
Jacob?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, it was horrible, but I warned you that might happen.  Besides, it<br />
could have been worse, it could have been MY father.  Actually the<br />
negligee seemed to fit quite well and as for the..."<br />
<br />
"Stop," Karrass interrupted, while placing both hands to his stomach,<br />
"no more, please."<br />
<br />
Jacob brought Karrass a glass of water from the connecting bathroom and<br />
delved into his bag, it was time to stop playing, he thought, and get<br />
down to some serious work.  He removed a small vile labeled 'Bill Gate's<br />
saliva' and popped the cap.  "Be gone from this child of the Internet!"<br />
He shouted, while flicking some of the vile's contents across the boy's<br />
body, the monitor, keyboard and modem.<br />
<br />
"AHHHHH It burns, it burns!" Screamed the unholy and writhing<br />
assemblage.  "Your mothers on my hard-drive Jacob!"  It shrieked,<br />
spitting a stream of keyboard cleaning solution into Jacob's face.<br />
<br />
Jacob continued, undaunted.  "You will leave this nerd now!  You will<br />
return this computer geek now!  By the almighty text of HTML, so be it<br />
written, so be you confused by it, and all things computerized<br />
accordingly shall confuse you...!"<br />
<br />
"Stop!" Howled the beast, it's wires now sparking and sending a bluish<br />
smoke into the air.  "The monitor turned completely around on it's axis,<br />
several floppy discs began flying about the room, one hitting Karrass<br />
squarely in the crotch, causing him to drop to the floor in agony.<br />
<br />
Jacob strove on, "Bill Gates compels you!  Steve Wozniak compels you!<br />
Steve Jobs compels you!"  With each incantation he thrust another<br />
sprinkling of saliva upon the beast.  "Henry Ford compels you!"<br />
<br />
"He made cars," moaned a still agonizing Karrass.<br />
<br />
"Oh right, sorry, I've been meaning to delete that.  Be gone from this<br />
boy you demon!"  It was working, the wires began detaching themselves<br />
from the boy.  "Jacob!" shouted an excited Karrass, "it's working!  Read<br />
from Genesis, Jacob.  Genesis!"<br />
<br />
Jacob flipped to the front of the book and began reading.  "In the<br />
beginning there was a garage, and Steve and Steve saw the garage, and<br />
they liked it, saying 'this is a good garage.  'DAMN!" He suddenly<br />
blurted, throwing the vile across the room.  "What is it?" Asked<br />
Karrass.  "No more saliva," replied Jacob.  "This happens every time he<br />
continued, while feverishly digging through the suitcase, "that's the<br />
trouble with billionaires, they can't produce enough saliva because they<br />
have nothing to salivate for!"<br />
<br />
Suddenly the boy sat up and thrust the mouse in Jacob's face, "click me,<br />
click me, click me," it repeated in a hideous croak, "click me!"  Jacob<br />
pushed the mouse away and pulling a floppy disk from his bag, held it<br />
before the boy's eyes.  The boy immediately recoiled and began to<br />
whimper, "please don't," it pleaded.  "Not a virus, please.  I'll be<br />
good, I promise, I'll give you fifteen free hours and unlimited access<br />
to Catholic Nymphos?"<br />
<br />
Jacob handed the disc to Karrass and ordered him to load it.  Then<br />
turning back to the beast, he fixed it with a steely glare and with a<br />
twinkle in his eye shouted "fax you and the mouse you clicked in on!"<br />
<br />
The two men stepped back as the virus began spreading like poison<br />
throughout the beast.  Random pictures began flashing across the<br />
monitor, Newt Gingrich, Keith Richards, Cool Whip, The official Vaseline<br />
page.<br />
<br />
"Oh there's a pretty picture," whispered Jacob, while Karrass clutched<br />
at his already overtaxed stomach.  Suddenly the room fell silent, the<br />
monitor went black and a thick blue smoke began streaming from the boy's<br />
ears.  "It's over," said Jacob, wiping the sweat from his brow.  Karrass<br />
approached the bed and leaned over the boy, "Tad?" He whispered.  The<br />
boy's eyes opened, "who are you?" He asked, "and where's my mother?"<br />
<br />
Meanwhile....<br />
<br />
Little Kathy dashed through her front door and ran straight away into<br />
her bedroom.  Life in little Ackle, New Zealand, had always been rather<br />
boring, she thought, that is until her parents had recently given in and<br />
bought her a brand new computer.  She booted up the system and watched<br />
as the pretty colors and 'way cool' graphics danced before her eyes.<br />
"You have Mail!" Hissed the speakers.  "Wow, cool!" She squealed, while<br />
leaning forward to read the name upon her screen.  "How totally weird,"<br />
she whispered, while clicking to open the file, "I don't know anyone<br />
named Mort."<br />

   </div><div>A computer geek loved a girl who studies computer science.<br />
 <br />
He sent a letter, saying:<br />
 <br />
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN MY COMPUTER Believe me it is true ...<br />
 <br />
You installed the best in me.<br />
 <br />
Your picture is always in my background.<br />
 <br />
You clicked my heart gently.<br />
 <br />
You drive me crazy when I see you.<br />
 <br />
Your love reset my life and deleted all the sadness in me.<br />
 <br />
You restored my kindness after I thought it was corrupted.<br />
 <br />
I'm always connected to you with more than 56 heart beat per second.<br />
 <br />
You hacked my brain and registered your name in it.<br />
 <br />
You are the only one that could navigate my feelings and explore my<br />
emotions at the same time.<br />
 <br />
I feel lost when I try to call you and you are not responding.<br />
 <br />
I always feel you close to me when I shut down my eyes, or when I open<br />
my windows waiting for you to pass.<br />
 <br />
You are the only one that can log into my heart and never log out. <br />
 <br />
I dream of being your only server as long as I live.<br />
 <br />
You don't have to search for me, cause we are always linked to each <br />
others.<br />
 <br />
I see your name everywhere, my front page, my homepage and all my<br />
software.<br />
 <br />
I scanned my life and found that I'm only infected by you.<br />
 <br />
You are the virus I'd never remove, and why should I do?<br />
 <br />
Believe me it is true...<br />
 <br />
I love you more than my CPU!!!! <br />

   </div><div>   Women claim that computers should be referred to in the masculine<br />
   gender because:<br />
   1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br />
   2. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br />
   3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time<br />
   they are the problem.<br />
   4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a<br />
   little longer you could have had a better model.<br />
   Men concluded that computers should be referred to in the feminine<br />
   gender because:<br />
   1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.<br />
   2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is<br />
   incomprehensible to everyone else.<br />
   3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for<br />
   retrieval.<br />
   4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending<br />
   half your paycheck on accessories for it.<br />

   </div><div>So you think you're computer-illiterate ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  1. Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to<br />
     "Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the <br />
     "Any" key is.<br />
<br />
  2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was <br />
     hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to <br />
     be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.<br />
<br />
  3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining<br />
     that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old<br />
     diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to<br />
     diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer labelled the<br />
     diskettes then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.<br />
   <br />
  4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective<br />
     diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer <br />
     along with Xeroxed copies of the floppies.<br />
<br />
  5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy<br />
     back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech <br />
     to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and <br />
     crossing the room to close the door to his room.<br />
     <br />
  6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer <br />
     to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the <br />
     technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper <br />
     by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the "send" <br />
     key.<br />
<br />
  7. Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so a<br />
     Dell tech suggested he go to the local Egghead. "Yeah, I got me a<br />
     couple of friends, "the customer replied. When told Egghead was a<br />
     software store, the man said, "Oh, I thought you meant for me to <br />
     find a couple of geeks."<br />
<br />
  8. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no<br />
     longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap <br />
     and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the <br />
     keys and washing them individually.<br />
<br />
  9. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged<br />
     because his computer had told him he was "bad and an invalid". The<br />
     tech explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid"<br />
     responses shouldn't be taken personally.<br />
<br />
 10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get<br />
     her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was<br />
     plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed <br />
     the power button. Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot <br />
     pedal and nothing happens." The "foot pedal" turned out to be the <br />
     computer's mouse.<br />
<br />
 11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new<br />
     computer wouldn't work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it <br />
     in, and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. <br />
     When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she <br />
     asked "What power switch?"<br />
<br />
 12. True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:<br />
<br />
     Caller: "Hello, is this Tech Support?"<br />
<br />
     Tech Rep: "Yes, it is. How may I help you?"<br />
<br />
     Caller: "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my <br />
          warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?"<br />
<br />
     Tech Rep: "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"<br />
<br />
     Caller: "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."<br />
<br />
     Tech Rep: "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's because <br />
          I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a  <br />
          trade show?  How did you get this cup holder? Does it have any <br />
          trademark on it?"<br />
<br />
     Caller: "It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a<br />
          promotional. It just has '4X' on it."<br />
<br />
     At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he <br />
     couldn't stand it. The caller had been using the load drawer of <br />
     the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive.<br />

    <br />

    <br />
    <br />

    important. Otherwise I wouldn't have sent them to you."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Well, sorry, but I lost them. I could say the dog ate them, <br />
    but of course you would see right through that."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "What do you mean 'you lost them! Are you trying to tell me <br />
    you didn't save them, Moses?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "No, sir. I forgot.  I was going to, but I forgot.  I did send <br />
    them to some people before I lost them though. "<br />

    harsh and recommended calling them the Ten Suggestions or <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    "Moses, I'll act like I didn't hear that."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "I think that means, 'no'. Well, what about the guy who said I     <br />
    was scamming him?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "I think that is spamming, Moses."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Oh, yeah. I e-mailed him back and told him I don't even eat <br />
    that stuff and I have no idea how you can send it to someone <br />
    through a computer."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "And what he did say?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "You know what he said. He used Your name in vain. You don't <br />
    think he might have sent me one of those plagues and that's <br />
    the reason I lost those ten things, do you?"<br />

    "Whatever! This computer stuff is just too much for me. Can <br />
    we just go back to those stone tablets? It was hard on my <br />
    back taking them out and reading them each day, but I never <br />
    lost them."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "We'll do it the new way, Moses."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "I was afraid you would say that, sir."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Moses, what did I tell you to do if you messed up?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "You told me to hold up this rat and stretch it out toward the  <br />
    computer."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "It's a mouse, Moses. Mouse! Mouse! And did you do that?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "No, I decided to try the technical support first. After all,  <br />
    who knows more about this stuff than you, and I really like    <br />
    your hours.  By the way, sir, did Noah have two of these mice    <br />
    on the ark?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "No, Moses."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "One other thing. Why didn't you name them frogs instead of mice,    <br />
    because didn't you tell me the thing they sit on is a pad?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "I didn't name them, Moses. Man did, and you can call yours a frog    <br />
    if you want to."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Oh, that explains it. Kind of like Adam, huh, sir? I bet some<br />
    woman told him to call it a mouse. After all, wasn't it a woman <br />
    who named one of the computers Apple?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Say good night, Moses."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Wait a minute, sir. I am stretching out the mouse and it seems to<br />
    be working. Yes, a couple of the ten things have come back."<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Which ones are they, Moses?"<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Let's see. 'Thou shalt not steal from any grave an image and    <br />
    'Thou shalt not uncover thy neighbor's wife.'<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    "Turn the computer off, Moses. I'm sending you another set of<br />
    stone tablets. How does 'Same Day Air' sound?"<br />
<br />

From ComputerWorld<br />
<br />
Ontrack Data Recovery in Eden Prairie, Minn., specializes in recovering<br />
data from hard drives damaged by natural or man-made disasters. Here are<br />
a few true stories from Ontrack's files:<br />
<br />
- One customer guessed that maybe his hard drive didn't work because it<br />
had been "sitting in a snowdrift by the barn for a while."<br />
<br />
- Another customer, concerned that he would void the warranty if he<br />
disassembled the hard drive by removing the screws, used a hack saw<br />
instead.<br />
<br />
- An Ontrack representative told a customer to pack his hard drive in<br />
peanuts for protection during shipping. The drive arrived the next day<br />
packed in salted peanuts - instead of foam peanuts.<br />
<br />
- Another drive arrived smelling fresh &amp; clean, wrapped in Bounce fabric<br />
softener sheets. The customer had been told to pack it with antistatic<br />
material before shipping.<br />

   </div><div>July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is<br />
the best online service I can get.  They even included a free disk! <br />
I'd better hold onto it incase they don't ever send me anther one!  I<br />
can't connect. I don't know what is wrong.<br />
<br />
July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a<br />
modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he<br />
think I am?<br />
<br />
July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It<br />
wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.<br />
<br />
July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old<br />
next door did it for me. But it still don't work. I cant get online.<br />
<br />
July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America<br />
Online for me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy.  But he<br />
says that's just another service. What a modest kid.  He's so smart and<br />
he does these services for people.  Anyway he's smarter then the jerks<br />
who sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications<br />
software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack<br />
holes in the back of a modem when you only need one?  And why do they<br />
have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the phone<br />
jack on the wall?  I thought the dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are<br />
modem makers dumb!  But the kid figured it out by the sound.<br />
<br />
July 26 - What's the internet?  I thought I was on America Online. Not<br />
this internet thing. I'm confused.<br />
<br />
July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this<br />
America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he<br />
is compared to me.  Maybe he's not so modest after all.<br />
<br />
July 28 - I tried to use chat today.  I tried to talk into my computer<br />
but nothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone.<br />
<br />
July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'm<br />
connected to America Online not usenet.<br />
<br />
July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters.<br />
How do they do that?  I never figured out how to type capital letters.<br />
Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.<br />
<br />
JULY 31 -  I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN<br />
ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS<br />
THIS CAPS LOCK KEY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A<br />
CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT<br />
THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I<br />
DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN<br />
IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS<br />
TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT<br />
CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS<br />
ABOUT THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS<br />
JOKE ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA!<br />
HA! I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERS<br />
GREW THAT LARGE.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS<br />
RUDE.  I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO<br />
REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE<br />
TIMES.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO<br />
USE PROFANITY.<br />
<br />
AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES.<br />
WHAT A STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING!<br />
HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET?<br />
<br />
August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it?<br />
Its probably an extra feature that costs more money.<br />
<br />
August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited.<br />
I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted<br />
it to every newsgroup I could find.<br />
<br />
August 9 - I just made my signature file.  Its only 6 pages long. I<br />
will have to work on it some more.<br />
<br />
August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.aol.sucks. I read a few<br />
posts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of the<br />
earth. I wonder what an aol is.<br />
<br />
August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about<br />
something.  Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked and looked<br />
but I can't find that group.<br />
<br />
August 12 - I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet asking<br />
where the ftp.netcom.com is. hopefully someone will help. I cant ask<br />
the kid next door. His parents said that when he comes back from my house<br />
he's laughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework. So they<br />
wont let him come over anymore. I do have a great sense of humor. I<br />
don't know why the rec.humor group didn't like my chicken joke. Maybe<br />
they only like dirty stuff. Some people sent me posts about my 56 posts<br />
of the joke and they used bad words.<br />
<br />
August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internet<br />
asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. I had forgot yesterday to include<br />
my new signature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will<br />
want to read my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add that<br />
short story I like.<br />
<br />
August 14 - Some guy suspended my account because of what I was doing.<br />
I told him I don't have an account at his bank. He's so dumb.<br />
<br />
<br />

 The following appeared in a computer magazine in Mr. Dvorak's column:<br />
 <br />
 Dear Mr. Dvorak:<br />
 <br />
 Ann Landers wouldn't print this.  I have nowhere else to turn.  I have<br />
 to get the word out. Warn other parents.  I must be rambling on. Let me <br />
 try and explain.  It's about my son, Billy.  He's always been a good, <br />
 normal ten-year-old boy.  Well, last spring we sat down after dinner to <br />
 select a summer camp for Billy.  We sorted through the camp brochures.  <br />
 There were the usual camps with swimming, canoeing, games, singing by the <br />
 campfire -- you know.  There were sports camps and specialty camps for <br />
 weight reduction, music, military camps and camps that specialized in <br />
 Tibetan knot tying.  I tried to talk him into Camp Winnepoopoo.  It's <br />
 where he went last year. (He made an adorable picture out of painted <br />
 pinto beans and macaroni).  Billy would have none of it.  Billy pulled a <br />
 brochure out of his pocket.  It was for a COMPUTER CAMP!  We should have <br />
 put our foot down right there, if only we had known.  He left three <br />
 weeks ago.  I don't know what's happened.  He's changed.  I can't explain <br />
 it.  See for yourself. These are some of my little Billy's letters.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 Dear Mom,<br />
      The kids are dorky nerds.  The food stinks.  The computers are the <br />
 only good part.  We're learning how to program.  Late at night is the <br />
 best time to program, so they let us stay up.<br />
                    Love, Billy.<br />
 <br />
 Dear Mom,<br />
      Camp is O.K.  Last night we had pizza in the middle of the night.  <br />
 We all get to choose what we want to drink.  I drink Classic Coke.  By <br />
 the way, can you make Szechuan food?  I'm getting used to it now.  Gotta <br />
 go, it's time for the flowchart class.<br />
                    Love, Billy.<br />
 P.S. This is written on a wordprocessor. Pretty swell, huh?  It's<br />
 spell-checked too.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Dear Mom,<br />
      Don't worry.  We do regular camp stuff.  We told ghost stories by <br />
 the glow of the green computer screens.  It was real neat.  I don't have <br />
 much of a tan 'cause we don't go outside very often.  You can't see the <br />
 computer screen in the sunlight anyway.  That wimp camp I went to last <br />
 year fed us weird food too. Lay off, Mom. I'm okay, really.<br />
                     Love, Billy.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Dear Mom,<br />
      I'm fine. I'm sleeping enough. I'm eating enough.  This is the best<br />
 camp ever.  We scared the counselor with some phony worm code.  It was <br />
 real funny.  He got mad and yelled.  Frederick says it's okay. Can you <br />
 send more money?  I spent mine on a pocket protector and a box of blank <br />
 diskettes.  I've got to chip in on the phone bill.  Did you know that <br />
 you can talk to people on a computer?  Give my regards to Dad.<br />
                     Love, Billy.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Dear Mother,<br />
      Forget the money for the telephone.  We've got a way to not pay.  <br />
 Sorry I haven't written. I've been learning a lot. I'm real good at <br />
 getting onto any computer in the country.  It's really easy!  I got into <br />
 the university's in less than fifteen minutes.  Frederick did it in five, <br />
 he's going to show me how.  Frederick is my bunk partner.  He's really <br />
 smart.  He says that I shouldn't call myself Billy anymore.  So, I'm not.<br />
                     Signed, William.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Dear Mother,<br />
      How nice of you to come up on Parents Day.  Why'd you get so upset? <br />
 I haven't gained that much weight.  The glasses aren't real.  Everybody <br />
 wears them. I was trying to fit in.  Believe me, the tape on them is <br />
 cool.  I thought that you'd be proud of my program. After all, I've made <br />
 some money on it.  A publisher is sending a check for $30,000. Anyway, <br />
 I've paid for the next six weeks of camp.  I won't be home until late <br />
 August.<br />
                     Regards, William.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Mother,<br />
      Stop treating me like a child.  True -- physically I am only ten <br />
 years old. It was silly of you to try to kidnap me.  Do not try again. <br />
 Remember, I can make your life miserable (i.e. - the bank, credit bureau, <br />
 and government computers). I am not kidding.  O.K.?  I won't write again <br />
 and this is your only warning. The emotions of this interpersonal <br />
 communication drain me.<br />
                     Sincerely, William.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
      See what I mean? It's been two weeks since I've heard from my little<br />
 boy. What can I do, Mr.Dvorak?  I know that it's probably too late to <br />
 save my little Billy.  But, if by printing these letters you can save <br />
 JUST ONE CHILD from a life of programming, please, I beg of you to do so.  <br />
 Thank you very much.<br />
 <br />
            Sally Gates, Concerned Parent<br />

   </div><div>You know you are an e-mail addict when...  <br />
<br />
   <br />
<br />
<br />
1) You wake up at 2 a.m. to go to the bathroom and stop to check your e-mail on the way back to bed. <br />
<br />

<br />
3) You name your children Eudora, Mozillia and Dotcom. <br />
<br />
4) You turn off your modem and get this awful empty feeling, like you just pulled the plug on a loved one. <br />
<br />
5) You spend half the plane trip with your laptop on your lap and your child in the overhead compartment. <br />
<br />
6) You decide to stay in college for an additional year or two, just for the free Internet access. <br />

<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
8) You start using smilies in snail mail. <br />
<br />
9) Your hard drive crashes. You haven't logged in for two hours. You start to twitch. You pick up the phone and manually dial your ISP's access number. You try to hum to communicate with the modem .... and you succeed. <br />
<br />
10) You find yourself typing "com" after every period when using a word processor.com <br />
<br />
11) You refer to going to the bathroom as "downloading." <br />
<br />

<br />

   </div><div><br />
Engineering is so trendy these days that everybody wants to<br />
be one.  The word "engineer" is greatly overused.  If there's<br />
somebody in your life who you think is trying to pass as an<br />
engineer, give him this test to discern the truth.<br />
<br />
Engineer Identification Test<br />
<br />
You walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging<br />
crooked.  You...<br />
<br />
A. Straighten it.<br />
B. Ignore it.<br />
C. Buy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a solar-powered, self-adjusting picture frame while often stating aloud your belief that the inventor of the nail was a total moron.<br />
<br />
The correct answer is "C" but partial credit can be given to<br />
anybody who writes "It depends" in the margin of the test or<br />
simply blames the whole stupid thing on "Marketing."<br />
<br />
Social Skills<br />
<br />
Engineers have different objectives when it comes to social<br />
interaction.<br />
<br />
"Normal" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic<br />
things from social interaction:<br />
<br />
<br />
  Stimulating and thought-provoking conversation<br />
  Important social contacts<br />
  A feeling of connectedness with other humans<br />
<br />
<br />
In contrast to "normal" people, engineers have rational<br />
objectives for social interactions:<br />
<br />
<br />
  Get it over with as soon as possible.<br />
  Avoid getting invited to something unpleasant.<br />
  Demonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fascination with Gadgets<br />
<br />
To the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed<br />
into one of two categories:<br />
<br />
<br />
  Things that need to be fixed, and<br />
  Things that will need to be fixed after you've had a few minutes to play with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Engineers like to solve problems.  If there are no problems<br />
handily available, they will create their own problems.<br />
Normal people don't understand this concept; they believe<br />
that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Engineers believe that<br />
if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet.<br />
<br />
No engineer looks at a television remote control without<br />
wondering what it would take to turn it into a stun gun.  No<br />
engineer can take a shower without wondering if some sort of<br />
Teflon coating would make showering unnecessary.  To the<br />
engineer, the world is a toy box full of sub-optimized and<br />
feature-poor toys.<br />
<br />
Fashion and Appearance<br />
<br />
Clothes are the lowest priority for an engineer, assuming<br />
the basic thresholds for temperature and decency have been<br />
satisfied.  If no appendages are freezing or sticking together,<br />
and if no genitalia or mammary glands are swinging around in<br />
plain view, then the objective of clothing has been met.<br />
Anything else is a waste.<br />
<br />
Dating and Social Life<br />
<br />
Dating is never easy for engineers.  A normal person will<br />
employ various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a<br />
false impression of attractiveness. Engineers are incapable<br />
of placing appearance above function.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole.  They are<br />
widely recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent,<br />
dependable, employed, honest, and handy around the house.<br />
While it's true that many normal people would prefer not to<br />
date an engineer, most normal people harbor an intense desire<br />
to mate with them, thus producing engineerlike children who<br />
will have high-paying jobs long before losing their virginity.<br />
<br />
Male engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness<br />
later than normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos<br />
in their mid thirties to late forties. Just look at these<br />
examples of sexually irresistible men in technical<br />
professions:<br />
<br />
<br />
  Bill Gates.<br />
  MacGyver.<br />
  Etcetera.<br />
<br />
<br />
Female engineers become irresistible at the age of consent<br />
and remain that way until about thirty minutes after their<br />
clinical death.  Longer if it's a warm day.<br />
<br />
Honesty<br />
<br />
Engineers are always honest in matters of technology and<br />
human relationships.  That's why it's a good idea to keep<br />
engineers away from customers, romantic interests, and other<br />
people who can't handle the truth.<br />
<br />
Engineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work.  They say<br />
things that sound like lies but technically are not because<br />
nobody could be expected to believe them. The complete list<br />
of engineer lies is listed below.<br />
<br />
<br />
  "I won't change anything without asking you first."<br />
  "I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow."<br />
  "I have to have new equipment to do my job."<br />
  "I'm not jealous of your new computer."<br />
<br />
<br />
Frugality<br />
<br />
Engineers are notoriously frugal.  This is not because of<br />
cheapness or mean spirit; it is simply because every spending<br />
situation is simply a problem in optimization, that is, "How<br />
can I escape this situation while retaining the greatest<br />
amount of cash?"<br />
<br />
Powers of Concentration<br />
<br />
If there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is<br />
the ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete<br />
exclusion of everything else in the environment.  This<br />
sometimes causes engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely.<br />
Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have started checking<br />
resumes before processing the bodies.  Anybody with a degree<br />
in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming<br />
is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he<br />
or she snaps out of it.<br />
<br />
Risk<br />
<br />
Engineers hate risk.  They try to eliminate it whenever they<br />
can.  This is understandable, given that when an engineer<br />
makes one little mistake the media will treat it like it's a<br />
big deal or something.<br />
<br />
Examples of Bad Press for Engineers<br />
<br />
<br />
  Hindenberg.<br />
  Space Shuttle Challenger.<br />
  SPANet(tm)<br />
  Hubble space telescope.<br />
  Apollo 13.<br />
  Titanic.<br />
  Ford Pinto.<br />
  Corvair.<br />
<br />
<br />
The risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something<br />
like this:<br />
<br />
RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people.<br />
REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.<br />
<br />
Being practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of<br />
risks and rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing.<br />
The best way to avoid risk is by advising that any activity<br />
is technically impossible for reasons that are far too<br />
complicated to explain.<br />
<br />
If that approach is not sufficient to halt the project, then<br />
the engineer will fall back to a second line of defense:<br />
"It's technically possible but it will cost too much."<br />
<br />
Ego<br />
<br />
Ego-wise, two things are important to engineers:<br />
<br />
  How smart they are.<br />
  How many cool devices they own.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to<br />
declare that the problem is unsolvable.  No engineer can walk<br />
away from an unsolvable problem until it's solved.  No illness<br />
or distraction is sufficient to get the engineer off the case.<br />
These types of challenges quickly become personal -- a battle<br />
between the engineer and the laws of nature.<br />
<br />
Engineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve<br />
a problem.  (Other times just because they forgot.)  And when<br />
they succeed in solving the problem they will experience an<br />
ego rush that is better than sex -- and I'm including the<br />
kind of sex where other people are involved.<br />
<br />
Nothing is more threatening to the engineer than the<br />
suggestion that somebody has more technical skill.  Normal<br />
people sometimes use that knowledge as a lever to extract<br />
more work from the engineer.  When an engineer says that<br />
something can't be done (a code phrase that means it's not<br />
fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance<br />
at the engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say<br />
something along these lines:  "I'll ask Bob to figure it out.<br />
He knows how to solve difficult technical problems."<br />
<br />
At that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not<br />
stand between the engineer and the problem.  The engineer<br />
will set upon the problem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork<br />
chop.<br />
<br />
<br />

   </div><div>The Evil Side of Television<br />
by Joe Lavin<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the story of my nineteen inch television and how I tried to<br />
ship it from California to Massachusetts. Brace yourself. It is not a<br />
happy story. I tell this story so that others may learn from my<br />
mistake. Never -- I repeat -- never try to ship a nineteen inch<br />
television. <br />
<br />
Problem #1 -- I wake up that day and realize I need a box. That's no<br />
problem at all, I think. I head to the Box Depot, a store that<br />
features not only many boxes but also a rodent-like dog who insists on<br />
attacking my friend repeatedly. Suffice it to say that their slogan<br />
seems to be, "Sparky!!!! No bite!" I eventually get a twenty-four inch<br />
cube. My friend eventually gets out alive. I also buy packing supplies<br />
-- $9 worth of little white peanuts or, as they soon will be called,<br />
little white minions of Satan. <br />
<br />
Problem #2 -- At first, it looks like there won't be a second problem<br />
and that everyone in the world will live happily ever after.  I put<br />
the television in the box, drop in hundreds of the little minions,<br />
seal it up, and bring it to my car. All runs smoothly until . . .  <br />
<br />
Well, the box doesn't fit in the car. I understand that it doesn't fit<br />
in the trunk. As I look at the trunk, I realize I could never get away<br />
with murder because I wouldn't be able to fit the body in the trunk.<br />
Practically nothing fits in the trunk, but somehow I just can't<br />
believe that the box won't fit in the back seat. I realize that my<br />
unscientific measurement of the car door earlier in the day really<br />
should have been far more scientific. <br />
   <br />
Problem #3 -- I call a few shipping companies to see if they'll pick<br />
it up. However, the shipping fees they want to charge are slightly<br />
more than the value of the television, which is several years old and<br />
often has to be unplugged to be turned off.  <br />
<br />
Luckily, without the box, the television will fit in the back seat.<br />
Our new plan is to pack it outside the UPS building. We remove the<br />
television from the box and put it in the back seat, which of course<br />
causes millions of the little white minions of Satan to go flying onto<br />
the ground. It takes about fifteen miserable minutes to pick up the $9<br />
of white things. Eventually, we collect them all, fold up the box,<br />
throw it in with the television, and are on the road ready for . . . <br />
<br />
Problem #4 -- UPS is in the ghetto. Well, not exactly. There are worse<br />
sections of Los Angeles, but there are so many more that are nicer. My<br />
computer is also in the car, and I grit my teeth as I drive my most<br />
valuable possessions through this neighborhood. Red lights last for<br />
eternity. <br />
<br />
Problem #5 -- Can you believe it? I am running out of the god damn<br />
white things. Initially, I had more than I could comprehend, but<br />
somehow many have escaped through the time-space continuum into a<br />
parallel white things universe. After we pack the television in the<br />
parking lot, there is now a gaping space at the top of the box. <br />
<br />
UPS closes in a few minutes, and I have to leave the next day. I must<br />
do something. I search frantically through my car for stuff to put in<br />
the box so that the television won't rattle. I find some towels. I<br />
find a plastic container of water. I empty what's left of the<br />
container and throw it in the box along with the towels. I feel like a<br />
damn fool, but the box really doesn't look that bad. At least, that's<br />
what I keep telling myself. It almost looks like everything might work<br />
out until of course I come across . . . <br />
<br />
Problem #6 -- UPS Guy: "I see this isn't the original box."<br />
<br />
Me: "Um."<br />
<br />
UPS Guy: "I have to open it."<br />
<br />
Me: "No!!!"<br />
<br />
UPS Guy: "What?"<br />
<br />
Me: "I mean, you don't really need to do that. I mean, it's fine the<br />
way it is. Um, right?"<br />
<br />
UPS Guy: "I'm sorry. I have to see if it's packed properly."<br />
<br />
Me: "No, please!"<br />
<br />
That, of course, is the end. The first thing he sees is the empty<br />
water container. A few drops of water drip out as he picks it up. <br />
<br />
"It has to be in its original box or packed professionally." He says.<br />
<br />
"But it's --" Well, it hasn't been packed professionally, and I know<br />
it. Frankly, being called a mere amateur in the field of packing<br />
stings. I explain how I had been told by UPS that I didn't need the<br />
original box,  but he doesn't care. He just shrugs and tells me that<br />
he can't take the box. <br />
<br />
It would be one thing if I could blame him for being rude or nasty,<br />
but I can't. He is perfectly nice and listens patiently as I vent my<br />
anger. He nods frequently and even apologizes occasionally. He seems<br />
to be a wonderful person. I hate him. I am not thinking rationally.<br />
Just to be a pain in the ass, I insist that he seal the box up again.<br />
I return to my car and of course . . . <br />
<br />
Problem #7 -- Well, the box still doesn't fit in my car. So there I am<br />
with my wonderfully patient friend in this dark, lousy neighborhood,<br />
looking at a giant box that won't fit in my car. That's when I decide<br />
just to leave the stupid television in the parking lot and drive away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that would be the perfect ending, but I don't have quite enough<br />
guts to do that. Instead, we unseal the box, take the television out,<br />
and put it in the back seat. And of course, the white minions of Satan<br />
go flying all over the UPS parking lot. Somehow, all the ones I lost<br />
before mysteriously reappear. A few hundred more from that parallel<br />
universe seem to have joined them. I'd like to leave them there, but a<br />
security guard is giving me a dirty look. And so we spend the next ten<br />
minutes again picking up white things off the ground and throwing them<br />
into my trunk. <br />
<br />
There is a happy ending, sort of. The television eventually made it to<br />
Massachusetts. On my drive across country, I put it in the back seat<br />
and drove it through San Francisco, Las Vegas, Denver, Kansas City,<br />
St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus, Harrisburg, and into New England. <br />
<br />
Here's the strange part. Remember how I said the television wouldn't<br />
always turn off. Well, now that it's been loaded in and out of my car<br />
dozens of times, carried up the steps of several hotels, driven across<br />
the bumps of fourteen states, and cursed at more times than I can<br />
remember, it no longer has this problem. Yes, now that I hate my<br />
television and never want to see it ever again, it works just<br />
perfectly. <br />
<br />
Go figure. <br />

   </div><div>Evolution of Product Documentation<br />
<br />
<br />
Most documentation starts as hastily scrawled notes from<br />
sleep-deprived developers who weren't necessarily hired for their<br />
keen communication skills. Those notes are then fleshed out by<br />
recently graduated English majors who have spent their last four<br />
years immersed in works of fiction.  The results are then passed on<br />
to the marketing department whose job it is to make sure that no word<br />
or phrase will reflect unfavorably on the product ("I don't think<br />
that the word 'Basic' properly communicates the exciting nature of<br />
the product. Why don't we call it 'Visual Zesty?!'").  It is then<br />
beset by lawyers who finish the job by making sure that they haven't<br />
explicitly promised that the product will actually do anything.  By<br />
the time the documentation gets into your hands, it has been so<br />
sanitized for your protection and generalized beyond recognition that<br />
you usually have to go out and buy a 3rd-party manual (that was, more<br />
likely than not, written by the same non-technical technical writer<br />
who wrote the original documentation) in a vain attempt to get an<br />
unbiased, unexpurgated, and unfiltered view of just how you're really<br />
supposed to use the stuff.<br />

<br />
<br />
	A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer.<br />
	The tech asked her if she was "running it under Windows." The woman then <br />
  	responded, "No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good point.<br />
 	The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window, and his is <br />
  	working fine."<br />
      <br />
      <br />
 	 Tech Support: "OK Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at the<br />
 	same time. That brings up a task list in the middle of the screen.  Now<br />
  	type the letter 'P' to bring up the Program Manager." <br />
  	Customer: "I don't have a 'P'."<br />
  	Tech Support: "On your keyboard, Bob." <br />
  	Customer: "What do you mean?"<br />
  	Tech Support: "'P' on your keyboard, Bob." <br />

   </div><div>Flame Response Form<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are part of any public listervs - which are public discussion <br />
group - you are all too aware of the craziness of being part of <br />
such as group: Threads (Continuing Discussions) which last a lifetime,<br />
insanely boorish comments and the all too common trite replies<br />
"I agree"<br />
<br />
Well there is now a standard reply form for FLAMING<br />
(listed under the government e-mail paperwork reduction act)<br />
For those unfamiliar with the term, flaming is the immediate<br />
and often irrational response to emails that annoy you.<br />
They can be sent to individual on public listervs - <br />
where people mouth off their opinions.<br />
<br />
PS. If you are new to the web, read carefully to avoid <br />
being flamed yourself.<br />
<br />
This is a bit long, but you have all weekend<br />

   </div><div>Gates Give Coke Some Pointers<br />
<br />
<br />
Bill Gates recently compared the OS market with the soft drink market, <br />
explaining that Microsoft is hanging on for dear life in the <br />
ultracompetitive OS market while Coke enjoys a real monopoly, <br />
since they'll be on top forever, but the DOJ doesn't pick on them. <br />
Of course, Bill should be careful not to give Coke any ideas. We <br />
might end up with a scenario like the following:<br />
<br />
  Joe: (walking into McDonalds) Hi, i'd like a Big Mac.<br />
<br />
  Cashier: Okay, here's your Big Mac and here's your Coke.   <br />
	That'll be $3.99.<br />
<br />
  J: Uh, i don't want a Coke.<br />
<br />
  C: Sorry, they're bundled.<br />
<br />
  J: What? I'm not paying for a Coke!<br />
<br />
  C: You don't; the Coke is free.<br />
<br />
  J: But wasn't a Big Mac $2.49 last week?<br />
<br />
  C: Sure, but this latest Big Mac is far more innovative. It's<br />
     got integrated Coke!<br />
<br />
  J: I already bought a 7-Up across the street - I'm not going <br />
	to drink the Coke.<br />
<br />
  C: Then you can't have the burger.<br />
<br />
  J:  Okay, fine, i'll pay the $3.99 and throw the Coke away.<br />
<br />
  C: Oh, you can't do that. They're seamlessly integrated. Totally<br />
     inseparable.<br />
<br />
  J: How can that be? They're two totally seperate things!<br />
<br />
  C: No, watch. (takes Big Mac, dunks it in a tank of Coke) See?<br />
<br />
  J: Why did you just do that?!?!<br />
<br />
  C: It's a benefit to the consumer. Otherwise you'd end up with<br />
     	two different, inconsistent tastes. This way you're assured <br />
	of a continuous taste across all your foods.<br />
<br />
  J: Aaarrgh!<br />

   </div><div>Dear Tech Support:<br />
<br />
Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began expected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources.<br />
<br />
In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3,<br />
<br />
Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 no longer run,crashing the system whenever selected.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favourite applications.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
A Troubled User.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
REPLY:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Dear Troubled User:<br />
<br />
This is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!!<br />
<br />
It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed not to allow this.<br />
<br />
Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony/Child Support." I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation.<br />
<br />
I suggest installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software augmentation.<br />
<br />
The best course of action is to enter the command C: \ APOLOGIZE. Because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway.<br />
<br />
Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife<br />
<br />
1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2. However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds5.0!<br />
<br />
WARNING!!!<br />
<br />
O NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
<br />
Tech Support<br />

   </div><div>GirlGriend Version 1.0<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	 I'm currently running the latest version of GirlFriend and I've been<br />
	 having some problems lately.  I've been running the same version of<br />
	 DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever as my primary application, and all the<br />
	 GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.<br />
 <br />
	 I hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in<br />
	 background mode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to<br />
	 say I can't find the switch to turn the sound off. I just run them<br />
	 separately, and it works okay.<br />
 <br />
	 GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf<br />
	 program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing<br />
	 incompatibility.<br />
 <br />
	 I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I<br />
	 might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of<br />
	 conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had<br />
	 experience with GirlFriend 2.0.  He said I probably didn't have<br />
	 enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would require<br />
	 a Token Ring to run properly.  He was right--as soon as I purged my<br />
	 cache, it uninstalled itself.<br />
 <br />
	 Shortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs<br />
	 were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me<br />
	 a virus anyway.  I had to clean out my whole system and shut down<br />
	 for a while.<br />
 <br />
	 I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0.  This time I used a<br />
	 SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection program. It<br />
	 worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was<br />
	 still in my system.  I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with<br />
	 GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I<br />
	 didn't know about that automatically senses the presence of any<br />
	 other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in some<br />
	 way, which results in the immediate removal of both versions.<br />
	 <br />
	 The version I have now works pretty well, but there are still some<br />
	 problems.  Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some<br />
	 obscure language I can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly I<br />
	 think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather<br />
	 than the desired functionality.  Also, to get the best connections<br />
	 with your hardware, you usually have to use gold-plated contacts.<br />
	 And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally "object-oriented."<br />
	 <br />
	 A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to<br />
	 GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version<br />
	 of GirlFriend.  He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires<br />
	 within a year if you don't upgrade to Fiancee 1.0.  So he did, but<br />
	 soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes<br />
	 as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space, so he can't<br />
	 load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go<br />
	 with Wife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus.<br />
	 <br />
	 Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0<br />
	 sometimes prohibits access to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new<br />
	 Plug-Ins he wanted to try.  On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be<br />
	 running on a well warmed-up system before he can do anything.<br />
	 Although he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw 1.0<br />
	 which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn-off.<br />
	 <br />
	 I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he heard if<br />
	 you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0<br />
	 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself. Then<br />
	 Mistress 1.0 won't install anyway because of insufficient resources.<br />
 <br />
	 I suppose the moral of the story is: know your system's hardware,<br />
	 it's software requirements and compatibilities and be real careful<br />
	 about what software you install and when and how you upgrade.<br />
 <br />

   </div><div>Hitching on the Information Highway<br />
by Kal Rosenberg<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After Mom passed away we carried home her big TV -- her first and only<br />
color set.  We had bought it for her birthday twelve years before.  It<br />
was bigger than the one in our bedroom so we put hers there instead.  It<br />
had no remote control, so I asked Sandi to please pick up a zapper first<br />
chance she got.  She did.<br />
<br />
The DeLuxe Universal Remote lay inside an impressive bubble pack.  It<br />
claimed the ability to remotatize any TV set in this and nearby<br />
galaxies.  It came with a nice little instruction book.  The nice little<br />
instruction book had forty-eight pages.  On page three it proclaimed<br />
that anyone over the age of six could easily program the zapper.<br />
<br />
Still, I knew we belonged to the electronically challenged generation.<br />
Despite a solid liberal arts education, we had been unable to play<br />
recorded music since our eight track went.  But now the Universal Remote<br />
Company was making us a promise.  It was my big chance, especially since<br />
I felt I knew more than most six-year olds.  This new link in my golden<br />
chain might at last connect us with the twentieth century before it<br />
ended.  I fantasized operating CD players -- whatever they are -- and<br />
pre-setting our VCR (which would no longer mock us with insatiable 12:00<br />
... 12:00 ... 12:00 ...).  I might even glide across a suddenly<br />
comprehensible Internet!  We could leave our horse-and-buggy days<br />
behind, appliancewise.  A powerful mantra from the DeLuxe Universal<br />
Remote zapper would empower us, placing us at last in harmony with the<br />
strange and distant electronic universe in which we now floundered.<br />
<br />
I read each of the forty-eight pages in the nice manual.  (Six-year olds<br />
must be much smarter than in my day!)  I scrupulously switched, set,<br />
held, waited and pushed.  All was in place.  I hit the final button.<br />
Nothing.  I was dumber than a six-year old.  Dumber than his shoes.  I<br />
was Neolithic.  Obsolete.  A fossil.  Frozen in an ice block of time --<br />
like a lump of pineapple in a Jell-O mold -- somewhere between pin boys<br />
and the Shirelles.  It seemed that God was not about to let us cross<br />
over into the land of cyber-milk and virtual honey, even after aimless<br />
wanderings in the vast Computer Desert, lo these many years.<br />
<br />
As I put the remote back in its bubble pack I thought about making an<br />
excuse for when I returned it.  I would say it was not my size.  As I<br />
turned the package over to re-staple it, there in bold red print was<br />
what seemed to be my last chance to ride on the Information Highway:  IF<br />
YOU FOLLOWED ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND THIS UNIT FAILS TO OPERATE YOUR<br />
ELECTRONIC APPLIANCE, CALL THE 800 NUMBER BELOW.  DOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACK<br />
IF OUR UNIVERSAL REMOTE FAILS TO PERFORM!!!<br />
<br />
Another promise.  With three exclamation points.<br />
<br />
I must have done something wrong, and some kindly phone voice,<br />
accustomed to assisting primitives, would gently lift me higher, higher,<br />
until we dazzled with zapper-competence.  I phoned the 800 number.<br />
<br />
"Universal Remote customer service.  This is Jeffrey.  How can I help<br />
you?"<br />
<br />
"Jeffrey, I have your remote.  I can't get it to work."<br />
<br />
"Which model please?"<br />
<br />
"It's the DeLuxe."<br />
<br />
He seemed annoyed.  "They're all DeLuxe, sir!  Is it the DeLuxe<br />
Universal Remote One or the DeLuxe Universal remote Two?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know.  How do you tell?"<br />
<br />
There was an exasperated pause.  "The 'One' has a big 'One' on the<br />
front, sir."  Another pause.  "The 'Two' ... "<br />
<br />
" ... has a 'Two.'  Okay Jeffrey, it's a Two.  I'm with you so far."<br />
<br />
"Okay then.  What brand is your set?"<br />
<br />
"Zenith."<br />
<br />
"Super.  How old?"<br />
<br />
"Twelve years."<br />
<br />
"That works for me.  Now, how about all the steps on page sixteen?  You<br />
do 'em?"<br />
<br />
"Yes."<br />
<br />
"How about the trouble-shooting section, pages forty-four through<br />
forty-seven?"<br />
<br />
"That too."<br />
<br />
"Not to worry.  I'll walk you through it.  First, get the original<br />
remote and turn it over."<br />
<br />
"Original remote?"<br />
<br />
"Yeah.  The one that came with the set."<br />
<br />
"Jeffrey, if I had an original remote why would I buy yours?"<br />
<br />
"Whaddaya mean?"<br />
<br />
"What I mean is, Jeffrey, for one TV I only need one remote.  Why would<br />
I have two?  If I had the original, I wouldn't have had to buy one."<br />
<br />
"So, you don't have the original then."<br />
<br />
"What original?"<br />
<br />
"Wait a minute.  Do you mean to tell me your set never had a remote?"<br />
<br />
"I do."<br />
<br />
"Well," he laughed, "that's bad, because this one won't work."<br />
<br />
"Oh, but that's good, Jeffrey.  You can just send me double my money<br />
back."<br />
<br />
"We can't do that."<br />
<br />
"It says so right here on the package."<br />
<br />
"Yeah, but if your set never came with a remote then no remote will work<br />
'cause you don't have a sensor."<br />
<br />
"There's no mention of 'sensor' in the nice instructions.  If we needed<br />
one of those things, somewhere in here is should have told us that and<br />
we would have bought one."<br />
<br />
Another one of those pauses.  "Sir," he said softly, as if speaking to a<br />
child, "let's say you have this car, and you want to take a ride.  Now,<br />
you have the key, but there's no engine.  So, you open the door, you get<br />
in, you turn the key.  Now, what do you think happens?"<br />
<br />
"I think I get double my money back for that car!"<br />
<br />
"Sir!  Everyone knows you need a sensor in your TV for a remote to<br />
work.  What you are saying is ridiculous.  Either this is some kind of a<br />
joke -- which I really don't appreciate -- or you've been asleep for<br />
twenty years."  Then his tone suddenly changed.  "I don't mean to be<br />
abrupt or rude, sir.  And please excuse me for asking, but are you all<br />
right?  Is there someone there with you I can talk to?  Someone who<br />
takes care of you?  Do you know your phone number?  I'll have a<br />
supervisor call you right back.  Maybe we'll send you double your money<br />
back.  Would you like that!  Hello?  Sir?  Hello?"<br />
<br />
I hung up.  It was like I was struck down by a modem (which until<br />
recently I thought was a feminine hygiene product).  This young boy --<br />
what could he possibly know of life -- who had just spoken to me as if I<br />
were a six-year old (and not a bright one), became seriously concerned<br />
because I was out of touch with his reality.  And so I was.<br />
<br />
I still would like to surf the Web, watching megs and gigawhatsis scoot<br />
around us.  Patiently we will wait for our high-tech Fairy Godmother,<br />
our booted up Robin Hood.  But slowly I'm learning.  A little here.  A<br />
little there.  You know what those computerniks say:  "Hit any user to<br />
continue."<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/How_Company_Names_Came_About.html">How Company Names Came About</a></h2>
   </div><div>Do You Know ...How These Names Came About?!?!? <br />
 <br />
Adobe - came from name of the river Adobe Creek that ran behind the <br />
house of founder John Warnock. <br />
 <br />
Apache - It got its name because its founders got started by applying <br />
patches to code written for NCSA's httpd daemon. The result was 'A PAtCHy' <br />
server -- thus, the name Apache <br />
 <br />
Apple Computers - favourite fruit of founder Steve Jobs. He was three <br />
months late in filing a name for the business, and he threatened to call <br />
his company Apple Computers if the other colleagues didn't suggest a <br />
better name by 5 o'clock. <br />
 <br />
CISCO - its not an acronymn but the short for San Francisco. <br />
 <br />
Google - the name started as a jokey boast about the amount of <br />
information the search-engine would be able to search. It was originally <br />
named 'Googol', a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 <br />
zeros. After founders - Stanford grad students Sergey Brin and Larry <br />
Page resented their project to an angel investor, they received a <br />
cheque made out to 'Google' <br />
 <br />
Hotmail - Founder Jack Smith got the idea of accessing e-mail via the <br />
web from a computer anywhere in the world. When Sabeer Bhatia came up <br />
with the business plan for the mail service, he tried all kinds of <br />
names ending in 'mail' and finally settled for hotmail as it included <br />
the letters "html" - the programming language used to write web pages. <br />
It was initially referred to as HoTMaiL with selective upper casing. <br />
 <br />
HP - Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tossed a coin to decide whether the <br />
company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard or <br />
Packard-Hewlett. <br />
 <br />
Intel - Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore wanted to name their new company <br />
'Moore Noyce' but that was already trademarked by a hotel chain, so they <br />
had to settle for an acronym of INTegrated ELectronics. <br />
 <br />
Lotus (Notes) - Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from 'The <br />
Lotus Position' or 'Padmasana'. Kapor used to be a teacher of <br />
Transcendental Meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. <br />
 <br />
Microsoft - coined by Bill Gates to represent the company that was <br />
devoted to MICROcomputer SOFTware. Originally christened Micro-Soft, <br />
the '-' was removed later on. <br />
 <br />
Motorola - Founder Paul Galvin came up with this name when his company <br />
started manufacturing radios for cars. The popular radio company at the <br />
time was called Victrola. <br />
 <br />
ORACLE - Larry Ellison and Bob Oats were working on a consulting <br />
project for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). The code name for the <br />
project was called Oracle(the CIA saw this as the system to give answers <br />
to all questions or something such). <br />
Acronym for: One Real Asshole Called Larry Ellison ?? <br />
 <br />
Red Hat - Company founder Marc Ewing was given the Cornell lacrosse <br />
team cap (with red and white stripes) while at college by his <br />
grandfather. He lost it and had to search for it desperately. The <br />
manual of the beta version of Red Hat Linux had an appeal to readers <br />
to return his Red Hat if found by anyone ! <br />
 <br />
SAP - "Systems, Applications, Products in Data Processing", formed by 4 <br />
ex-IBM employees who used to work in the <br />
'Systems/Applications/Projects' group of IBM. <br />
 <br />
Sony - from the Latin word 'sonus' meaning sound, and 'sonny' a slang <br />
used by Americans to refer to a bright youngster. <br />
 <br />
SUN - founded by 4 Stanford University buddies, SUN is the acronym <br />
for Stanford University Network. <br />
 <br />
Xerox - The inventor, Chestor Carlson, named his product trying to say <br />
dry' (as it was dry copying, markedly different from the then <br />
prevailing <br />
wet copying). The Greek root `xer' means dry. <br />
 <br />
Yahoo! - the word was invented by Jonathan Swift and used in his book <br />
'Gulliver's Travels'. It represents a person who is repulsive in <br />
appearance and action and is barely human. Yahoo! founders Jerry Yang <br />
and David Filo selected the name because they considered <br />
themselves yahoos. <br />

The little boy asks his father, "Daddy, how was I born?"<br />
<br />
Dad responds, "Ah, my son, I guess one day you will need to find out anyway. Well, you see, your Mom and I first got together in a chat room on AOL. Then I set up a date via e-mail with your Mom and we met at a cyber-cafe. We sneaked into a secluded room, where your mother agreed to a download from my hard drive. As soon as I was ready to upload, we discovered that neither one of us had used a firewall, and since it was too late to hit the delete button.  Nine months<br />
later a blessed little Popup appeared and said, "You've got male!"<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/How_it_all_Began.html">How It All Began</a></h2>
   </div><div><br />
In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham <br />
Com <br />
did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was <br />
a <br />
comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been <br />
called <br />
Amazon Dot Com.<br />
<br />
She said unto Abraham, her husband, "Why doth thou travel far from town <br />
to <br />
town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?" <br />
And <br />
Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of <br />
a <br />
camel load, but simply said, "How, Dear?" And Dot replied, "I will <br />
place <br />
drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying <br />
what you <br />
have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best <br />
price. And <br />
the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony <br />
Stable <br />
(UPS)."<br />
<br />
Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the <br />
drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold <br />
all <br />
the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. <br />
But <br />
this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secret himself <br />
inside <br />
Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man <br />
did <br />
take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel <br />
dung. <br />
They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or <br />
NERDS <br />
for short. And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches <br />
and <br />
the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches <br />
were <br />
going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up <br />
every <br />
drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that <br />
would <br />
work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks.<br />
<br />
Dot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by <br />
others." And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it <br />
came to <br />
be known "eBay" he said, "we need a name that reflects what we are," <br />
and Dot <br />
replied, "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators." "YAHOO", said <br />
Abraham. <br />
And that is how it all began, It wasn't Al Gore after all.<br />

   </div>
   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/How_to_Pick_Up_Girls_on_Orkut.html">How To Pick Up Girls On Orkut</a></h2>
   </div><div>There are several ways you could approach this situation. You could talk to girls in real life, but that is slow and difficult. Because communicating via network is more powerful than communicating via broadcast, we would be losing out on the network effect if we were to approach girls manually. Approaching girls at parties and bars is like Pussy 1.0. I'm here today to introduce you to an entirely new concept, one that I like to call Pussy 2.0. By using Orkut, we can greatly amplify our ability to pick up bitches. Think of it like turning a pussy magnet into a pussy electro-magnet.<br />
<br />
<b>Setting the Scene</b><br />
<br />
The first step is making yourself look cool. In general, you want to project an image that combines manliness and wealth. No balls, no blue chips. No blue chips, blue balls.<br />
<br />
Now that you know the strategy, let's look at the tactics:<br />
<br />
   1. Get as many friends as possible. If you don't have at least 100 friends, you should probably kill yourself.<br />
   2. Write on lots of people's walls. Then they'll be obligated to write back on your wall, and you'll look really cool.<br />
   3. Make sure you're profile picture has alcohol in it. This will make it look like you have lots of friends and get invited to all the cool parties.<br />
   4. Under interests, list things like your favorite clothing brand and where you last went on vacation. This will subtly hint that you have lots of money in a tasteful way.<br />
   5. Say that you're married to another guy. Everyone will think this is really funny. Trust me.<br />
   6. If all your music tastes are really obscure, add at least one trashy pop album. This will make you look like a man of the people. Alternatively, if all your music is generic rock, add at least one album that no one has ever heard of. This will make you look classy.<br />
   7. Join lots of political groups about things like ending discrimination and saving Darfur. This absolves you from real world responsibilities like helping others and voting. If Martin Luther King Jr. were still alive today, this is exactly what he'd be doing.<br />
<br />
Remember, success comes first in the mind, then in your pants, never the other way around.<br />
<br />
<b>The Initial Contact</b><br />
<br />
The next step is to actually approach the women. Here are some general principles for success:<br />
<br />
   1. Poke lots of random girls. If you do this enough, one of them will definitely have sex with you.<br />
   2. Choose girls with no pictures. If the girl has no picture, there's probably a reason. If you want to seal the deal, then deal with the seal. Ask girls out on their wall instead of through private messages. If you can't charm them into saying yes, then publicly embarrass them into not saying no.<br />
   3. Once you ask her out and she says yes, don't sign onto AIM or answer your phone until your date. This will make it harder for her to change her mind.<br />
   4. Similarly to rule three, choose a date that's hard for her to get out of if she gets nervous. For a good first date, I'd suggest a plane ride to Thailand with a twelve year old bottle of wine.<br />
<br />
<b>Getting Her to Have Sex With You</b><br />
<br />
When trying to figure out whether or not a girl likes you, learn to recognize the holy trinity: She touches you, she lets you touch her, or she touches herself. While there's no way to know for sure whether a girl likes you short of hooking electrodes up to her genitals, these are some good signs. But what do you do if she doesn't seem to like you? The best answer is hypnosis. Here are some tips:<br />
<br />
   1. Try to penetrate your vocabulary with sexual words to get her subliminally turned on. Use phrases like, "The sky above us is so beautiful, but so is the ground blow me." This will make her want to have sex with you. It really works!!<br />
   2. Using leading phrases like, "Before we go back to my apartment, would you like another drink?" By hiding a statement inside a question, she is forced to do what you say, as if you had Jedi mind powers. This rare technique is impossible for her to resist.<br />
<br />
If you have followed all of the previously steps correctly, the girl should now be having sex with you. Congratulations!<br />

   scream, "Oh my God! They've found me!" and bolt.<br />
<br />
     Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes and then suddenly stop and<br />
   look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you.<br />
<br />
     When your computer is turned off, complain to the monitor on duty<br />
   that you can't get the darned thing to work. After he/she's turned it<br />
   on, wait 5 minutes, turn it off again, and repeat the process for a<br />
   good half hour.<br />
<br />
     Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next to you<br />
   evilly.<br />
<br />
     Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to a<br />
   different screen than the one it's set up with.<br />
<br />
     Write a program that plays the "Pokemon" theme song and play it at<br />
   the highest volume possible over and over again.<br />
<br />
     Work normally for a while. Suddenly look amazingly startled by<br />

   Pentagon files.<br />
<br />
     Use AIM to make passes at people you don't know.<br />
<br />
     Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you turn it on.<br />
<br />
     Bring a chainsaw, but don't use it. If anyone asks why you have it,<br />
   say, "Just in case..." mysteriously.<br />
<br />
     Type on VAX for awhile. Suddenly start cursing for 3 minutes about<br />
   everything bad about your life. Then stop and continue typing.<br />
<br />
     Enter the lab, undress, and start staring at other people as if<br />
   they're crazy while typing.<br />
<br />
     Light candles in a pentagram around your terminal before starting.<br />

<br />
     "Disk fight!"<br />
<br />
     Start making out with the person at the terminal next to you,<br />
   whether you know them or not.<br />

     Put a straw in your mouth and put your hands in your pockets. Type<br />

<br />
     If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing "The Thong<br />
   Song" whenever there is processing time required.<br />
<br />
     Draw a picture of a woman (or man) on a piece of paper and tape it<br />
   to your monitor. Try to seduce it. Act like it hates you and then<br />
   complain loudly that women (men) are worthless.<br />
<br />
     Try to stick a Nintendo cartridge in the disk drive. When it doesn't<br />
   work, get the supervisor.<br />
<br />
     When you start up a PC, ask loudly where the smiling Apple face is.<br />
<br />
     Print out the complete works of Shakespeare, then when it's all done<br />
   (two days later) say that all you wanted was a line or two.<br />
<br />
     Sit and stare at the screen, chomping on your nails. After doing<br />
   this for a while, spit them out at the feet of the person next to you.<br />
<br />
     Stare at the screen, grind your teeth, stop, look at the person next<br />
   to you. Repeat procedure, making sure you never provoke the person<br />
   enough to let them blow up, as this releases tension, and it is far<br />
   more effective to let them linger.<br />
<br />
     If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split ends, cut<br />
   them, and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard as you leave.<br />
<br />
     Put a large, gold-framed portrait of the British royal family on<br />
   your desk and loudly proclaim that it inspires you.<br />
<br />
     Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks. Remove shoes and<br />
   place them on top of the monitor. Remove socks layer by layer and<br />
   drape them around the monitor. Exclaim sudden haiku about the<br />
   aesthetic beauty of cotton on plastic.<br />
<br />
     Take the keyboard and sit under the computer. Type up your paper<br />
   like this. Then go to the lab supervisor and complain about the bad<br />
   working conditions.<br />
<br />
     Laugh hysterically, shout "You will all perish in a great flood" and<br />
   continue working.<br />
<br />
     Bring some dry ice and make it look like the computer is smoking.<br />
<br />
     Assign a musical note to every key (ex. the delete key is A flat).<br />
   Whenever you hit a key, hum its note loudly. Write an entire paper<br />
   this way.<br />
<br />
     Attempt to eat your computer mouse.<br />
<br />
     Borrow someone else's keyboard by reaching over, saying "Excuse me,<br />

   it.<br />
<br />
     Bring in a bunch of magnets and have a ball.<br />
<br />
     When doing calculations, pull out an abacus and say that sometimes<br />
   the old ways are best.<br />
<br />
     Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the lab.<br />
<br />
     Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over again until<br />
   you see that your neighbor is noticing. Then look at your neighbor's<br />
   keyboard. Hit his/her delete key several times, erasing an entire<br />
   word. While you do this, ask: "Does your delete key work?" Shake your<br />
   head, and resume hitting the space bar on your keyboard. Keep doing<br />
   this until you've deleted about a page of your neighbor's document.<br />
   Then, suddenly exclaim: "Well, whaddya know? I've been hitting the<br />
   space bar this whole time. No wonder it wasn't deleting! Ha!" Print<br />
   out your document and leave.<br />
<br />
     Remove your disk from the drive and hide it. Go to the lab monitor<br />
   and complain that your computer ate your disk. (For special effects,<br />
   put some glue on or around the disk drive. Claim that the computer is<br />
   drooling.)<br />
<br />
     Stare at your neighbor's screen, look really puzzled, burst out<br />
   laughing and say "You did that?" loudly. Keep laughing, grab your<br />
   stuff and leave, howling as you go.<br />
<br />
     Point at the screen. Chant in a made-up language while making<br />
   elaborate hand gestures for a minute or two. Press return or the<br />
   mouse, then leap back and yell, "COVEEEEERRRRR!" Peek up from under<br />
   the table, walk back to the computer and say "Oh, good. It worked this<br />
   time," and calmly start to type again.<br />
<br />
     Keep looking at invisible bugs and trying to swat them.<br />
<br />
     See who's online. Send a total stranger a talk request. Talk to them<br />
   like you've known them all your lives. Hang up before they get a<br />
   chance to figure out you're a total stranger.<br />
<br />
     Bring a small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound<br />
   effects. Pretend it's the computer and look really lost.<br />
<br />
     Pull out a pencil. Start writing on the screen. Complain that the<br />
   lead doesn't work.<br />
<br />
     Come into the computer lab wearing several extra-stinky species of<br />
   flowers in your hair. Smile incessantly. Type a sentence, then laugh<br />
   happily exclaim, "You're such a marvel!" and kiss the screen. Repeat<br />
   this after every sentence. As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the<br />
   keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, the computer assistant, and then<br />
   walk out.<br />
<br />
     Run into the computer lab, shout, "The Apocalypse is here!" then<br />
   calmly sit down and begin to type.<br />
<br />
     Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker chainsaw,<br />
   rev 'er up, and then walk up to the nearest person and say, "Give me<br />
   that computer or you'll be feeding my pet crocodile for the next<br />
   week."<br />
<br />
     Two words: Tesla Coil.<br />

   </div><div>A man loved a girl studies computer science/engineer.<br />
he sent a letter saying : <br />
<br />
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN MY COMPUTER<br />
Believe me it is true... <br />
<br />
You installed the best in me.<br />
Your picture is always in my background. <br />
You clicked my heart gently. <br />
You drive me crazy when I see you. <br />
Your love reset my life and deleted all the sadness in<br />
me. <br />
You restored my kindness after I thought it was<br />
corrupted. <br />
I'm always connected to you with more than 56 heart<br />
beat per second. <br />
You hacked my brain and registered your name in it.<br />
You are the only one that could navigate my feelings<br />
and explore my emotions at the same time. <br />
I feel lost when I try to call you and you are not<br />
responding. <br />
I always feel you close to me when I shut down my<br />
eyes, or when I open my windows waiting for you to<br />
pass. <br />
You are the only one that can log into my heart and<br />
never log out. <br />
I dream of being your only serveras long as I live. <br />
You don't have to search for me,cause we are always<br />
linked to<br />
each others.<br />
I see your name everywhere, my FrontPage, my homepage<br />
and all my software. <br />
I scanned my life and found that I'm only infected by<br />
you. <br />
You are the virus I'd never remove, and why should I<br />
do?. <br />
You formatted my life and added happiness to view.<br />
Believe me it is true...<br />
I love you more than my CPU.<br />

<br />
2. The AOL car would come equipped with a NEW and fantastic 8-Track tape<br />

<br />
3. The car would often refuse to start and owners would just expect this<br />
	and try again later.<br />
<br />
4. The windshield would have an extra dark tint to protect the driver from<br />
	seeing better cars.<br />
<br />
5. AOL would sell the same model car year after year and claim it?s the NEW<br />
	model.<br />
<br />
6. Every now and then the brakes on the AOL car would just "lock-up" for no<br />
	apparent reason.<br />
<br />
7. The AOL car would have a very plain body style but would have lots?a<br />
	pretty colors and lights.<br />
<br />
8. The AOL car would have only one door but it would have 5 extra seats for<br />
	family members.<br />
<br />
9. Anyone dissatisfied could return the car but must continue to make<br />
	payments for 6 months.<br />
<br />
10. If an AOL car owner received 3 parking tickets AOL would take the car<br />
	off of them.<br />
<br />
11. The AOL car would have an AOL Cell phone that can only place calls to<br />
	other AOL car cell phones.<br />
<br />
12. AOL would pass a new car law forbidding AOL car owners from driving<br />
	near other car dealerships.<br />
<br />
13. AOL car mechanics would have no experience in car repair.<br />
<br />
14. Younger AOL car drivers would be able to make other peoples AOL cars<br />
	stall just for fun.<br />

15. It would not be possible to upgrade your AOL car stereo.<br />
<br />
16. AOL cars would be forced to use AOL gas that cost 20% more and gave<br />
	worse mileage.<br />
<br />
17. Anytime an AOL car owner saw another AOL car owner he would wonder,<br />

   </div><div>If Architects Worked Like Programmers...<br />
     ...Here is How the Request Would Be:<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Architect:<br />
<br />
Please design and build a house for me. I am not quite sure what I need,<br />
so<br />
please use your discretion. My house should have between two and 45<br />
bedrooms. Make sure the plans are such that bedrooms can easily be added<br />
or<br />
deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I will make the final<br />
decision on what I want. Also, bring me the cost breakdown for each<br />
configuration so I can arbitrarily pick one.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the<br />
one<br />
I am currently living in. Make sure, however, that you correct all the<br />
deficiencies that exist in my current house (the floor of my kitchen<br />
vibrates when I walk across it and the walls don't have nearly enough<br />
insulation).<br />
<br />
As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance<br />
costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of<br />
extra-cost<br />
features like aluminum, vinyl or composite siding. (If you choose not to<br />
specify aluminum, be prepared to explain your decision in detail.)<br />
<br />
Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials<br />
are<br />
used in construction of the house, as I want it to be a showplace for the<br />
most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be aware, however, that the kitchen<br />
should be designed to accommodate, among other things, my 1952 Gibson<br />
refrigerator.<br />
<br />
To ensure you are building the correct house for our entire family, make<br />
certain you contact each of our children and also our in-laws. My<br />
mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house should<br />
be<br />
designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure you weigh<br />
all<br />
of these options carefully and come to the right decision. I, however,<br />
retain the right to overrule any choices you make.<br />
<br />
Please don't bother me with small details right now. Your job is to<br />
develop<br />
the overall plans for the house; get the big picture. At this time, for<br />
example, it is not appropriate to choose the color of the carpet.<br />
However,<br />
keep in mind that my wife likes blue.<br />
<br />
Also, do not worry at this time about acquiring the resources to build<br />
the<br />
house itself. Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and<br />
specifications. Once I approve these plans, however, I would expect the<br />
house to be under roof within 48 hours.<br />
<br />
While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind that<br />
sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else. Therefore, it<br />
should appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers. Make sure before you<br />
finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population in my area<br />
that they like the features of this house. I suggest you run up and look<br />
at<br />
my neighbor's house he built last year. We like it a great deal. It has<br />
many features we would also like in our new home, particularly the<br />
75-foot<br />
swimming pool. With careful engineering, I believe you can design this<br />
into<br />
our new house without impacting the final cost.<br />
<br />
Please prepare a complete set of blueprints. It is not necessary at this<br />
time to do the real design, since these blueprints will be used only for<br />
construction bids. Be advised, however, that you will be held accountable<br />
for any increase in construction costs as a result of later design<br />
changes.<br />
You must be thrilled to be working on as interesting a project as this!<br />
To<br />
be able to use the latest techniques and materials, and to be given such<br />
freedom in your designs is something that can't happen very often.<br />
Contact<br />
me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans.<br />
<br />
PS: My wife just told me she disagrees with many of the instructions I've<br />
given you in this letter. As architect, it is your responsibility to<br />
resolve these differences. I have tried in the past and have been unable<br />
to<br />
accomplish this. If you can't handle this responsibility, I will have to<br />
find another architect.<br />
<br />
PPS: Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel trailer.<br />
Please advise me as soon as possible if this is the case.<br />

   </div><div>Customer: Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready to install it now. What do I do first? <br />
Tech Support: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your HEART, ma'am? <br />
Customer: Yes, I have, but there are several other programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running? <br />
Tech Support: What programs are running, ma'am? <br />
Customer: Let's see... I have PAST-HURT.EXE, LOW-ESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE, and RESENTMENT.COM running now. <br />
Tech Support: No problem. LOVE will gradually erase PAST-HURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOW-ESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGH-ESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off, ma'am? <br />
Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? <br />
Tech Support: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until it's erased the programs you don't want. <br />
Customer: Okay, now LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal? <br />
Tech Support: Yes. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message? <br />
Customer: Yes, I do. Is it completely installed? <br />
Tech Support: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTs in order to get the upgrades. <br />
Customer: Oops. I have an error message already. What should I do? <br />
Tech Support: What does the message say? <br />
Customer: It says "ERROR 412-PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS." What does that mean? <br />
Tech Support: Don't worry, ma'am, that's a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTs but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in non-technical terms it means you have to "LOVE" your own machine before it can "LOVE" others. <br />
Customer: So what should I do? <br />
Tech Support: Can you pull down the directory called "SELF-ACCEPTANCE"? <br />
Customer: Yes, I have it. <br />
Tech Support: Excellent. You're getting good at this. Now, click on the following files and then copy them to the "MYHEART" directory: FORGIVE-SELF.DOC, REALIZE-WORTH.TXT, and ACKNOWLEDGE-LIMITATIONS.DOC. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete SELF-CRITIC.EXE from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. <br />
Customer: Got it. Hey! My HEART is filling up with new files. SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM are copying themselves all over my HEART. Is this normal? <br />
Tech Support: Sometimes. For others it takes a while, but eventually everything gets downloaded at the proper time. So, LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. Ah, one more thing. <br />
Customer: Yes? <br />
Tech Support: LOVE is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you meet. They will in turn share it with other people and they will return some similarly cool modules back to you. <br />
Customer: I will! Thanks for your help! <br />

   </div><div>An International View of Y2K<br />
<br />
Most widely used calendars will not have any problem next year.<br />
<br />
In many countries, next year will be 1420.  When the new year starts in each<br />
of those countries will depend on where that country is relative to the<br />
International Lunar Date Lines, or on actual observation of the phase of the<br />
moon.  <br />
<br />
In Israel the next year will be 5760.  <br />
<br />
In Thailand and many other countries it will be 2543. <br />
<br />
In Ethiopia it will be 1991.  <br />
<br />
On Java it will be 1922.  (Is your browser Java enabled?)<br />
<br />
In India the number of the next year is manifold.  For Jains alone, it will<br />
be 2057 and 2527.<br />
<br />
On Indonesian wall calendars each day's box has several date numbers and day<br />
names.  In Bali it is very important to know what day it is.  There are<br />
three cycles of weeks that run simultaneously: each day has a name from the<br />
3 day week, another from the five day week, and one from the seven day week.<br />
Together, the three names name the day.  The year has 210 days.<br />
<br />
Next year will be 89 on Taiwan.  <br />
<br />
Though its number will be 2000 on government forms, a recent survey showed<br />
that almost half of the people in China, when asked, say:<br />
<br />
        Next year will be Dragon.<br />

<br />
 *  You spend half of the plane trip with your laptop on your<br />

<br />
 *  You code your homework in HTML and give your instructor the URL.<br />

    landscape.<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Internet_Cable_Providers.html">Internet Cable Providers</a></h2>
   </div><div>If Internet Companies Provided Cable Service<br />
<br />
  <br />
	TV stations are starting to provide INTERNET access, but could you imagine <br />
	if INTERNET Service Providers were to provide CABLE?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	All the most popular shows would just 'slow down' just because there were too <br />
	many people watching it at once.<br />
<br />
	The nudie channels would make you click your remote saying, "YES, I AM OLD <br />
	ENOUGH, LET ME SEE THE STUFF."<br />
<br />
	When you change channels, there'd be a 5 to 10 second wait with an hourglass <br />
	on the screen while the next channel is connected to. The more people watching <br />
	a show, the longer the hourglass stays there.<br />
<br />
	There'd be a "back" button on the remote so you can take another look at what <br />
	you just watched.<br />
<br />
	Sometimes your TV will complain it cannot "FIND" what you're looking for.<br />
<br />
	You'd be able to make your TV store the things you like, until it gets too full, <br />
	then you'd have to delete a few things.<br />
<br />
	There'd be an arrow on the screen blocking the view, and you'd have to slide <br />
	your remote control around on the coffee table just to change channels.<br />
<br />
	When you complain that you cannot connect your tv and get cable, or that the <br />
	Hourglass is just staying on the screen all the time, they'd say: "Well, were <br />
	busy now, that's the way it goes."<br />
<br />
	You'd be able to instantly be able to send messages to anyone else with a TV. <br />
	The downside of that is that ADVERTISERS would be able to instantly send <br />
	messages to everyone for free as well.<br />
<br />
	They would advertise, "All the TV you can watch for $20 a month!"<br />
<br />
	If you're having poor reception, the technical staff at the station would suggest <br />
	trying to reconnect again, turning your TV OFF and then ON again, Blaming the <br />
	problem on you, Getting you to re-program your TV, and then telling you that <br />
	your TV just isn't good enough and to buy one ten times as fast for about $3000.<br />
<br />
	New software for your TV will make it run slower and require hardware upgrades.<br />
<br />
	After about 1.5 years, your TV would be completely useless for watching, and <br />
	you'd have to go out and buy another TV for about $2500 dollars.<br />
<br />
	You'd have to hire a high school kid to help you set up and connect your TV.<br />
<br />
	They'd take one good COAX cable and split it up into 10000 smaller slower cables, <br />
	1 to each customer.<br />
<br />
	If you have 2 TV's, you'd be able to connect them and have your own Network.<br />
<br />
	The NEWS would be only 5% relevant, full of ads,and messages from people sending, <br />
	"me too" messages.<br />
<br />
	You could pay a lot for a TV now, or you could wait a few months for the price <br />
	to go down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	So I don't think I'll ever get cable from an Internet company... or buy a TV,... <br />
<br />

SCORING:  Give yourself zero points for each "a" response, five for each <br />
"b" and 10 for each "c".<br />
<br />
If you scored 150 or higher, unplug your computer and log<br />
more hours in real life.<br />
<br />
If you scored between 50 and 145, you're living a good mix<br />
of Net and reality.<br />
<br />
If you scored under 50, you probably didn't read this far.<br />

<br />
	******************************************************************<br />
	WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE!<br />
	Gullibility Virus Spreading over the Internet!<br />
	******************************************************************<br />
	WASHINGTON, D.C.-The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular<br />
	Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are<br />
	becoming infected by a new virus that causes them to believe without<br />
	question every groundless story, legend, and dire warning that shows<br />
	up in their inbox or on their browser.  The Gullibility Virus, as it<br />
	is called, apparently makes people believe and forward copies of silly<br />
	hoaxes relating to cookie recipes, e-mail viruses, taxes on modems, and<br />
	get-rich-quick schemes.<br />
<br />
	"These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery<br />
	tickets based on fortune cookie numbers", a spokesman said.  "Most are<br />
	otherwise normal people, who would laugh at the same stories if told<br />
	to them by a stranger on a street corner".  However, once these same<br />
	people become infected with the Gullibility Virus, they believe<br />
	anything they read on the Internet.<br />
	<br />
	"My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone", reported<br />
	one weeping victim.  "I believe every warning message and sick child<br />
	story my friends forward to me, even though most of the messages are<br />
	anonymous."<br />
	<br />
	Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first heard about<br />
	Good Times, I just accepted it without question.  After all, there<br />
	were dozens of other recipients on the mail header, so I thought the	<br />
	virus must be true".  It was a long time, the victim said, before she<br />
	could stand up at a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting and state, "My name is<br />
	Jane, and I've been hoaxed".  Now, however, she is spreading the word.<br />
	"Challenge and check whatever you read," she says.<br />
<br />
	Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the<br />
	virus, which include the following:<br />
	-- The willingness to believe improbable stories without thinking.<br />
	-- The urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others.<br />
	-- A lack of desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story <br />
		is true.<br />
<br />
	T.C. is an example of someone recently infected. He told one reporter,<br />
	"I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos<br />
	makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo".<br />
	<br />
	When told about the Gullibility Virus, T. C. said he would stop<br />
	reading e-mail, so that he would not become infected.<br />
	<br />
	Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately.<br />
	Experts recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet<br />
	users rush to their favorite search engine and look up the item<br />
	tempting them to thoughtless credence.  Most hoaxes, legends, and tall<br />
	tales have been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet community.<br />
	<br />
	Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and<br />
	there is on-line help from many sources, including:<br />

	<br />
	Those people who are still symptom free can help inoculate themselves<br />
	against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good material on<br />
	evaluating sources, such as:<br />

	-- Evaluating Internet Research Sources at<br />

<br />
	It *is* possible to design responsible alerts for people to circulate<br />
	on the Internet.  Here is a how-to that draws positive conclusions<br />

	<br />
	Lastly, as a public service, Internet users can help stamp out the<br />
	Gullibility Virus by sending copies of this message to anyone who<br />
	forwards them a hoax.<br />

   </div><div><br />
No, Windows 95 is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They replicate quickly -- okay, Windows 95 does that.<br />
<br />
Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system<br />
as they do so -- okay, Windows 95 does that.<br />
<br />
Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk -- okay,<br />
Windows 95 does that too.<br />
<br />
Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with<br />
valuable programs and systems. Sigh... Windows 95 does that, too.<br />
<br />
Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is<br />
too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware.  Yup, that's with<br />
Windows 95, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Until now it seems Windows 95 is a virus but there are fundamental<br />
differences:<br />
<br />
Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most<br />
systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they<br />
tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.<br />
<br />
So Windows 95 is not a virus.<br />
<br />
Well see about NT-4<br />

Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer.<br />
This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a<br />
contest, with God as the judge.<br />
<br />
They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type<br />
furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours<br />
straight.<br />
Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes,<br />
taking out the electricity.  Moments later, the power is restored, and<br />
God announces that the contest is over.<br />
<br />
He asks Satan to show what he has come up with.  Satan is visibly upset,<br />
and cries, "I have nothing. I lost it all when the power went out."<br />
<br />
"Very well, then," says God, "let us see if Jesus fared any better."<br />
Jesus enters a command, and the screen comes to life in vivid display,<br />
the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers.  Satan is<br />
astonished.  He stutters, "B-b-but how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus'<br />
program is intact!  How did he do it?"<br />
<br />
God chuckles, "Everybody knows... Jesus saves."<br />

   </div>
   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Jobless_Man_at_Microsoft.html">Jobless Man At Microsoft</a></h2>
   </div><div> .... A jobless man applied for the position of 'office boy' at Microsoft. <br />
  The HR manager interviewed him, then gave him a test, which was to clean the floor. <br />
   After that the HR manager said "You are engaged, give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill, as well as when you will start". <br />
  The man replied, " I don't have a computer, neither an email" I'm sorry", <br />
  <br />
said the HR manager, "if you don't have an email, that means you do not exist. And who doesn't exist, cannot have the job". The man left  with no hope at all. <br />
  He didn't know what to do, with only 10US$ in his pocket. The man then decided to go to the supermarket and buy a 10 Kg tomato crate. He sold the tomatoes in a door-to-door round. In less than two hours, He succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the operation three times, and returned home with 60 US$. <br />
  The man realized that he could survive this way, and started to go everyday earlier, and return late. Thus, his money doubled and tripled day by day. <br />
  Shortly later, he bought a car, then a truck, then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles. <br />
   5 years later, the man became one of the biggest food retailers in the US. <br />
   He started to plan his family's future, and decided to get life insurance. <br />
 He called an insurance broker, and choose a protection plan. <br />
 When the conversation was concluded, the broker asked him for his email. <br />
  The man replied: "I don't have an email". The broker replied curiously, "You don't have an email, and yet have succeeded to build an empire. <br />
  Do you imagine what you could have been if you had an email?"!! <br />
  The man thought for a while, and replied: "an office boy at Microsoft! <br />

   </div><div>Junk Mail 101<br />
by Andrew Hicks<br />
<br />
<br />
		Last year, I wrote a column called "Hate Mail 101." It was one of<br />
	my favorites and turned out to be a favorite of most readers as well. So<br />
	in memory of that and respecting the fact that I have nothing else to<br />
	write about right now, I'm doing a spin off. This time I'll reprint and<br />
	grade ten e-mails, from A+ to F, from the other end of the "unwanted<br />
	mail" spectrum. This is a guide to junk mail, all of which I've received<br />
	this past week. For reference purposes, I'm using each e-mail's subject<br />
	line as its title...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	1. Please Help Me<br />
<br />
<br />
		Ah, the desperation of junk mail. This one reaches new lows,<br />
	declaring, "I don't know what is most important--kids, or the planet our<br />
	kids will live on after we are gone!" So he decides to exploit them both,<br />
	beginning with kids. "FOUR MILLION people will be poisoned this year from<br />
	cleaning products.  Over TEN THOUSAND little kids will DIE this year.<br />
	That is HEARTBREAKING!" Then he talks about how his brother died when he<br />
	was ten and asks, "Are you willing to help save a kid's life?" If you<br />
	are, get ready to buy some all-natural cleaning products, which don't<br />
	poison our water or kill our kids. And just look at that shine! "Some<br />
	people may accuse me of being a profiteer," this poor guy says. He<br />
	doesn't know the half of it, but the sad part is, he'll probably make a<br />
	lot of money on this. Then he'll push his sister overboard so he can sell<br />
	the world the Amazing Non-Slick Ship Deck Mop. The lower these junk mails<br />
	sink, the better they get.  Grade: A.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	2. Re:<br />
<br />
<br />
		Yes, "Re:" was the subject line. This is one of the only junk<br />
	mails circulating that doesn't give any details about the product in the<br />
	subject header, but when you read the mail you see why. They're trying to<br />
	sell you two computer programs called "Virtual Girlfriend" and "Virtual<br />
	Boyfriend," both of which simulate relationship activities for those who<br />
	are unable, or perhaps unwilling, to experience them in real life. "You<br />
	can watch them, talk to them, ask them questions, tell them secrets, and<br />
	relate with them. Watch them as you ask them to take off different<br />
	clothes and guide them through many different activities." If you act<br />
	now, you can also get "Club Celebrity X," a program that puts the<br />
	Hollywood elite in a new light. "You have seen these girls on T.V.,<br />
	Magazines and billboard ads. Now they are on your computer begging for<br />
	action." If you're lucky, you might even get one of them to be your<br />
	virtual girlfriend. The order form itself is the best thing about this<br />
	junk mail; that's where you find out you can get Virtual Girlfriend or<br />
	Virtual Boyfriend for $10, or get them both for just $15.95. That's for<br />
	people who somehow think buying only one of these is not pathetic enough.<br />
	Hint to my friends: Christmas is just around the corner.  A-.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	3. THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO NEEDS MONEY RIGHT NOW!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
		Well, hell, I needs money. So I listened to Dick Hollman when he<br />
	told me his life went from repossessed cars and bill collectors to luxury<br />
	cruises, new cars and "a second home in Virginia," all when "I received a<br />
	letter telling me how to earn $800,000 anytime I wanted to!" How about<br />
	next Tuesday? he asked himself. The scheme is simple. You send the people<br />
	on the list one dollar each and ask them to add your name to their lists.<br />
	Then you send this mail to as many people as you can. Cyrus Huntington<br />
	returned the letter and, three days later, he won the lottery. John<br />
	Hopkins refused to return the letter and, three minutes later, he died.<br />
	The choice is clear, and the sacrifice is little in the long run. As Dick<br />
	writes, "BE HONEST, HAVEN'T YOU 'BLOWN' MONEY IN RESTURANTS OR ON ITEMS<br />
	THAT GIVE ONLY TEMPORARY PLEASURE?" Oh, like, say luxury cruises, new<br />
	cars and a second home in Virginia? Dick's all-caps urgency, his<br />
	insistence that this age-old scam REALLY WORKS, his subject-verb<br />
	disagreement in the subject line and his bringing hope to many pathetic<br />
	individuals actually stupid enough to fall for this e-mail ensure him of<br />
	his place in junk mail history. An instant classic.  A+.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	4. I Make $250 to $1000 A Week!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
		When I first saw this subject line, I thought, "So what, a<br />
	janitor makes at least $250 in a week," but then I realized, this guy is<br />
	working for "One Of The Hottest Most Exciting Marketing Groups On The<br />
	Internet," The One That Capitalizes Every Word They Use. Then this<br />
	anonymous writer declares, "I MADE $160 MY FIRST DAY!!!" Having sex with<br />
	who again? This guy works for the Marketing Warriors, which sounds like<br />
	some community business college football team. It was founded by Allen<br />
	Says, brother of Simon, and plugs some "secret site" where you can<br />
	download millions of e-mail addresses for your personal use, presumably<br />
	so you can send people senseless, unsolicited e-mail like this and learn<br />
	how, among other things, "to print your own money....legally!!" This junk<br />
	mail is all over the place, promising lots of money (probably fake money<br />
	they printed "legally") but offering no details other than the secret<br />
	site, and it has its share of widely varying capitalization. Make it work<br />
	for you.  C+.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	5. Immediate Release:  El Nino update...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
		Perhaps the absolute worst junk mail I've come across lately,<br />
	this one offers to educate investment opportunists "how to take advantage<br />
	of the potential effects of El Nino on the agricultural commodities<br />
	markets!!" This year's El Nino "could be the worst one in 150 years," so<br />
	why not make some money from it by investing in soybeans, corn and wheat,<br />
	the foods that will no doubt reach famine levels of shortage when revaged<br />
	by El Nino? The catch is, you have to commit to a minimum investment of<br />
	$6,000. Now, do you think anyone stupid enough to read past the first<br />
	line of this e-mail really has $6,000 at their disposal? From the same<br />
	people who brought you "Cash in on your grandmother's rape!"  F.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	6. The Cash Cow is MOOING!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
		That's right. You already know the cash rooster is crowing and<br />
	the cash elephant is stampeding, but now the cash cow is mooing. "Call<br />
	the number below and find out how to make thousands of dollars each week<br />
	simply by getting people to call an 800 number! WE DO EVERYTHING ELSE !!!<br />
	!!! WE CLOSE ALL SALES FOR YOU !!! $$$$ 100.00 FAST START CASH * PAYDAY<br />
	EACH FRIDAY $$$$ WE ADVERTISE * WE RECRUIT * WE CLOSE YOUR SALES  ****ALL<br />
	WHILE YOUR AT WORK OR AT PLAY ****  $$$$ START MAKING $ 100.00 BILLS<br />
	RIGHT NOW !!!" People, THIS is an excellent junk mail. All caps, a<br />
	groaner of a subject line, confusing repeated punctuation, use of "your"<br />
	for "you're" and, of course, absolutely no details about what kind of<br />
	business you're entering into. Even the jaded head of a student painter<br />
	scam would be proud.  A+.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	7. MOUSE PADS WITH YOUR FAVORITE PHOTO!   GREAT GIFT!<br />
<br />
<br />
		This one loses a letter grade for being an actual, tangible	<br />
	product and not some kind of pyramid or sales scheme. It also loses a<br />
	letter grade for melding one pathetic product with another. I think we<br />
	all see enough pictures of our friends and family, we don't need to be<br />
	running our mouses across their faces every time we're on the computer.<br />
	Nevetheless, the manufactures think, that for only $14.75 plus shipping,<br />
	"Its time to REPLACE your OLD, DIRTY, FRAYED, BORING mouse pads with<br />
	LOVED ONES, FAMILY, FRIENDS, PETS," and so on, as if to suggest a mouse<br />
	pad with a picture of a loved one would somehow not be boring. Now, if<br />
	someone actually had a pet mouse and wanted to put the mouse's picture on<br />
	the mouse pad, I could see the novelty value, but otherwise, no f'ing<br />
	way. This is no fly-by-night operation, though: "Our Mouse Pads are made<br />
	from the HIGHIEST QUALITY 'NO FRAY' cloth tops and 1/4" deep non-skid<br />
	rubber bottoms." If I'm not mistaken, so are the Virtual Boyfriend and<br />
	Girlfriend accessories. These people do earn a small amount of credit in<br />
	my book for including the line, "We will ship it back to you OR TO ANY<br />
	ADDRESS you prefer!" which opens up endless possibilities for sending<br />
	enemies obscene photos. And since these mouse pads are of the "HIGHIEST<br />
	QUALITY," the enemies would probably end up using them.  D+.<br />
	<br />
	8. Make money From People Watching TV<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
		I got this one three times in a row. It starts with the line,	<br />
	"Just Released," probably describing the author's parole. This e-mail<br />
	describes some kind of vague digital satellite sales job, "setting up<br />
	people with DSS satellite equipment at no charge. As a representative<br />
	with our company, you will get paid between $25 and $100 for 'giving<br />
	away' Digital Direct Satellite Dishes." So they pay you to give away<br />
	their equipment? They don't explain how they make money doing this, but<br />
	rest assured there is illegal activity involved. The fact that "giving<br />
	away" is in quotes suggests something sinister, like perhaps that they've<br />
	"borrowed" the satellite dishes from some electronics store. The closing<br />
	line reads, "If you are ready for the greatest business opportunity to<br />
	come down the pike, don't miss this one, it is only 2 months old!!!"<br />
	Younger is better in junk mail; you have to go with a company that has<br />
	not proven itself at all, whose business strategies don't make any sense<br />
	and who put words in quotes. Overall, very effective.  B+!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	9. A personal message...<br />
<br />
<br />
		Shannon Johnson, CEO, writes, "I have to tell you that I am<br />
	really angry and upset about what is going on here on the Internet. We at<br />
	Success Concepts are so angry, in fact, that we decided to do something<br />
	about it." More specifically, they decided to make everyone else angry by<br />
	sending them junk e-mail. This one, like so many others, offers to sell<br />
	you everyone else's e-mail addresses so you can bug the hell out of them<br />
	like they do. This is unremarkable junk mail -- where are the screaming,<br />
	all-caps promises? Where are the missing details of shady business? Where<br />
	are the erotic software offers?  D.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	<br />
	10. I know all about you...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
		This subject line was followed by the promise, "Now YOU CAN KNOW<br />
	TOO..." So I'm supposed to pay you so I can know about me? Okay, let me<br />
	get my checkbook... I admit, when you see e-mail with a subject line like<br />
	that, you read it. You want to make sure you're not being blackmailed,<br />
	that no one knows about you and Marv Albert and the three drunken flight<br />
	attendants last May. Then this guy tries to sell you information on how<br />
	to find dirt on everyone. "Check out your spouse, or even your daughter's<br />
	new boyfriend!" And I'm sure he knows what I did last summer, but the<br />
	lack of any personal details to freak me out kept me from falling for the<br />
	scheme. Now, if he would have said anything about May with Marv, I would<br />
	have been sold.  C-.<br />
	<br />

   </div><div>Laptops in Recent Movies<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        Four of the biggest films of 1996 -- Twister, Eraser, Mission<br />
Impossible and Independence Day -- have one thing in common besides<br />
box-office success: in each film, portable computers played a prominent<br />
role.  We decided to put the portable computers in these flims to the<br />
test and asnwer once and for all the question, "Hey, if I happen to find<br />
myself in a big-budget Hollywood movie, which portable computer will<br />
give me the<br />
best performance?<br />
<br />
TWISTER<br />
        Twister featured a Silicon Graphics laptop, which is intesting<br />
since Silicon Graphics doens't make laptops. Nevertheless, a label<br />
reading "Silicon Graphics" was placed conspicuously on the computer,<br />
because you just never know when you might forget the brand name of your<br />
computer.  Overall, this computer performed more than adequately. For<br />
one thing, it was robust. While seemingly everything else in the movie<br />
was sucked into the tornado, the Silicon Graphics laptop was unharmed.<br />
This is incredible when you think about it. Houses, cows and even an<br />
18-wheeler were blown away by tornadoes, but this computer remained<br />
undamaged, even when it was used at one point as an umbrella.<br />
        Aside from personal bad-weather protection, another important<br />
feature of the Silicon Graphics laptop was its ability not to<br />
self-destruct due to the complete inanity of the script. My sources tell<br />
me that many lesser computers were unable to make it through the first<br />
third of the film without a system error.<br />
        One computer actually exploded in the first 20 mintues after a<br />
particularly silly scene involving the fiancee of Bill Paxton's<br />
character. But not the Silicon Graphics laptop. It kept on performing at<br />
a high level. If the big-budget film you're in happens to have a script<br />
with all the subtlety of a bad Baywatch episode, then the Silicon<br />
Graphics laptop is definitely the computer for you, even if it doesn't<br />
exist.<br />
<br />
ERASER<br />
        Eraser also featured a portable computer.  Unfortunately, I do<br />
not know which portable computer it was. Neither does anyone at Warner<br />
Brothers, including Steve in Product Placement, who informed me, "I'm<br />
sorry, this office cannot comment on that."<br />
        It really doesn't matter, though, because the Unknown Laptop is<br />
a real disappointment. About all that can be said in its favor is that<br />
it didn't blow up. Admittedly, that's an accomplishment. After all,<br />
practically everything else in the movie exploded, sometimes more than<br />
once. If you do find yourself in a flick with lots of exploding<br />
buildings and houses, you might want to find out what computer this one<br />
is. Just don't ask Steve in Product Placement, because he can't comment.<br />
        Where the Unknown Laptop comes up really short is in<br />
performance. For example, early in the film Vanessa William's character<br />
copies important files onto a CD-ROM(!). When she arrives home and<br />
attempts to open the files with her laptop, she finds that the CD-ROM<br />
will not run, thus making the computer completely useless for the film.<br />
Because of this defect, Williams and Arnold Schwarzenegger must break<br />
into CIA headquarters and open the classified files from within the<br />
high-security building.<br />
        Admittedly, this may be more of a software problem than a<br />
hardware problem. Microsoft is now working on a plug-in for Windows 95<br />
that will allow users to open classified documents stolen from the CIA,<br />
but the original release date was set for November 1995. After countless<br />
delays, Microsoft now refuses to set a new date for the release.  The<br />
truth is that it might be several years before an operating system is<br />
available that will reliably open classified documents stolen from the<br />
CIA.<br />
        Furthermore, Herbert Naylor, an imaginary spokesman for<br />
Microsoft, claims that this defect is really not a problem. "The movie,"<br />
he rightly says, "was starting to drag at that point, and if not for the<br />
computer failing, the screenwriters might never have come up with a<br />
reason for the characters to break into the CIA."  This is a salient<br />
point, and one the serious computer user must consider. Among the<br />
computers reviewed here, the Unkonwn Laptop was clearly the best at<br />
moving the plot along.<br />
<br />
<br />
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE<br />
        One of the stars of Mission Impossible was a Macintosh PowerBook<br />
540C.  I know this because I called Apple Computer, and they were<br />
positively giddy to tell me about all the Apple computers used in films<br />
this summer. They'd probably still be talking to me right now, if I<br />
hadn't come up with an excuse to end the conversation.<br />
        In this film, the Macintosh advantage is clear. Whereas the<br />
Unknown Laptop was unable to open classified files, Tom Cruise's<br />
PowerBook did not have the same problem. It easily handled classified<br />
information. Nevertheless, the PowerBook 540C did display some flaws.<br />
For example, many of the most popular lists of classified information<br />
take several months longer to be released for the Macintosh platform,<br />
but the PowerBook 540C's superior ability in opening classified files<br />
makes it well worth the wait. One can only hope this will persuade<br />
developers to release more lists of classified information for the<br />
Macintosh.<br />
        Another interesting feature of this PowerBook is its superior<br />
acting ability. For example, in several scenes the PowerBook managed to<br />
outact Cruise. True, this is not that difficult an accomplishment. (In<br />
one scene, the leg of a table in the corner of the screen outacted<br />
Cruise for several seconds). Nevertheless, it is always impressive when<br />
a portable computer manges to outperform the lead actor.<br />
        You may have mixed feelings about this. If you're the type of<br />
actor who likes to be surrounded by superior actors in the hopes that<br />
this will make the movie that much more successful, then the PowerBook<br />
540C is for you. However, if you're at all worried about being upstaged,<br />
you might want to consider another model.<br />
<br />
INDEPENDENCE DAY<br />
        Independence Day (or: How I Saved the World From Destruction<br />
With a PowerBook) featured a Macintosh PowerBook 5300. This movie is<br />
where the Macintosh really shines. While the other computers performed<br />
adequately in their films, no other portable computer was able to save<br />
the world from alien desruction. Therefore, the PowerBook 5300 is our<br />
selection as the best portable computer of the group.<br />
        Remember the old days when connecting to alien spaceships by<br />
modem took hours of confusing configuration, and was sometimes<br />
impossible because you lacked the proper drivers? With the PowerBook<br />
5300, that era has come to an end. Everything on it is preinstalled.<br />
Just point and click, and you are all set. Thanks to Apple's new<br />
technology, you can even use your modem to play Doom against alien<br />
lifeforms.<br />
        Equally impressive is the fact that Apple seems to have<br />
eliminated the problem of screen freezes. Not once in the entire film<br />
did the computer freeze, forcing Jeff Goldblum to reboot. For me, this<br />
was even more unbelievable than the concept of aliens rom another planet<br />
coming down to Earth and trying to destroy the human race.<br />
        If Goldblum had had to use my Macintosh, instead, the scene near<br />
the end in which he and Will Smith fly to the alien mothership to upload<br />
a computer virus may have turned out entirely different:<br />
        GOLDBLUM: Okay, all we have to do is wait for it to upload the<br />
virus into the alien mothership. Oh, damn! It's stopped! The screen<br />
froze!<br />
        SMITH: Don't be giving me none of that freeze stuff! I told you<br />
we should have used a PC!<br />
        GOLDBLUM: It'll be okay. We just have to restart the computer.<br />
        SMITH: We got three minutes.<br />
        GOLDBLUM: Three minutes! I can't restart a Mac in three minutes!<br />
Aaaargh! We're all gonna die!<br />
        At this point, the human race would have been destroyed, the<br />
movie would have ended, and audiences across the nation wouldn't have<br />
been as pleased. But the PowerBook 5300 in Independence Day saved the<br />
day, proving that Apple has again become a serious player. If you find<br />
yourself in a big-budget film in which the existence of the human race<br />
is in your hands, you have no choice but to buy the PowerBook 5300.<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Learn_from_the_Movies.html">Learn From The Movies</a></h2>
   </div><div>24 Things You Learn About Computers From the Movies<br />
<br />
<br />
  1. Word processors never display a cursor.<br />
<br />
  2. You never have to use the spacebar when typing long sentences.<br />
<br />
  3. All monitors display 2 inch high letters.<br />
<br />
  4. High-tech computers, such as those used by NASA, the CIA, or some<br />
     such governmental institution, have easy-to-understand graphical<br />
     interfaces.<br />
<br />
  5. Those that don't will have incredibly powerful text-based command<br />
     shells that can correctly understand and execute commands typed in<br />
     plain English.<br />
<br />
  6. Corollary: You can gain access to any information you want by<br />
     simply typing "ACCESS ALL OF THE SECRET FILES" on any keyboard.<br />
<br />
  7. Likewise, you can infect a computer with a destructive virus by<br />
     simply typing "UPLOAD VIRUS."  Viruses cause temperatures in<br />
     computers, just like they do in humans.  After a while, smoke<br />
     billows out of disk drives and monitors.<br />
<br />
  8. All computers are connected. You can access the information on<br />
     the villain's desktop computer, even if it's turned off.<br />
<br />
  9. Powerful computers beep whenever you press a key or whenever the<br />
     screen changes. Some computers also slow down the output on the<br />
     screen so that it doesn't go faster than you can read. The *really*<br />
     advanced ones also emulate the sound of a dot-matrix printer as <br />
     the characters come across the screen.<br />
<br />
 10. All computer panels have thousands of volts and flash pots just<br />
     underneath the surface. Malfunctions are indicated by a bright<br />
     flash, a puff of smoke, a shower of sparks, and an explosion that<br />
     forces you backward. (See #7, above)<br />
<br />
 11. People typing away on a computer will turn it off without saving<br />
     the data.<br />
<br />
 12. A hacker can get into the most sensitive computer in the world<br />
     before intermission and guess the secret password in two tries.<br />
<br />
 13. Any PERMISSION DENIED has an OVERRIDE function.<br />
<br />
 14. Complex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data will be<br />
     accomplished in under three seconds. In the movies, modems transmit<br />
     data at two gigabytes per second.<br />
<br />
 15. When the power plant/missile site/whatever overheats, all the<br />
     control panels will explode, as will the entire building.<br />
<br />
 16. If you display a file on the screen and someone deletes the file, <br />
     it also disappears from the screen.  There are no ways to copy a <br />
     backup file -- and there are no undelete utilities.<br />
<br />
 17. If a disk has got encrypted files, you are automatically asked<br />
     for a password when you try to access it.<br />
<br />
 18. No matter what kind of computer disk it is, it'll be readable by<br />
     any system you put it into. All application software is usable by<br />
     all computer platforms.<br />
<br />
 19. The more high-tech the equipment, the more buttons it has.  However,<br />
     everyone must have been highly trained, because the buttons aren't <br />
     labelled.<br />
<br />
 20. Most computers, no matter how small, have reality-defying<br />
     three-dimensional, real-time, photo-realistic animated graphics<br />
     capability.<br />
<br />
 21. Laptops, for some strange reason, always seem to have amazing<br />
     real-time video phone capabilities and the performance of a<br />
     CRAY-MP.<br />
<br />
 22. Whenever a character looks at a VDU, the image is so bright that<br />
     it projects itself onto his/her face.<br />
<br />
 23. Computers never crash during key, high-intensity activities.<br />
     Humans operating computers never make mistakes under stress.<br />
<br />
 24. Programs are fiendishly perfect and never have bugs that slow<br />
     down users.<br />

<br />
For those of you not blessed/cursed by living on UNH campus, Telecomm<br />
has offered those of us in the dorms direct PPP lines.  They connect<br />
to our serial ports and run at a nifty (for the dorms anyways) 38400.<br />
Of course, being the brilliant folks they are, they give you a 16 bit<br />
version of winsock ('Lose '95 won't do it's built in PPP thing<br />
through a serial port), so you can't run a lot of software.  I<br />
managed to get the upgraded version for 32 bit connections, so it<br />
works swell now.  The problem comes in when I tried to get my linux<br />
box hooked up.<br />
<br />
I got the ppp daemon compiled, the script written - everything seemed<br />
keen.  The problem started when I tried running it.  It connects - I<br />
can resolve host names, etc, but for some reason, data transfers<br />
REALLY slow for some things ... like telnet.  You can't even telnet<br />
TO my machine at all.  The weird thing is that ping works fine.<br />
<br />
My next move after playing with it for a while?  Call the help desk! <br />
<br />
Here's how it went:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(after waiting for about 20 minutes on hold)<br />
<br />
Supposed Tech: "Hi - how can I help you?"<br />
<br />
Me: "Hi - I'm trying to hook up my linux box via PPP and I'm running<br />
into some problems.  It works fine under '95, but I can't seem to get<br />
it to connect right under linux.  I can resolve hostnames and even<br />
..."<br />
<br />
T: "Um, sir - what kind of computer is it?"<br />
<br />
Me: "IBM compatible.  Specifically, an Ambra."<br />
<br />
T: "Ok - what happens when you try running Trumpet Winsock?"<br />
<br />
* Slapping my forehead... *<br />
Me: "This is linux.  It doesn't run Trumpet Winsock."<br />
<br />
T: "Oh - it's a DOS program?"<br />
<br />
* sigh *<br />
Me: "No - it's an operating system.  Trumpet runs fine under '95."<br />
(Well, after I upgraded to a 32 bit version on my own, anyways)<br />
<br />
T: "Well, have you tried running this program under '95 then?"<br />
<br />
* aggh!! *<br />
Me: "No - it IS an operating system.  It doesn't run under another <br />
operating system."<br />
<br />
T: "Oh.  Ok - so what happens when you try to run Winsock under it?"<br />
<br />
(murdurous thoughts are beginning to go through my head)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After a couple more exchanges back and forth, she finally understands<br />
that Winsock won't run under linux for some weird reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Me: "So, can I get an incident number so I can talk to a tech?"<br />
<br />
T: "Sure - I just need to get some info from you..."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She gets down my name, room number, phone number, computer type and <br />
brand, then we get interesting again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
T: "Ok - so is this under Windows 3.1 or Windows '95?"<br />
<br />
Me: "Neither - it's linux."<br />
<br />
T: "Which type of Windows does it run under though?"<br />
<br />
(I'm sharpening my axe now...)<br />
<br />
Me: "Neither!  It runs on it's own!"<br />
<br />
T: "Oh!!!  Oh!  I'm sorry, in that case we can't help you.  We only <br />
support Windows 3.1 and Windows '95."<br />
<br />
Me: "WHAT?!?"<br />
<br />
T: "Sorry - that's all we're currently supporting.  Have a nice day."<br />
<br />
&lt;Click&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, does anybody know where we hire these people?  8)<br />

How to know that you are in 2003:<br />
<br />
1-You accidentally enter your password on the<br />
microwave.<br />
<br />
2- You haven't played solitaire with real cards in<br />
years.<br />
<br />
3-. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach<br />
your family of 3.<br />
<br />
4-You e-mail your mate who works at the desk next to<br />
you.<br />
<br />
5- Your reason for not staying in touch with friends<br />
is that they do not have e-mail addresses.<br />
<br />
6- When you go home after a long day at work you<br />
still answer the phone in a business manner.<br />
<br />
7- When you make phone calls from home, you<br />

<br />
8- You've sat at the same desk for four years and<br />
worked for three different companies<br />
<br />
10- You read this entire list, and kept nodding and<br />
smiling.<br />
<br />
11- As you read this list, you think about<br />
forwarding it to your "friends"<br />
<br />
12- You got this email from a friend that never<br />
talks to you any more, except to send you jokes from<br />
the net.<br />
<br />
13- You are too busy to notice there was no No. 9<br />
<br />
14- You actually scrolled back up to check that<br />
there wasn't a No.9 (Bet you all did this one!?!?!?)<br />

<br />
<br />
Have a nice Day <br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Lunch_at_HP.html">Lunch At HP</a></h2>
   </div><div>This is the story of a different kind. No melting CPU's, no<br />
screaming disc drives, just the kind of psychological torture that<br />
scars a man for life.<br />
 <br />
I had a 9:00 meeting with my HP sales rep. I needed to buy an<br />
entire new series 70--the works. He said it would take about an hour.<br />
Three hours later, we'd barely gotten the datacomm hardware down on<br />
paper, so he invited me downstairs for lunch.<br />
 <br />
This was my first experience in an HP cafeteria. Above the service<br />
counter was a menu which began . . . .<br />
 <br />
<br />
MMUs (Main Menu Units)<br />
 <br />
00010A   Burger. Includes sesame-seed bun.<br />
         Must order condiments 00110A separately<br />
 <br />
   001   Deletes seeds.<br />
   002   Expands burger to two patties.<br />
 <br />
00020A   Double cheeseburger, preconfigured. Includes cheese, bun and<br />
         condiments.<br />
 <br />
   001   Add-on bacon.<br />
   002   Delete second patty.<br />
   003   Replaces second patty with extra cheese.<br />
 <br />
00021A   Burger Upgrade to Double Cheeseburger<br />
 <br />
   001   From Single Burger.<br />
   002   From Double Burger.<br />
   003   Return credit for bun.<br />
 <br />
00220A   Burger Bundle. Includes 00010A, 00210A and 00310A<br />
 <br />
   001   Substitute root beer 00311A for cola 00310A.<br />
<br />
<br />
My eyes glazed over.  I asked for a burger and a root beer.  The<br />
waitress looked at me like I was an alien.<br />
 <br />
"How would you like to order that, sir?"  "Quickly, if possible.  <br />
Can't I just order a sandwich and a drink?"  "No sir.  All our<br />
service is menu driven.  Now what would you like?"  I scanned the<br />
menu.  "How big is the 00010 burger?"  "The patty is rated at eight<br />
bites."  "Well, how about the rest of it?"  "I don't have the specs on<br />
that, sir, but I think it's a bit more."  "Eight bites is too small.<br />
Give me the Double Burger Upgrade."<br />
 <br />
My sales rep interrupted.  "No, you want the Single Burger option<br />
002 'expands burger to two patties.'  The double burger upgrade<br />
would give you two burgers.<br />
 <br />
"But you could get return credit on the extra bun," the waitress<br />
chimed in, trying to be helpful, "although it isn't documented."<br />
 <br />
I looked around to see if anybody was staring at me.  There was a<br />
couple in line behind us.  I recognized one of them, a guy who<br />
nearly mowed me down in the parking lot with his cherry-red '62<br />
Vette.  He was talking to some woman who was waving her arms around<br />
and looking very excited.<br />
 <br />
"What if . . . we marketed the bacon cheeseburger with the vegetable<br />
option and without the burger and cheese?  It would be a BLT!"<br />
 <br />
The woman charged off in the direction of the telephone, running<br />
steeplechases over tables and chairs.  My waitress tried to get my<br />
attention again.  "Have you decided, sir?"<br />
 <br />
"Yeah, give me the double burger--excuse me, I mean the 00020A with<br />
the option 001.  I want everything on it."  She put me down for the<br />
Condiment Expansion Kit, which included mayonnaise, mustard and<br />
pickles with a option to substitute relish.<br />
 <br />
"Ketchup."  I hated to ask.  "I want ketchup on that, too."  "That's<br />
not a condiment, sir, it's a Tomato Product."  My sales rep butted in<br />
again.  "Thats not a supported configuration."  "What now?" I kept my<br />
voice steady.  "Too juicy.  The bun can't handle it."  "Look. Forget<br />
the ketchup, just put some lettuce and tomatoes on it."<br />
 <br />
The waitress backed away from the counter.  "I'm sorry, sir, but<br />
thats not supported either, the bun can take it but the burger won't<br />
fit in the box.  The sales rep defended himself.  "Just not at first<br />
release."  "It is being beta-tested, sir."<br />
 <br />
I checked the overhead screen.  Fries, number 000210A, option 110.  <br />
French, followed by option 120, English.  "What the hell are English<br />
Fries?"  I turned to the sales rep.  "Chips they call them.  We sell<br />
a lot of them."<br />
 <br />
I gave up.  "OK, OK just give me a plain vanilla Burger Bundle."  The<br />
confused the waitress profoundly.  "Sir, Vanilla as an option is<br />
configured only for series 00450 Milkshakes."  My sales rep chuckles.  <br />
"No ma'am, he just wants a standard 00220A off the shelf."  I<br />
wondered how long it had been on the shelf.  I didn't ask.<br />
 <br />
"Very good, sir."  The waitress breathed a sigh of relief.  "Your<br />
meal is now on order.  Now how would you like it supported?"  <br />
"Support?"  She directed me to the green shaded area at the bottom of<br />
the menu, and I began a litany with my Sales Rep that I'll never<br />
forget.<br />
 <br />
"Implementation assistance?"<br />
 <br />
"You get a waiter."<br />
 <br />
"Implementation analysis?"<br />
 <br />
"You tell him how hungry you are and he tells you what to eat."<br />
 <br />
"Response Center Support?"<br />
 <br />
"He brings it to your table."<br />
 <br />
"Extended materials?"<br />
 <br />
"You get refills."<br />
 <br />
I stuffed some money at the waitress and told her to take it.  She<br />
gave me my check on three sheets of green-bar paper.  I studied it<br />
on my way to the table, and decided it would pass as an emergency<br />
napkin.<br />
 <br />
Table?  My Sales Rep had been bright enough to order us a table.  He<br />
hadn't been bright enough to check on a delivery date.  The table<br />
waiter slouching in his corner surveyed the crowded room, looked at<br />
me and said, "Two weeks.  But I can get you a stand alone chair by<br />
the window right away."<br />
 <br />
I handed him the tray.  A woman rushed up to me with two small cups<br />
of chili and sauerkraut for a hot dog somebody else had ordered.  <br />
The room began to grow dim, my eyesight faded . . . .<br />
 <br />
I woke up clutching the water glass at my bedside table.  It was<br />
five AM, four hours till my meeting with HP.  I had had a vision, I<br />
did what it told me to do.  I dialed my office, and I called in<br />
sick.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
These are the unwritten rules from the highly over worked, but<br />
highly under paid technical support staff at an Internet service<br />
provider near you...<br />
<br />
<br />
  DO NOT talk over me.  Listen damn it, you can't do what I<br />
tell you to do constantly jabbering bullshit over me. I talk...<br />
you do. Why did you even ask me a question if you are going to<br />
answer it?<br />
   DO NOT call me and then put me on hold.  You called me,<br />
genius!  You want my help, stay on the line and listen. We have<br />
much better things to do than talk to you anyway.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT read long error messages to me unless I ask you to.<br />
Do you honestly think we get anything out of a 50 digit hex<br />
number???<br />
<br />
    DO NOT start off a call by saying anything in the neighborhood<br />
of "Hi, how's it going" or "busy today?" That just serves to piss<br />
us off.  Get to the problem so we can get you off the phone. The<br />
day was great until I had to start answering your totally moronic<br />
questions.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT get pissed when we tell you that your system is royally<br />
screwed. We didn't screw it up.  It wasn't us.  We're simply<br />
telling it like it is.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call about unrelated products.  We DO NOT know the<br />
intimate details of every piece o' crap shareware program you<br />
dredge out of the Internet.  Nor do we want to.  Stop it!<br />
<br />
    We DO NOT manufacture modems, write e-mail programs or<br />
engineer browsers.  If something in this arena goes wrong, call<br />
the people who made the goddamned thing.  YOU DON'T USE THE<br />
INTERNET  TO FAX!!! Can't stress that one enough.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT compare us to AOL when something goes wrong with your<br />
connection to us.  If you had the computer literacy of an 8 year<br />
old with a broken Atari 2600 you'd know better.  Everyone else<br />
connects just fine. It's just you. Keep that in mind.  It's just<br />
you.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call simply for the purpose of giving us your thoughts<br />
on the content of our home page or to request that we send you<br />
flyers so you can pass them out at bridge tournaments and bingo<br />
night.  Not only is this a waste of our time, but it encourages<br />
just the type of user tech support reps fear most...  the elderly.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT make us sit there on the phone while you tip toe<br />
through setup instructions so easy they were originally tested<br />
on lab chimps.  We have better things to do than act as zoo<br />
keepers.<br />
<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call us and complain about a problem with your system<br />
and then say you're not in front of your computer when we try and<br />
help you. We aren't technological psychics.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call us assuming the problem you're experiencing is<br />
our fault. If your computer crashes, performs illegal operations,<br />
gives you the blue screen of death, or flips you off and runs away<br />
with the toaster to Mexico, you can be damn certain it isn't us<br />
who caused it.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call us and announce to us that you don't know<br />
anything about computers. This really pisses us off.  Trust me,<br />
we're well aware of that fact. We figured it out the minute you<br />
called and announced "help, the Internet is broken!"  Something<br />
here definitely needs help.  People who know computers don't call<br />
us.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call us and act as if you know all that are computers<br />
and that you're doing us a favour by gracing us with your call.<br />
This pisses us off more than 13.  Chiming in with stupid<br />
suggestions and comments only increases the already tremendous<br />
temptation we face to use you as an unwitting instrument of<br />
destruction and really do some damage to your system.  Not that<br />
you'd notice.<br />
<br />
   DO NOT (in addition to 14) say acronyms you don't know the<br />
meaning of or even what they are for. Just admit that you're<br />
completely lost and leave the techno bullshit to us.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call in if you can't speak English.  This might seem<br />
like a small thing to you, but we find it just a tad annoying<br />
when we try and assess your problem and we can only understand<br />
every fifth word you say. And no, just because those words may be<br />
'computer' or 'broken' doesn't absolve you of the offense.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT call in hoping to get another tech rep to tell you<br />
something different than the first one did.  If one of us tells<br />
you your system is screwed, it's screwed.  The second guy is<br />
going to simply look at the log and tell you the same thing, it's<br />
screwed. That is of course unless you really piss him off and<br />
then he's going to make sure your computer has the functionality<br />
of a house plant.<br />
<br />
    DO NOT be stoned or drunk when you call us.  You wouldn't<br />
think this would need to actually be said, but believe me it's<br />
come up. For god sakes, if you can't control yourself and must<br />
call, at least have the common courtesy to offer us some of what<br />
you're on.<br />

   </div><div>Mouse Balls<br />
<br />
<br />
 This is an actual alert to IBM Field Engineers that went out to<br />
 all IBM Branch Offices.  The person who wrote it was very serious.<br />
 The rest of us may find it rather funny.<br />
<br />
 Abstract:  Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit)<br />
<br />
 Mouse balls are now available as FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse<br />
 fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a<br />
 ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of this<br />
 procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by<br />
 properly trained personnel.<br />
<br />
 Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining<br />
 the underside of the mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and<br />
 harder than foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ<br />
 depending upon manufacturer of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be<br />
 replaced using the pop-off method.  Domestic balls are replaced<br />
 using the twist-off method.  Mouse balls are not usually static<br />
 sensitive.  However, excessive handling can result in sudden<br />
 discharge.  Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be<br />
 used immediately.<br />
<br />
 It is recommended that each replacer have a pair of spare balls<br />
 for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction, and that any<br />
 customer missing his balls should suspect local personnel of<br />
 removing these necessary items.<br />
<br />
 To re-order, specify one of the following:<br />

There are three engineers in a car; an electrical engineer, a chemical engineer and a Microsoft engineer. Suddenly the car just stops by the side of the road, and the three engineers look at each other wondering what could be wrong. <br />
<br />
The electrical engineer suggests stripping down the electronics of the car and trying to trace where a fault might have occurred. <br />
<br />
The chemical engineer, not knowing much about cars, suggests that maybe the fuel is becoming emulsified and getting blocked somewhere. <br />
<br />
Then, the Microsoft engineer, not knowing much about anything, comes up with a suggestion, "Why don't we close all the windows, get out, get back in, open the windows again, and maybe..."<br />

   </div><div>Mom and Understanding Computers<br />
<br />
	For years I badgered my mother with questions about whether Santa<br />
	Claus is a real person or not. Her answer was always "Well, you asked<br />
	for the presents and they came, didn't they?" I finally understood the<br />
	full meaning  of her reply when I heard the definition of a virtual<br />
	device: "A software or  hardware entity which responds to commands in<br />
	a manner indistinguishable from the real device." Mother was telling<br />
	me that Santa Claus is a virtual person (simulated by loving parents)<br />
	who responds to requests from children  in a manner indistinguishable<br />
	from the real saint.<br />
<br />
	Mother also taught the IF ... THEN ... ELSE structure: "If it's<br />
	snowing, then put your boots on before you go to school;<br />
	otherwise just wear your shoes."<br />
	<br />
	Mother explained the difference between batch and transaction<br />
	processing:<br />
<br />
	"We'll wash the white clothes when we get enough of them to make<br />
	a load, but  we'll wash these socks out right now by hand because<br />
	you'll need them this afternoon."<br />
	<br />
	Mother taught me about linked lists. Once, for a birthday party,<br />
	she laid  out a treasure hunt of ten hidden clues, with each clue<br />
	telling where to  find the next one, and the last one leading to the<br />
	treasure. She then gave  us  the first clue.<br />
	<br />
	Mother understood about parity errors. When she counted socks<br />
	after doing  the laundry, she expected to find an even number and<br />
	groaned when only one  sock of a pair emerged from the washing<br />
	machine. Later she applied the principles of redundancy engineering to<br />
	this problem by buying our socks three identical pairs at a time. This<br />
	greatly increased the odds of being  able to come up with at least one<br />
	matching pair.<br />
	<br />
	Mother had all of the children write letters then mailed in a single<br />
	envelope with a single stamp. This was obviously an instance of<br />
	blocking records in order to save money by reducing the number <br />
	of physical I/O operations.<br />
	<br />
	Mother used flags to help her manage the housework. Whenever she<br />
	turned on the stove, she put a potholder on top of her purse to<br />
	reminder herself to  turn it off again before leaving the house.<br />
	<br />
	Mother knew about devices which raise an interrupt signal to be<br />
	serviced when they have completed any operation. She had a<br />
	whistling teakettle.<br />
	<br />
	Mother understood about LIFO ordering. In my lunch bag she put<br />
	the dessert on the bottom, the sandwich in the middle, and the<br />
	napkin on top so that  things would come out in the right order<br />
	at lunchtime.<br />
	<br />
	There is an old story that God knew He couldn't be physically<br />
	present everywhere at once, to show His love for His people, and<br />
	so He created mothers. That is the difference between centralized and<br />
	distributed processing. As any kid who's ever misbehaved at a<br />
	neighbor's house finds out, all the mothers in the neighborhood talk<br />
	to each other. That's a local area network of distributed processors<br />
	that can't be beat.<br />
	<br />
	Mom, you were the best computer teacher I ever had.<br />

   </div><div>   Is your computer male or female? As you are aware, ships have long<br />
   been characterized as being female (e.g., "Steady as she goes", or<br />
   "She's listing to starboard, Captain!"). Recently, a group of computer<br />
   scientists (all males) announced that computers should also be<br />
   referred to as being female. Their reasons for drawing this conclusion<br />
   follow:<br />
<br />
     1.  No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.<br />
<br />
     2.  The native language they use to communicate with other<br />
     computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.<br />
<br />
     3.  The message "Bad command or file name" is about as informative<br />
     as, "If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not<br />
     going totell you".<br />
<br />
     4.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for<br />
     later retrieval.<br />
<br />
     5.  As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself<br />
     spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. However, another<br />
     group of computer scientists (all female) think that computers<br />
     should be referred to as if they were   male.  Their reasonsfollow:<br />
<br />
     1.  They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.<br />
<br />
     2.  They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time<br />
     they are the problem.<br />
<br />
     3.  As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had<br />
     waited a little longer, you could have obtained a better model.<br />
<br />
     4.  In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br />
<br />
     5.  Big power surges knock them out for the rest of the night.<br />

At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the<br />
computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If G.M. had kept up<br />
with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving<br />
twenty-five dollar cars that got one-thousand miles to the gallon." In<br />
response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating,<br />
"If G.M. had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving<br />
cars with the following characteristics:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br />
 <br />
  Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a<br />
new car.<br />
<br />
  Occasionally, your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you<br />
would just accept this, restart, and drive on.<br />
<br />
  Occasionally, executing a manner such as a left turn, would cause your<br />
car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to<br />
reinstall the engine.<br />
<br />
  Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought "Car95" or<br />
"CarNT." But then you would have to buy more seats.<br />
<br />
  Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, reliable, five<br />
times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would but would only run on<br />
five percent of the roads.<br />
<br />
  The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would be<br />
replaced by a single "general car default" warning light.<br />
<br />
  New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.<br />
<br />
 The airbag system would say "Are you sure?" before going off.<br />
<br />
  Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and<br />
refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned<br />
the key, and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.<br />
<br />
  G.M. would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand<br />
McNally road maps (now a G.M. subsidiary), even though they neither need<br />
them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause<br />
the car's performance to diminish by fifty percent or more. Moreover, G.M.<br />
would become a target for investigation by the Justice Department.<br />
<br />
  Every time G.M. introduced a new model, car buyers would have to learn<br />
how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in<br />
the same manner as the old car.<br />
<br />
  You'd press the "start" button to shut off the engine.<br />

<br />
<br />
     Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced that it<br />
     is selling advertising space in the error messages<br />
     that appear in Windows. Acknowledging for the<br />
     first time that the average user of their<br />
     operating system encounters error messages at<br />
     least several times a day, Microsoft is trying to<br />
     take financial advantage of the unavoidable<br />
     opportunity to make an ad impression.<br />
<br />
     "We estimate that throughout the world at<br />
     any given moment several million people are<br />
     getting a `General Protection Fault' or `Illegal<br />
     Operation' warning. We will be able to generate<br />
     significant revenue by including a short<br />
     advertising message along with it," said Microsoft<br />
     marketing director Nathan Mirror. He also<br />
     mentioned that Microsoft is intended to add banner<br />
     ads into its Blue Screen of Death in the near<br />
     future.<br />
<br />
     The Justice Department immediately<br />
     indicated that they intend to investigate whether<br />
     Microsoft is gaining an unfair advantage in<br />
     reaching the public with this advertising by<br />
     virtue of its semi-monopolistic control over error<br />
     messages.<br />

  As Papa did last-minute Internet shopping.<br />
<br />
  The stockings were hung by the modem with care<br />
  In hope that St. Nicholas would bring new software.<br />
  The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
  While visions of computer games danced in their heads.<br />
<br />
  PageMaker for Billy, and Quicken for Dan,<br />
  And Carmen Sandiego for Pamela Ann.<br />
  The letters to Santa had been sent out by Mom,<br />
  To santaclaus@toyshop.northpole.com -<br />
<br />
  Which has now been re-routed to Washington State<br />
  Because Santa's workshop has been bought by Bill Gates.<br />
  All the elves and reindeer have had to skedaddle<br />
  To flashy new quarters in suburban Seattle.<br />
<br />
  After centuries of a life that was simple and spare,<br />
  St. Nicholas is suddenly a new billionaire,<br />
  With a shiny red Porsche in the place of his sleigh,<br />
  And a house on Lake Washington that's just down the way<br />
  From where Bill has his mansion. The old fellow preens<br />
  In black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.<br />
  The elves have stock options and desks with a view,<br />
  Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue.<br />
<br />
  No more dolls or toy soldiers or little toy drums (ahem - pardon me)<br />
  No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drums<br />
  Will be under the tree, only compact disk ROMS<br />
  With the Microsoft label. So spin up your drive,<br />
  From now on Christmas runs only on Win95.<br />
<br />
  More rapid than eagles the competitors came,<br />
  And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.<br />
  "Now, ADOBE! now, CLARIS! now, INTUIT! too,<br />
  Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! you are all of you through,<br />
<br />
  It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,<br />
  It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist -<br />
  Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,<br />
  And on the package, a picture of Santa himself.<br />
<br />
  Get 'em young, keep 'em long, is Microsoft's scheme,<br />
  And a merger with Santa is a marketer's dream.<br />
  To the top of the NASDAQ! to the top of the Dow!<br />
  Now dash away! dash away! dash away - wow!"<br />
<br />
  And Mama in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,<br />
  Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br />
  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
  The whir and the hum of our satellite platter,<br />
  As it turned toward that new Christmas star in the sky,<br />
  The SANTALITE owned by the Microsoft guy.<br />
  As I sprang from my bed and was turning around,<br />
  My computer turned on with a Jingle-Bells sound.<br />
<br />
  And there on the screen was a smiling Bill Gates<br />
  Next to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.<br />
  And I heard them exclaim in voice so bright,<br />
  Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS, and TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
"As computers and the Internet grow more prevalent, employers <br />
increasingly are using software to monitor workers' computer use. <br />
Employers say such surveillance is needed to cut down on-line loafing, <br />
to protect companies from potentially illegal or improper computer <br />
activities by workers, and even just to determine whether there is any <br />
problem of computer misuse." -- The Boston Globe<br />
<br />
<br />
To: All Staff <br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
As many of you are aware, we have recently installed a new Net Snoop <br />
computer monitoring system to help us track employee Internet use. I <br />
want to assure you that we are using Net Snoop only to increase our <br />
productivity. While the system does allow me to view what is on your <br />
computer screen at all times, this in no way should be viewed as an <br />
invasion of privacy. It is merely an attempt to make our family here at <br />
Warburton's more successful than ever. <br />
<br />
To: Melissa March<br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
Congratulations on your recent Minesweeper score of 163. That is very <br />
impressive indeed. However, while conducting a test of our new Net <br />
Snoop system, I did notice that you might be playing too much <br />
Minesweeper at work. In fact, yesterday you played all day, with only a <br />
break for lunch and another break in which to write a short e-mail to <br />
Raoul in Accounting entitled "Thanks for last night, STUD!!!" An <br />
occasional game of Minesweeper is fine, but it would be best to play <br />
only during your break time. Thank you.  <br />
<br />
To: Max Travis<br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
It was a delight meeting your son yesterday. However, I did notice that <br />
while you were at a meeting, he surfed to some very frightening web <br />
sites. One was for a singer called Marilyn Manson and was, I must say, <br />
deeply unsettling. I don't mean to accuse you of bad parenting; I just <br />
thought I should inform you so that you may take the appropriate <br />
disciplinary action.<br />
<br />
To: George Pedersen<br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
While it is impressive that you have been able to download almost the <br />
entire Pamela Anderson video collection, I feel that this action is not at <br />
all appropriate in the workplace. From now on, Pedersen, please refrain <br />
from using company computers to view pornographic materials. Thank <br />
you.<br />
<br />
To Raoul Westerburg<br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
It seems that your excessive online chatting may be a problem. Many of <br />
your messages seem quite racy for the office setting, and I think it is <br />
important that everyone remains fully clothed at all times during the <br />
workday. Also, from a review of your e-mail, it is apparent that you are <br />
involved romantically with at least three women and possibly one man in <br />
our office. There is no policy against this, but I do think it is important <br />
that something like this does not get out of hand. We certainly do not <br />
want this office to turn into a soap opera, and I hope that this can all be <br />
resolved without a scene.  <br />
<br />
To: George Pedersen<br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
Pedersen, I believe I have already warned you against viewing offensive <br />
materials. This extends to the use of e-mail as well. I must say that your <br />
latest e-mail joke about the cow was not at all amusing and in fact deeply <br />
disturbing. As you should know, such an activity can be quite painful <br />
for a cow, and I do not believe it is right for us to laugh at its misfortune. <br />
Furthermore, sending this out to a large number of people from a <br />
Warburton's e-mail address is completely unacceptable. I hope this will <br />
not happen again.  <br />
<br />
To: Melissa March<br />
From: Charles Endicott<br />
<br />
Through Net Snoop, I was able to read several chapter of the new novel <br />
you are writing at work. I was very impressed, but I also feel that it would <br />
be best if you could refrain from writing this during work hours. Chapter <br />
Three, "Why Raoul is a two timing creep who deserves to die" was <br />
especially well written, though I am a little hurt by Chapter Six, "My boss <br />
is a big fat nosy bastard." If you are at all unhappy, I hope you will stop <br />
by my office so that we can discuss it. My door is always open. <br />
<br />
To: All Staff<br />
From:  Samuel Warburton<br />
<br />
It is with great regret that I have asked for the resignation of Charles <br />
Endicott. He was in the past a very effective manager, but, since the <br />
introduction of our Net Snoop system, Charles has been greatly <br />
neglecting his work. During the last several weeks, he has not been <br />
performing his normal tasks at all; instead, he has merely been sitting in <br />
his office all day spying on other employees. I have decided it would be <br />
best to look for a replacement. I appreciate all your hard work and I know <br />
that we will be able to continue at our normal level of success <br />
throughout the coming transition. Thank you.<br />

   </div><div>The NEW Microsoft Keyboard<br />
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Corporation has just announced a new PC keyboard designed<br />
specifically for Windows.  {Sources say a Macintosh variant is in the<br />
works.}  In addition to the keys found on the standard keyboard,<br />
Microsoft's new design adds several new keys which will make your<br />
Windows computing even more fun!  The final specs are not yet set,<br />
so please feel free to make suggestions.  The keys proposed so far <br />
are:<br />
<br />
1) GPF key -- This key will instantly generate a General Protection <br />
Fault when pressed.  Microsoft representatives state that the purpose <br />
of the GPF key is to save Windows users time by eliminating the need <br />
to run an application in order to produce a General Protection Fault.<br />
<br />
2) $$ key -- When this key is pressed, money is transferred <br />
automatically from your bank account to Microsoft without the need <br />
for further action or third party intervention.<br />
<br />
3) ZD key -- This key was developed specifically for reviewers of <br />
Microsoft products.  When pressed it inserts random superlative <br />
adjectives in any text which contains the words Microsoft or Windows <br />
within the file being edited.<br />
<br />
4) MS key -- This key runs a Microsoft commercial entitled "Computing <br />
for Mindless Drones" in a 1" x 1" window.<br />
<br />
5) FUD key -- Some thing to do with the display ... self explanatory.<br />
<br />
6) Chicago key -- Generates do nothing loops for months at a time.<br />
<br />
7) IBM key -- Searches your hard disk for operating systems or <br />
applications by vendors other than Microsoft and deletes them.  (Is <br />
very effective at removing Netscape).<br />
<br />
8) MSN Key -- With a single keystroke you will install and setup the <br />
world's second slowest web access (AOL takes first place).  And you <br />
thought it was tough deleting all of the SetupMSN files from Win 95! <br />
<br />
9) RW95 Key -- Stands for Re-install Windows 95.  Because it's <br />
usually a weekly ritual for most Win 95 users, why not make it <br />
easier?<br />
<br />
10) FDISK Key -- Microsoft's new compression utility gives you 100% <br />
data compression guaranteed.  Could stand for Format Disk, but we all <br />
know what it really stands for.<br />

<br />
<br />
Q: How can I choose what groups to post in?  ...<br />
Q: How about an example?<br />
<br />
A: Ok.  Let's say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from<br />
the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think<br />
rec.sport.hockey would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be<br />
interested.  This is a big trade!  Since it's a NEWS article, it<br />
belongs in the news.* hierarchy as well.  If you are a news admin, or<br />
there is one on your machine, try news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.<br />
<br />
The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.physics.  He<br />
is a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are<br />
also interested in stars.  Next, his name is Polish sounding.  So post<br />
to soc.culture.polish.  But that group doesn't exist, so cross-post to<br />
news.groups suggesting it should be created.  With this many groups of<br />
interest, your article will be quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre<br />
as well.  (And post to comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any<br />
articles there, and a "comp" group will propagate your article<br />
further.)<br />

            And all through the nation<br />
            We awaited The Bug,<br />
            The Millennium sensation.<br />
<br />
            The chips were replaced<br />
            In computers with care,<br />
            In hopes that ol' Bugsy<br />
            Wouldn't stop there.<br />
<br />
            While some folks could think<br />
            They were snug in their beds<br />
            Others had visions<br />
            Of dread in their heads.<br />
<br />
            And Ma with her PC,<br />
            And I with my Mac<br />
            Had just logged on the Net<br />
            And kicked back with a snack.<br />
<br />
            When over the server,<br />
            There arose such a clatter<br />
           I called Mister Gates<br />
            To see what was the matter.<br />
<br />
            But he was away,<br />
            So I flew like a flash<br />
            Off to my bank<br />
            To withdraw all my cash.<br />
<br />
            When what with my wandering eyes<br />
            Should I see?<br />
            My good old Mac<br />
            Looked sick to me.<br />
<br />
            The hack of all hackers<br />
            Was looking so smug,<br />
            I knew that it must be<br />
            The Y2K Bug<br />
<br />
            His image downloaded<br />
            In no time at all,<br />
            He whistled and shouted,<br />
            Let all systems fall<br />
<br />
            Go Intel Go Gateway<br />
            Now HP Big Blue<br />
            Everything Compaq,<br />
            And Pentium too<br />
<br />
            All processors big,<br />
            All processors small,<br />
            Crash away Crash away<br />
            Crash away all<br />
<br />
            All the controls<br />
            That planes need for their flights<br />
            All microwaves, trains<br />
            And all traffic lights.<br />
<br />
            As I drew in my breath<br />
            And was turning around,<br />
            Out through the modem,<br />
            He came with a bound.<br />
<br />
            He was covered with fur,<br />
            And slung on his back<br />
            Was a sackful of virus,<br />
            Set for attack.<br />
<br />
            His eyes-how they twinkled<br />
            His dimples-how merry<br />
            As midnight approached, though<br />
            Things soon became scary.<br />
<br />
            He had a broad little face<br />
            And a round little belly,<br />
            And his sack filled with virus<br />
            Quivered like jelly.<br />
<br />
            He was chubby and plump,<br />
            Perpetually grinning,<br />
            And I laughed when I saw him<br />
            Though my hard drive stopped spinning.<br />
<br />
            A wink of his eye,<br />
            And a twist of his head,<br />
            Soon gave me to know<br />
            A new feeling of dread.<br />
<br />
            He spoke not a word,<br />
            But went straight to his work,<br />
            He changed all the clocks,<br />
            Then turned with a jerk.<br />
<br />
            With a twitch of his nose,<br />
            And a quick little wink,<br />
            All things electronic<br />
            Soon went on the blink.<br />
<br />
            He zoomed from my system,<br />
            To the next folks on line,<br />
            He caused such a disruption,<br />
            Could this be a sign?<br />
<br />
            Then I heard him exclaim,<br />
            With a loud, hearty shout,<br />
            Happy Y2K to you all,<br />
            This is a helluva night<br />
<br />

  A guy calls tech support to report that his computer is faulty.<br />
  Tech: What's the problem?<br />
  User: There is smoke coming out of the power supply.<br />
  Tech: You'll need a new power supply.<br />
  User: No, I don't! I just need to change the startup files.<br />
  Tech: Sir, the power supply is faulty.  You'll need to replace it.<br />
  User: No way!  Someone told me that I just needed to change the startup<br />
      files and it will fix the problem!  All I need is for you to tell<br />
      me the command.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  10 minutes later, the User is still adamant that they are right.<br />
  The tech is frustrated and fed up.<br />
<br />
  Tech: Sorry, Sir.  We don't normally tell our customers this, but there<br />
      is an undocumented DOS command that will fix the problem.<br />
  User: I knew it!<br />
  Tech: Just add the line  LOAD NOSMOKE.COM  at the end of the CONFIG.SYS.<br />
      Let me know how it goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  10 minutes later.<br />
<br />
  User: It didn't work.  The power supply is still smoking.<br />
  Tech: Well, what version of DOS are you using?<br />
  User: MS-DOS 6.22.<br />
  Tech: That's your problem there.  That version of DOS didn't come<br />
      with NOSMOKE.  Contact Microsoft and ask them for a patch that<br />
      will give you the file.  Let me know how it goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  1 hour later.<br />
<br />
  User: I need a new power supply.<br />
  Tech: How did you come to that conclusion?<br />
  User: Well, I called Microsoft and told him about what your said,<br />
      and he started asking questions about the make of power supply.<br />
  Tech: Then what did he say?<br />
  User: He told me that my power supply isn't compatible with NOSMOKE.<br />

The Programmers of Chelm<br />
A Tale So Good You Could Plotz<br />
<br />
by Lincoln Spector<br />
<br />
<br />
In Yiddish folklore, the village of Chelm is renowned as a town of fools<br />
-- a place where wisdom, learning, and inspiration need never be hampered<br />
by common sense. The people of Chelm can, therefore, be considered the<br />
spiritual ancestors of all software designers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One day, the programmers of Chelm decided to write a new database for the<br />
synagogue. "It must keep track of every family in Chelm," pointed out<br />
Shmul, who liked to think of himself as the project leader. "We need to<br />
know who's married to who, who are their children, and every first and<br />
second cousin."<br />
<br />
"I see," said Mendel. "It must be a relational database."<br />
<br />
"But who should we relate to who?" asked Moshe.<br />
<br />
"Well, I certainly don't want my son marrying your daughter," objected Avram.<br />
<br />
"Gentlemen, gentlemen," called out Shmul, "let's remember what we're here<br />
for. Now I say we need a table for men, a table for women, a table for<br />
families, and a table for children."<br />
<br />
"Does the rabbi get his own table?" asked Avram. Everyone agreed that he<br />
should, as he was wise.<br />
<br />
"What about the user interface?" asked Moshe.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Shmul. "There should definitely be one," he said.<br />
"Otherwise, who would use it?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, but should it have a speedbar, smart icons, or a floating toolbar?<br />
And what kind of help should it have?"<br />
<br />
"Does it need help?" asked Mendel. "Does not the Talmud say that we should<br />
study? Let us write documentation that scholars can pore over and discuss<br />
at length."<br />
<br />
But Moshe still wasn't satisfied. "What happens if Yussel and Shandel have<br />
another baby? How does Mordcha, the rabbi's best student, make note of<br />
that?"<br />
<br />
"Everyone knows what he does," answered Avram. "He writes it down on a<br />
piece of paper."<br />
<br />
"Which he then uses to wrap fish," added Mendel.<br />
<br />
"Yes, but what will he do when our system is complete?" Everyone agreed<br />
this was a very good question.<br />
<br />
It didn't take Shmul long to come up with an answer. "He'll turn on his<br />
computer, enter our database, and type in the name of the new baby."<br />
<br />
"But how will the database know that Yussel and Shandel are the parents?"<br />
<br />
"Don't be ridiculous," said Avram. "Chelm is a small village. Everyone<br />
knows everyone else. When there's a new baby, how can someone not know the<br />
parents?"<br />
<br />
"How do people know?" asked Mendel.<br />
<br />
"That's easy," Avram answered. "Before the baby is born, they can tell by<br />
looking at the father. Why can't our program do the same?"<br />
<br />
"Because a computer doesn't have eyes."<br />
<br />
"Ah!" cried Shmul. "The computer doesn't have eyes, but Mordcha does, and<br />
Mordcha can tell the computer everything he sees. And if he says `Yussel<br />
looks very happy' one day, and `There's a new baby in town' on the next,<br />
the program will figure it out."<br />
<br />
Mendel considered this. "Perhaps, but I don't like depending on Mordcha<br />
telling the computer everything he sees. If he forgets to tell the computer<br />
that he saw the rabbi eat, will the program think it's Yom Kippur? It would<br />
be better if we write a query routine that will help Mordcha find a family.<br />
After all, are we not programmers? Mordcha could run the query from the<br />
main menu, and that will bring him to a view of Yussel and Shandel's<br />
family."<br />
<br />
"Will he be able to enter a new baby from this view?" asked Moshe.<br />
<br />
"Of course not!" said Mendel. "For that, he'd need to go to the New Baby<br />
form, which he can get to from the main menu. So after he's executed a<br />
query and found Yussel and Shandel, he can click a button to go back to the<br />
main menu. From there, he can go to any part of the database he wants."<br />
<br />
Moshe, however, suspected a fatal flaw. "But if he leaves the query and<br />
goes back to the main menu, how will the computer know the new baby belongs<br />
to Yussel and Shandel?"<br />
<br />
This question so greatly troubled the programmers of Chelm that Avram was<br />
moved to ask, "Does Maimonides say anything about this?"<br />
<br />
"Ach," cried Moshe. "Who cares about Maimonides? He used COBOL!"<br />
<br />
Just then Shmul found the solution. "It's simplicity itself! We'll put a<br />
button on the New Baby form that will let Mordcha do a query on the family<br />
table. When he finds Yussel and Shandel, he can press the button that will<br />
bring him back to the main menu and from there, return to the New Baby<br />
form."<br />
<br />
"That's brilliant!" cried Moshe. Then he thought about it. "But when he<br />
goes back to the New Baby form, will the computer know that Yussel and<br />
Shandel are the parents?"<br />
<br />
"Of course not. But he can always push the query button again."<br />
<br />
Moshe wasn't too sure. "What if he doesn't like being part of an infinite loop?"<br />
<br />
"Loop, schmoop. He's studying to be a rabbi, isn't he? He needs to learn<br />
about the infinite."<br />
<br />
"I have a better idea," interjected Moshe. "We can simply make all the new<br />
babies belong to Yussel and Shandel."<br />
<br />
The programmers all agreed this was the best plan yet. They were<br />
congratulating themselves when Avram had a thought. "Oy vey! There's<br />
something we overlooked. What will Mordcha wrap his fish in?"<br />
<br />
Moshe laughed. "But that's so simple. We'll add an option for him to print<br />
a special report."<br />

   </div><div>Warning: This list may be offensive to ardent feminists (ducking)<br />
<br />
by: Daniel J. Salomon Department of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada<br />
<br />
There are so many programming languages available that it can be very difficult to get to know them all well enough to pick the right one for you. On the other hand most men know what kind of woman appeals to them. So here is a handy guide for many of the popular programming languages that describes what kind of women they would be if programming languages were women.<br />
<br />
Assembler--A female track star who holds all the world speed records. She is hard and bumpy, and so is not that pleasant to embrace. She can cook up any meal, but needs a complete and detailed recipe. She is not beautiful or educated, and speaks in monosyllables like "MOV, JUMP, INC." She has a fierce and violent temper that make her the choice of last resort.<br />
<br />
FORTRAN--Your grey-haired grandmother. People make fun of her just because she is old, but if you take the time to listen, you can learn from her experiences and her mistakes. During her lifetime she has acquired many useful skills in sewing and cooking (subroutine libraries). That no younger women can match, so be thankful she is still around. She has a notoriously bad temper and when angered will start yelling and throwing dishes. It was mostly her bad temper that made grandad search for another wife.<br />
<br />
COBOL--A plump secretary. She talks far too much, and most of what she says can be ignored. She works hard and long hours, but can't handle really complicated jobs. She has a short and unpredictable temper, so no one really likes working with her. She can cook meals for a huge family, but only knows bland recipes.<br />
<br />
BASIC--The horny divorcee that lives next door. Her specialty is seducing young boys and it seems she is always readily available for them. She teaches them many amazing things, or at least they seem amazing because it is their first experience. She is not that young herself, but because she was their first lover the boys always remember her fondly. Her cooking and sewing skills are mediocre, but largely irrelevant, it's the frolicking that the boys like. The opinion that adults have of Mrs. BASIC is varied. Shockingly, some fathers actually introduce their own sons to this immoral woman! But generally the more righteous adults try to correct the badly influenced young men by introducing them to well behaved women like Miss Pascal.<br />
<br />
PL/I--A bordello madam. She wears silk dresses, diamonds, furs and red high heels. At one time she seemed very attractive, but now she just seems overweight and tacky. Tastes change.<br />
<br />
C--A lady executive. An avid jogger, very healthy, and not too talkative. Is an good cook if you like spicy food. Unless you double check everything you say (through LINT) you can unleash her fierce temper. Her daughter C++ is still quite young and prone to tantrums, but it seems that she will grow up into a fine young woman of milder temper and more sophisticated character.<br />
<br />
ALGOL 60--Your father's wartime sweetheart, petite, well proportioned, and sweet tempered. She disappeared mysteriously during the war, but your dad still talks about her shapely form and their steamy romance. He never actually tasted much of her cooking.<br />
<br />
Pascal--A grammar school teacher, and Algol 60's younger sister. Like her sister she is petite and attractive, but very bossy. She is a good cook but only if the recipe requires no more than one pot (module).<br />
<br />
Modula II--A high-school teacher and Pascal's daughter. Very much like her mother, but she has learned to cook with more than one pot.<br />
<br />
ALGOL 68--Algol 60's niece. A high-society woman, well educated and terse. Few men can fully understand her when she talks, and her former lovers still discuss her mysterious personality. She is very choosy about her romances and won't take just any man as her lover. She hasn't been seen lately, and rumor has it that she died in a fall from an ivory tower.<br />
<br />
LISP--She is an aging beatnik, who lives in a rural commune with her hippie cousins SMALLTALK and FORTH. Many men (mostly college students) who have visited the farmhouse enthusiastically praise the natural food, and perpetual love-ins that take place there. Others criticize the long cooking times, and the abnormal sexual postures (prefix and postfix). Although these women seldom have full-time jobs, when they do work, their employers praise them for their imagination, but usually not for their efficiency.<br />
<br />
APL--A fancy caterer specializing in Greek food. She can cook delicious meals for rows and rows of tables with dozens of people at each table. She doesn't talk much, as that would just slow her work down. Few people can understand her recipes, since they are in a foreign language, and are all recorded in mirror writing.<br />
<br />
LOGO--A grade-school art teacher. She is just the kind of teacher that you wish you had when you were young. She is shapely and patient, but not an interesting conversationalist. She can cook up delicious kiddie snacks, but not full-course meals.<br />
<br />
LUCID &amp; PROLOG--These clever teenagers show a new kind of cooking skill. They can cook-up fine meals without the use of recipes, working solely from a description of the desired meal (declarative cooking). Many men are fascinated by this and have already proposed marriage. Others complain that the girls work very slowly, and that often the description of the meal must be just as long as a recipe would be. It is hard to predict what these girls will be like when they are fully mature.<br />
<br />
Ada--A WAC colonel built like an amazon. She is always setting strict rules, but if you follow them, she keeps her temper. She is quite talkative, always spouting army regulations, and using obscure military talk. You gotta love her though, because the army says so. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
	A computer was something on TV <br />
	from a science fiction show, <br />
	A window was something you hated to clean... <br />
	and Ram was the cousin of a goat.. <br />
	A byte was something you took when you ate, <br />
	Meg was the name of my honey.... <br />
	Hardware was used to lock a door... <br />
	Gig was a muscian's job for money. <br />
	An application was for employment, <br />
	A program was a TV show.... <br />
	A cursor used profanity, <br />
	A keyboard was a piano..... <br />
	Compress was something you did to garbage, <br />
	Not something you did to a file... <br />
	And if you unzipped anything in public <br />
	You'd be in jail for a while. <br />
	Log on was adding wood to a fire, <br />
	Hard drive was a long trip on the road. <br />
	A mouse pad was where a mouse lived.... <br />
	A backup happened to your commode.<br />
	Cut you did with a pocket knife, <br />
	Paste you did with glue.... <br />
	A web was a spider's home <br />
	And a virus was the flu. <br />
	I guess I'll stick to my pad and paper <br />
	and the memory in my head.... <br />
	I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash... <br />
	But when it happens they'll wish they were dead.... <br />

   </div><div>Restaurant Y2K<br />
<br />
You own a restaurant - a really fancy, big-name restaurant. You make boodles of money, because famous people come eat at your restaurant, the word gets around... besides, you trained at one of those big fancy French schools for cooks, so you've paid your dues. And you're Greek, that helps....<br />
<br />
Now, being a big fancy restaurant, you've got lots of bills to pay; food stocks, payroll, utility bills, and of course insurance. Big bill, that damn insurance, because being a big fancy restaurant, everyone and their mother sues you every time they trip over the edge of a rug, or burn their arm reaching over the candle on the table, or (glub forbid) wind up with food poisoning.<br />
<br />
But your insurance company pays.... they'd rather negotiate on those nuisance<br />
lawsuits than spend the time, and money, in court. Of course, your bill keeps<br />
going up and up, and up.... But hey, that's one of the costs of doing business,<br />
and being a big fancy restaurant, you understand and live with it.<br />
<br />
Now, you receive a letter from your insurance company, explaining a new wrinkle<br />
in the process. You check around, and all your other friends who own their own<br />
big fancy restaurants, and even the ones with smaller joints, have received similar letters.  The insurance companies are explaining, in advance, about a claim that they will NOT be paying, so don't even bother sending it in. They expect many restaurants, at the end of the year, will be experiencing a problem with their walk-in refrigerator and freezer units, and they will not be responsible for the spoilage due to this problem.<br />
<br />
See where this is going yet?<br />
<br />
That's right folks, the insurance companies have been warning them since summer<br />
that they will not be responsible when and if the Y2K problem hits the major<br />
utilities, and power-outages become more common than cockroaches behind the stove.... well, not THIS stove, of course, because this is a big fancy restaurant..... <br />
<br />
Now, I don't really have too much of a problem with this... they gave them over<br />
6 months to get some kind of backup system on line, i.e. a generator or a couple tons of ice - whatever, your choice, just make sure it works... makes good business sense, for both parties.<br />
<br />
I heard this from a relative who helps out at the big fancy restaurant from<br />
time-to-time, so I can't really verify the accuracy of his statement.... but he said the insurance companies were declaring the Y2K problem AN ACT OF GOD!!!!<br />

<br />
<br />
 1.0:<br />
      Also known as "one point uh-oh", or "barely out of beta". We had to<br />
      release because the lab guys had reached a point of exhaustion and <br />
      the marketing guys were in a cold sweat of terror.<br />
<br />
 1.1: <br />
      We fixed all the killer bugs ... <br />
<br />
 1.2: <br />
      Uh, we introduced a few new bugs fixing the killer bugs and so we <br />
      had to fix them, too. <br />
<br />
 2.0: <br />
      We did the product we really wanted to do to begin with. Mind you, <br />
      it's really not what the customer needs yet, but we're working on it. <br />
<br />
 2.1: <br />
      Well, not surprisingly, we broke some things in making major changes <br />
      so we had to fix them. But we did a really good job of testing this <br />
      time, so we don't think we introduced any new bugs while we were <br />
      fixing these bugs. <br />
<br />
 2.2: <br />
      Uh, sorry, one slipped through. One lousy typo error and you won't<br />
      believe how much trouble it caused! <br />
<br />
 2.3: <br />
      Some jerk found a deep-seated bug that's been there since 1.0 and <br />
      wouldn't stop nagging until we fixed it!! <br />
<br />
 3.0: <br />
      Hey, we finally think we've got it right! Most of the customers are<br />
      really happy with this. <br />
<br />
 3.1: <br />
      Of course, we did break a few little things. <br />
<br />
 4.0: <br />
      More features. It's doubled in size now, by the way, and you'll need <br />
      to get more memory and a faster processor ... <br />

           What seems to be the problem?<br />
<br />

<br />
   Waiter: Maybe it's the way you're using the soup;<br />
           try eating it with a fork instead.<br />
<br />
   Patron: Even when I use the fork, the fly is still there.<br />

          what kind of bowl are  you using?<br />
<br />
   Patron: A SOUP bowl!<br />
<br />
   Waiter: Hmmm, that should work.  Maybe it's a configuration<br />
           problem; how was the bowl set up?<br />
<br />
   Patron: You brought it to me on a saucer; what has that to<br />
           do with the fly in my soup?!<br />
<br />
   Waiter: Can you remember everything you did before you<br />
           noticed the fly in your soup?<br />
<br />
   Patron: I sat down and ordered the Soup of the Day!<br />

<br />
   WORF: Captain, there are three Romulan warships uncloaking dead ahead.<br />
   PICARD: On screen. [The main viewing screen changes to a pattern of<br />
   horizontal lines, each only a single pixel wide.]<br />
   PICARD: Data, what's wrong here?<br />
   DATA: Captain, the main viewscreen does not have sufficient video<br />
   memory to display an image of this size. May I suggest that you select<br />
   a lower resolution?<br />
   PICARD: Make it so. [The screen blanks, and then an image appears,<br />
   with big, blocky square pixels. Three objects appear in the center,<br />
   which could be Romulan warbirds, but which actually look more like the<br />
   aliens in Space Invaders.]<br />
   PICARD: Data, open a hailing channel to the Romulans.<br />
   DATA: Aye, sir. [Data picks up an hourglass from the floor beside him,<br />
   turns it over, and places it on the console in front of him. He<br />
   punches some buttons on the console and sits motionless for several<br />
   seconds. A flash of light blossoms from one of the Romulan ships on<br />
   the viewscreen.]<br />
   WORF: Incoming plasma torpedo, Captain!<br />
   PICARD: Shields up!<br />
   DATA: I'm sorry, Captain, but I am still attempting to complete your<br />
   last instruction. I must ask you to wait until I have finished before<br />
   you issue your next command.<br />
   PICARD: What on earth do you mean? Data, this is *important*! I want<br />
   those shields up *right now.*<br />
   DATA: I'm sorry, Captain, but I am still attempting to complete your<br />
   last instruction. I must ask you to wait until I have finished before<br />
   you issue your next command.<br />
   LAFORGE: Allow me, captain. [to Data] Control-alt-delete, Data. [Data<br />
   removes the hourglass from the console, and returns it to the floor.]<br />
   DATA: The Romulans are not responding to my hails. Press my nose to<br />
   cancel and return to Windows. Pull my left ear to close this<br />
   communications channel which is not responding. You will lose any<br />
   information sent by the Romulans. [LaForge pulls Data's left ear.]<br />
   PICARD: Shields... [There is a tremendous explosion. The bridge shakes<br />
   violently, and all the crew members are thrown to the floor. A shower<br />
   of sparks erupts from Wesley Crusher's station at the helm, throwing<br />
   Wesley back away from the console.]<br />
   PICARD: Up, Data!<br />
   DATA: Aye, sir.<br />
   RIKER: All decks, damage report!<br />
   WORF: Captain, Ensign Crusher is injured. He appears to be<br />
   unconscious. [Data picks up the hourglass again, places it on his<br />
   console, and punches some more buttons. He waits a few seconds, then<br />
   puts the hourglass back on the floor.]<br />
   DATA: Shields are now up, captain.<br />
   PICARD: And not a moment too soon. Worf, lock all phasers on the lead<br />
   Romulan ship.<br />
   WORF: Aye, sir. [He punches buttons on the weapons console.]<br />
   PICARD: Mr. Data, take the helm, and prepare for evasive action.<br />
   DATA: I am sorry, sir, but I do not have the proper device driver<br />
   installed for that console.<br />
   PICARD: Well, damn it, install the right one.<br />
   DATA: Please insert Setup Implant #1 in my right nostril.<br />
   PICARD: Number One, where do we keep Data's setup implants?<br />
   RIKER: I left them with Geordi.<br />
   LAFORGE: What!!? I thought you still had them!<br />
   PICARD: Data, don't you have device drivers stored in your internal<br />
   memory?<br />
   DATA: Not found, sir. Please insert Setup Implant #1 in my right<br />
   nostril.<br />
   PICARD: Data, I don't *have* Setup Implant #1.<br />
   DATA: Not ready reading right nostril. Abort, Retry, Fail?<br />
   PICARD: Abort!<br />
   DATA: Not ready reading right nostril. Abort, Retry, Fail?<br />
   PICARD: Well, fail, then!<br />
   DATA: Current nose is no longer valid. [Data walks over to the helm,<br />
   and presses several buttons. The ship lurches, the images of the<br />
   Romulan warships suddenly shift to one side of the viewscreen, and a<br />
   high-pitched whining noise is heard coming from somewhere else in the<br />
   ship.]<br />
   LAFORGE: [alarmed] Data, what the hell are you doing?<br />
   PICARD: Number One, do we have a customer service number for Data?<br />
   RIKER: Yes sir, but last time I tried to call them, I got put on hold<br />
   for two hours before I was able to talk to anyone. And that person<br />
   wasn't knowledgeable about androids of Data's model. She specialized<br />
   in industrial control robots. [Suddenly, the lights all go out, the<br />
   viewscreen goes blank, and all the usual noise of fans, motors, and so<br />
   on whines to a halt. After a few seconds, the red emergency lights<br />
   come on. Data is standing by the console, absolutely motionless.]<br />
   PICARD: What's going on?<br />
   LAFORGE: [checking the helm console] Lieutenant Data has caused a<br />
   General Protection Violation in the warp engine core.<br />
   PICARD: These androids look really sharp, but you can't really do<br />
   anything with them. [The shimmer of the transporter effect appears,<br />
   and six Romulans in full battle dress materialize on the bridge. A<br />
   seventh figure, a Ferengi, appears moments later.]<br />
   FERENGI: [with a mercenary grin] Can I interest you in a Macintosh,<br />
   Captain?<br />

   </div><div><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wed, 4 Sep 1996<br />
Mountain View, CA -- Sun Microsystems today filed a trademark<br />
infringement against the island of Java over the use of Sun's<br />
Java trademark.<br />
<br />
Responding to criticism that the island has been called Java for<br />
centuries, Sun lawyer Frank Cheatham said "Yeah, and in all that<br />
time they never filed for a trademark. They deserve to lose the<br />
name."<br />
<br />
Rather than pay the licensing fee, the island decided to change<br />
its name. They originally voted to change it to Visu Albasic, but<br />
an angry telegram from Redmond, Washington convinced them otherwise.<br />
The country finally settled on a symbol for a name -- a neatly-colored<br />
coffee cup which still evokes the idea of java. Since most<br />
newspapers and magazines will not be able to print the name of the<br />
island, it will hereafter be referred to in print as "The Island<br />
Formerly Known As Java".<br />
<br />
The Island Formerly Known As Java bills itself as a cross-landmass<br />
island, but so far has only been implemented in production on the<br />
Malay Archipelago. Africa is been rumored to have implemented it<br />
on Madagascar, but it is still in alpha testing.<br />
<br />
Lawyers from Sun would also like to locate the owners of the huge<br />
fiery ball at the center of the solar system. They have some legal<br />
papers for them..<br />

   </div><div>Technical Support Recipe: Butter Your Disk Drive<br />
<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "I got this problem.  You people sent me this install disk, <br />
		and now my A drive won't work."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Your A drive won't work?"<br />
	<br />
	Customer:  "That's what I said.  You sent me a bad disk, it got stuck in <br />
		my drive, now it won't work at all."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Did it not install properly?  What kind of error<br />
		messages did you get?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "I didn't get any error message.  The disk got stuck in the drive <br />
		and wouldn't come out.  So I got these pliers and tried to get it <br />
		out and that didn't work either."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "You did what sir?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "I got these pliers, and tried to get the disk out, but it <br />
		wouldn't budge.  I just ended up cracking the plastic stuff a bit."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "I don't understand sir, did you push the eject button?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "No, so then I got a stick of butter and melted it and used a <br />
		turkey baster and put the butter in the drive, around the disk, and <br />
		that got it loose.  Then I used the pliers and it came out fine.  I <br />
		can't believe you would send me a disk that was broke and defective."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Let me get this clear.  You put melted butter in your A drive <br />
		and used pliers to pull the disk out?"<br />
<br />
	( At this point, I put the call on the speaker phone and motioned at the <br />
	other techs to listen in.)<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Just so I am absolutely clear on this, can you repeat what <br />
		you just said?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "I said I put butter in my A drive to get your crappy disk out, <br />
		then I had to use pliers to pull it out."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Did you push that little button that was sticking out when <br />
		the disk was in the drive, you know, the thing called the disk eject <br />
		button?"<br />
<br />
	( Silence. )<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Sir?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "Yes."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Sir, did you push the eject button?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "No, but you people are going to fix my computer, or I am going <br />
		to sue you for breaking my computer!"<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Let me get this straight.  You are going to sue our company <br />
		because you put the disk in the A drive, didn't follow the <br />
		instructions we sent you, didn't actually seek professional advice, <br />
		didn't consult your user's manual on how to use your computer <br />
		properly, but instead proceeded to pour butter into the drive and <br />
		physically rip the disk out?"<br />
<br />
	Customer:  "Ummmm."<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "Do you really think you stand a chance, since we do record <br />
		every call and have it on tape?"<br />
<br />
	Customer: ( now rather humbled ) "But you're supposed to help!"<br />
<br />
	Tech Support:  "I am sorry sir, but there is nothing we can do for you.  <br />
		Have a nice day!"<br />

<br />
<br />
Austin, Texas,<br />
<br />
<br />
An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get<br />
her new Dell Computer to turn on.  After ensuring the computer was<br />
plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed<br />
the power button.  Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot<br />
pedal and nothing happens."  The "foot pedal" turned out to be the<br />
computer's mouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her<br />
brand-new computer wouldn't work.  She said she unpacked the unit,<br />
plugged it in, and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something<br />
to happen.  When asked what happened when she pressed the power<br />
switch, she asked "What power switch?"<br />
<br />
<br />
Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to<br />
"Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the<br />
"Any" key is.<br />
<br />
<br />
AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse<br />
was hard to control with the dust cover on.  The cover turned out<br />
to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining<br />
that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old<br />
diskettes.  After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to<br />
diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer labeled the<br />
diskettes then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective<br />
diskettes.  A few days later a letter arrived from the customer<br />
along with Xeroxed copies of the floppies.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled<br />
floppy back in the drive and close the door.  The customer asked<br />
the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up<br />
and crossing the room to close the door to his room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer<br />
to fax anything.  After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the<br />
technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper<br />
by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the "send"<br />
key.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so a<br />
Dell tech referred him to the local Egghead.  "Yeah, I got me a<br />
couple of friends," the customer replied.  When told Egghead was a<br />
software store, the man said, "Oh, I thought you meant for me to find a<br />
couple of geeks."<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard<br />
no longer worked.  He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with<br />
soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all<br />
the keys and washing them individually.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was<br />
enraged because his computer had told him he was "bad and an<br />
invalid". The tech explained that the computer's "bad command" and "invalid"<br />
responses shouldn't be taken personally.<br />

In opening the session, NarayanaMurthy(Infosys)<br />
mentioned a<br />
hypothetical situation where 20 executives<br />
board an airplane and are told that the<br />
flight that they are about to take is the<br />
first-ever to feature pilotless technology:<br />
<br />
It is an uncrewed aircraft.<br />
<br />
Each one of the CEOs is then told, privately,<br />
that their company's software is running<br />
the aircraft's automatic pilot system.<br />
<br />
Nineteen of the CEOs promptly leave the aircraft,<br />
each offering a different type of excuse.<br />
<br />
One CEO alone remains on board the jet, seeming<br />
very calm indeed. Asked why he is so confident in this<br />
first uncrewed flight, he replies: "If it's the<br />
same software that runs my company's IT systems,<br />
this plane won't even take off."<br />

   </div><div>   One day, Jeffrey complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts, I<br />
   guess I should see a doctor."<br />
<br />
   "Don't do that! There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose<br />
   anything, quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply put in a sample of<br />
   your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you<br />
   what you can do about it. It only costs $10."<br />
<br />
   Jeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to<br />
   the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and<br />
   deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and<br />
   various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a<br />
   small slip of paper on which was printed:<br />
<br />
     "You have tennis elbow.<br />
     Soak your arm in warm water.<br />
     Avoid heavy lifting.<br />
     It will be better in two weeks."<br />
<br />
       Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology<br />
   was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to<br />
   wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try.<br />
   He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and<br />
   urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he<br />
   masturbated into the concoction.<br />
<br />
       He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the<br />
   sample and deposited $10.00. The computer again made the usual noise<br />
   and printed out the following message:<br />
<br />
     "Your tap water is too hard.<br />
     Get a water softener.<br />
     Your dog has worms.<br />
     Get him vitamins.<br />
     Your daughter's using cocaine.<br />
     Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.<br />
     Your wife's pregnant - twin girls.<br />
     They aren't yours.<br />
     Get a lawyer.<br />
<br />
     And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get<br />
     better."<br />

   </div><div>A man was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, ?If you kiss me, I?ll turn into a beautiful princess.? He bent over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket.<br />
<br />
The frog spoke up again and said, ?If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will tell everyone how smart and brave you are and how you are my hero? The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket.<br />
<br />
The frog spoke up again and said, ?If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will be your loving companion for an entire week.? The man took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it, and returned it to his pocket.<br />
<br />
The frog then cried out, ?If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I?ll stay with you for a year and do ANYTHING you want.? Again the man took the frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his pocket.<br />
<br />
Finally, the frog asked, ?What is the matter?  I?ve told you I?m a beautiful princess, that I?ll stay with you for a year and do anything you want. Why won?t you kiss me??<br />
<br />
The man said, ?Look, I?m a computer programmer. I don?t have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog is cool.?<br />

THE HACKER TEST - Version 1.0<br />
 <br />
Preface:  06.16.89<br />
 <br />
This test was conceived and written by Felix Lee, John Hayes and Angela<br />
Thomas at the end of the spring semester, 1989.  It has gone through<br />
many revisions prior to this initial release, and will undoubtedly go<br />
through many more.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
(Herewith a compendium of fact and folklore about computer hackerdom,<br />
cunningly disguised as a test.)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Scoring - Count 1 for each item that you have done, or each<br />
question that you can answer correctly.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
If you score is between:                    You are<br />
 <br />
0x000 and 0x010       ->         Computer Illiterate<br />
0x011 and 0x040       ->         a User<br />
0x041 and 0x080       ->         an Operator<br />
0x081 and 0x0C0       ->         a Nerd<br />
0x0C1 and 0x100       ->         a Hacker<br />
0x101 and 0x180       ->         a Guru<br />
0x181 and 0x200       ->         a Wizard<br />
 <br />
Note: If you don't understand the scoring, stop here.<br />

   </div><div>The Internet Explained<br />
By Dave Barry<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What, exactly, is the Internet?<br />
A. The Internet is a worldwide network of university, government, <br />
   	business, and private computer systems.<br />
<br />
Q. Who runs it?<br />
A. A 13-year-old named Jason.<br />
<br />
Q. How can I get on the Internet?<br />
A. The easiest way is to sign up with one of the popular commercial<br />
	"on-line" services, such as Prodigy, CompuServe, or America <br />
	Online, which will give you their program disks for free. Or, <br />
	if you just leave your house unlocked, they'll sneak in some <br />
	night and install their programs on your computer when you're <br />
	sleeping. They really want your business.<br />
<br />
Q. What are the benefits of these services? <br />
A. The major benefit is that they all have simple, "user-friendly" <br />
	interfaces that enable you-even if you have no previous <br />
	computer experience-to provide the on-line services with the <br />
	information they need to automatically put monthly charges on <br />
	your credit card bill forever. <br />
<br />
Q. What if I die?<br />
A. They don't care.<br />
<br />
Q. Can't I cancel my account?<br />
A. Of course! You can cancel your account at anytime. <br />
<br />
Q. How?<br />
A. Nobody has ever been able to find out. Some of us have been trying <br />
	for ears to cancel our on-line service accounts, but no matter <br />
	what we do,  the charges keep appearing on our bills. We're <br />
	thinking of entering the Federal Witness Protection Program.<br />
<br />
Q. What if I have children?<br />
A. You'll want an anesthetic, because it really hurts. <br />
<br />
Q. No, I mean: What if my children also use my Internet account? <br />
A. You should just sign your house and major internal organs over to <br />
   	the on-line service right now.<br />
<br />
Q. Aside from running up charges, what else can I do once I'm connected <br />
   	to an on-line service?<br />
A. Millions of things! An incredible array of things! No end of things! <br />
<br />
Q. Like what?<br />
A. You can ... ummmm ... OK! I have one! You can chat. <br />
<br />
Q. Chat?<br />
A. Chat.<br />
<br />
Q. I can already chat. I chat with my friends. <br />
A. Yes, but on the Internet, which connects millions of people all over <br />
	the entire globe, you can chat with total strangers, many of <br />
	whom are boring and stupid!<br />
<br />
Q. Sounds great! How does it work?<br />
A. Well, first you decide which type of area you wish to chat in. Some <br />
	areas are just for general chatting, and some are for specific <br />
	interest groups, such as Teens, Poets, Cat Lovers, Religious <br />
	People, Gays, Gay Teens Who Read Religious Poetry to Cats, and <br />
	of course Guys Having Pointless Arguments About Sports. At any <br />
	given moment, an area can contain anywhere from two to dozens <br />
	of people, who use clever fake names such as "ByteMe2" so <br />
	nobody will know their real identities. <br />
<br />
Q. What are their real identities?<br />
A. They represent an incredible range of people, people of all ages, in <br />
	all kinds of fascinating fields from scientists to singers, <br />
	from writers to wranglers, from actors to athletes - you could <br />
	be talking to almost anybody on the Internet!<br />
<br />
Q. Really?<br />
A. No. You re almost always talking to losers and hormone-crazed <br />
	13-year-old boys. But they pretend to be writers, wranglers, <br />
	scientists, singers, etc.<br />
<br />
Q. What do people talk about in chat areas? A. Most chat-area discussions revolve around the fascinating topic of who is entering and leaving the chat area. A secondary, but equally fascinating, topic is where everybody lives. Also, for a change of pace, every now and then the discussion is interrupted by a hormone-crazed 13-year-old boy wishing to talk dirty to women. To give you an idea of how scintillating the repartee can be, here's a re-creation of a typical chat area dialogue (do not read this scintillating repartee while operating heavy machinery):<br />
<br />
LilBrisket: Hi everybody<br />
Wazootyman: Hi LilBrisket<br />
Toadster:   Hi Bris<br />
Lungftook:  Hi B<br />
LilBrisket: What's going on?<br />
Toadster:   Not much<br />
Lungftook:  Pretty quiet<br />
<br />
(LONGISH PAUSE)<br />
<br />
Wazootyman: Anybody here from Texas?<br />
LilBrisket: No<br />
Toadster:   Nope<br />
Lungftook:  Sorry<br />
<br />
(LONGISH PAUSE)<br />
<br />
UvulaBob:   Hi everybody<br />
Toadster:   Hi UvulaBob<br />
Lungftook:  Hi Uvula<br />
LilBrisket: Hi UB<br />
Wazootyman: Hi U<br />
UvulaBob:   What's happening?<br />
LilBrisket: Kinda slow<br />
Toadster:   Same old same old<br />
Lungflook:  Pretty quiet<br />
Jason56243837: LilBrisket, take off your panties <br />
LilBrisket: OK, but I'm a man<br />
<br />
(LONGISH PAUSE)<br />
<br />
Wazootyman: UvulaBob, are you from Texas? <br />
UvulaBob:    No.<br />
<br />
(LONGISH PAUSE)<br />
<br />
Lungftook:  Well, gotta run.<br />
Toadster.- 'bye, Lungflook<br />
LilBrisket: Take 'er easy, Lungster<br />
Wazootyman: See ya around, Lung<br />
UvulaBob:   So long, L<br />
<br />
(LONGISH PAUSE)<br />
<br />
PolypMaster: Hi everybody<br />
LilBrisket:  Hey, PolypMaster<br />
Toadster:    Yo, Polyp<br />
UvulaBob:    Hi, P<br />
PolypMaster: What's going on?<br />
LilBrisket:  Not much<br />
Toadster:    Pretty quiet<br />
UvulaBob:    Kinda slow ...<br />
<br />
And so it goes in the chat areas, hour after riveting hour, where the <br />
ideas flow fast and furious, and at any moment you could learn some <br />
fascinating nugget of global-network information, such as whether or <br />
not PolypMaster comes from Texas.<br />
<br />
Q. I've heard that people sometimes use Internet chat areas to have <br />
	"cybersex." What exactly is that?<br />
A. This is when two people send explicitly steamy messages to each <br />
	other, back and forth, back and forth, faster and faster, <br />
	hotter and hotter,  faster and faster and hotter and harder <br />
	and harder until OHHHH GODDDDDDDD they suddenly find that <br />
	they have a bad case of sticky keyboard, if you get my drift.<br />
<br />
Q. That's disgusting!<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q. Could you give an example?<br />
A. Certainly:<br />
<br />
Born2Bone:  I want you NOW<br />
HunniBunni: I want YOU now<br />
Born2Bone:  I want to take off your clothes <br />
HunniBunni: Yes! YES!<br />
Born2Bone:  I'm taking off your clothes<br />
HunniBunni: OH YESSSS<br />
<br />
(LONGISH PAUSE)<br />
<br />
HunniBunni: Is something wrong?<br />
Born2Bone:  I can't unhook your brassiere <br />
HunniBunni: I'll do it<br />
Born2Bone:  Thanks. Oh my god! I'm touching your, umm, your... <br />
HunniBunni: Copious bosoms?<br />
Born2Bone:  Yes! Your copious bosoms! I'm touching them!<br />
HunniBunni: YES!<br />
Born2Bone:  Both of them!<br />
HunniBunni: YESSS!!<br />
Born2Bone:  I'm taking off your panties!<br />
HunniBunni: You already did.<br />
Born2Bone:  Oh, OK. You're naked! I'm touching your entire nakedness! <br />
HunniBunni: YESSSSSS!!!<br />
Wazootyman: Anybody here from Texas?<br />
Born2Bone:  No<br />
HunniBunni: No<br />
Born2Bone: I am becoming turgid in my manfulness! <br />
HunniBunni: YES! YES YOU ARE!! YOU ARE A BULL! YOU ARE MY GREAT BIG <br />
		RAGING BULL STALLION! <br />
Wazootyman: Hey, thanks<br />
HunniBunni: Not you<br />
Born2Bone:  I AM A STALLION! I AM A RAGING, BULGING BULL STALLION, AND I AM    <br />
            THRUSTING MY ... MY ... ummm ... <br />
HunniBunni: Your love knockwurst?<br />
Born2Bone:  YES! I AM THRUSTING MY LOVE KNOCKWURST INTO YOUR ... YOUR... <br />
HunniBunni: Promise you won't laugh?<br />
Born2Bone:  Yes<br />
HunniBunni: My passion persimmon<br />
Born2Bone:  Ha ha!<br />
HunniBunni: You promised!<br />
Born2Bone:  Sorry. OK, here goes: I AM THRUSTING MY MASSIVE KNOCKWURST <br />
		OF LOVE INTO YOUR PASSION PERSIMMON! <br />
HunniBunni: YES! YES! YES!<br />
Born2Bone:  OHHH! IT FEELS SO GOOD!! I FEEL POWERFUL!! <br />
HunniBunni: YOU ARE POWERFUL, BORN2BONE!! I FEEL YOUR POWER INSIDE ME!!! <br />
Born2Bone:  IT FEELS LIKE, LIKE ...<br />
HunniBunni: Like what?<br />
Born2Bone:  IT FEELS JUST LIKE, OHMIGOD ... OHMIGOD ... <br />
HunniBunni: TELL ME, BORN2BONE!! TELL WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!! <br />
Born2Bone:  OH LORD IT FEELS LIKE... IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I BREAK A TIE VOTE IN <br />
            	THE SENATE! <br />
HunniBunni: What did you say?<br />
Born2Bone:  Whoops<br />
HunniBunni: It feels like when you break a tie vote in the Senate?<br />
Born2Bone:  Umm, listen, what I meant was ... <br />
HunniBunni: This is you, isn't it, Al? ISN'T IT?? YOU JERK!!! YOU TOLD ME YOU <br />
             	WERE ATTENDING A STATE FUNERAL THIS AFTERNOON!!! <br />
Born2Bone: Tipper?<br />
HunniBunni.- Whoops<br />
<br />
Q. Aside from chatting, what else can I do on the Internet? <br />
A. You can join one of the thousands of forums wherein people, by posting <br />
	messages, discuss political topics of the day. <br />
<br />
Q. Like what?<br />
A. Barry Manilow.<br />
<br />
Q. There's a forum for Barry Manilow?<br />
A. There's a forum for everything.<br />
<br />
Q. What happens on these forums?<br />
A. Well, on the Barry Manilow forum, for example, fans post messages about<br />
	how much they love Barry Manilow, and other fans respond by posting <br />
	messages about how much they love Barry Manilow, too. And then <br />
	sometimes the forum is invaded by people posting messages about how <br />
	much they hate Barry Manilow, which in turn leads to angry <br />
	countermessages and vicious name-calling that can go on for months.<br />
<br />
Q. Just like junior high school!<br />
A. But even more pointless.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there forums about sex?<br />
A. Zillions of them.<br />
<br />
Q. What do people talk about on those?<br />
A. Barry Manilow.<br />
<br />
Q. No, really.<br />
A. OK, they talk about sex, but it is not all titillating. Often you'll <br />
	find highly scientific discussions that expand the frontiers of human <br />
	understanding.<br />
<br />
Q. It is a beautiful thing, the Internet. <br />
A. It is.<br />
<br />
Q. What is the "World Wide Web"?<br />
A. The World Wide Web is the multimedia version of the Internet, where you <br />
	can get not only text but also pictures and sounds on a semi-infinite <br />
	range of topics. This information is stored on "Web pages," which are <br />
	maintained by companies, institutions, and individuals. Using special <br />
	software, you can navigate to these pages and read, look at, or listen <br />
	to all kinds of cool stuff.<br />
<br />
Q. Wow! How can I get on the Web?<br />
A. It's easy! Suppose you're interested in buying a boat from an <br />
	Australian company that has a Web page featuring pictures and <br />
	specifications of its various models. All you have to do is fire up <br />
	your World Wide Web software and type in the company's Web page address, <br />
	which will probably be an intuitive, easy-to-remember string of <br />
	characters like this:<br />
<br />
http//:wwwfweemer-twirple.com/heppledork/sockitomesockitomefee##$.fle/fo/fum<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What if I type one single character wrong? <br />
A. You will launch U.S. nuclear missiles against Norway. <br />
<br />
Q. Ah.<br />
A. But assuming you type in the correct address, you merely press <br />
	Enter, and there you are!<br />
<br />
Q. Where?<br />
A. Sitting in front of your computer waiting for something to happen.  It <br />
	could take weeks. Entire new continents can emerge from the ocean in <br />
	the time it takes for a Web page to show up on your screen. Contrary to <br />
	what you may have heard, the Internet does not operate at the speed of <br />
	light; it operates at the speed of the Department of Motor Vehicles.. <br />
	It might be quicker for you to just go over to Australia and look at <br />
	the boats in person.<br />
<br />
Q. Does that mean that the World Wide Web is useless? <br />
A. Heck no! If you're willing to be patient, you'll find that you can utilize <br />
	the vast resources of the Web to waste time in ways that you <br />
	never before dreamed possible.<br />
<br />
Q. For example?<br />
A. For example, recently I was messing around with a "Web browser," which is <br />
	a kind of software that lets you search all of cyberspace - millions <br />
	of documents for references to a specific word or group of words. You <br />
	can find pretty much everything that anybody has ever written on the <br />
	Internet about that topic; it's an incredibly powerful research tool. <br />
<br />
Q. That is truly beautiful.<br />
A. Yes. And it's just one teensy little piece, one infinitesimally tiny <br />
	fraction, of the gigantic, pulsating, mutating, multiplying mass of <br />
	stuff out there on the Internet. Sooner or later, everything is going <br />
	to be on there somewhere. You should be on there, too. Don't be <br />
	afraid! Be like the bold explorer Christopher Columbus, (E-mail <br />
	address: ChrisCol@nina,pinta&santamaria.ahoy) setting out into <br />
	uncharted waters, fearful of what you might encounter, but also <br />
	mindful of the old inspirational maritime saying: "If you don't leave <br />
	the land, then you'll probably never have a chance to get scurvy and <br />
	develop anemia, spongy gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes." <br />
<br />
So come on! join me and millions of others on this exciting CyberFrontier, <br />
with its limitless possibilities for the enhancement of knowledge and the <br />
betterment of the human race!<br />
<br />
Wazootyman is waiting for you.<br />

The Life of a Computer Analyst<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
	Monday<br />
 	------<br />
<br />
	 8:05am<br />
<br />
	User called to say they forgot password.  Told them to use<br />
	password  retrieval utility called FDISK.  Blissfully ignorant,<br />
	they thank me  and hang up.  God, we let the people vote and<br />
	drive, too?<br />
<br />
	 8:12am<br />
	<br />
	Accounting called to say they couldn't access expense reports <br />
	database.  Gave them Standard Sys Admin Answer #112, "Well, it <br />
	works for me."  Let them rant and rave while I unplugged my<br />
	coffeemaker from the UPS and plugged their server back in. <br />
	Suggested they try it again.  One more happy customer...<br />
<br />
	 8:14 am<br />
<br />
	User from 8:05 call said they received error message "Error <br />
	accessing Drive 0."  Told them it was an OS problem.  <br />
	Transferred them to microsupport.<br />
<br />
	 11:00 am<br />
<br />
	Relatively quiet for last few hours.  Decide to plug support<br />
	phone back in so I can call my girlfriend.  Says parents are<br />
	coming  into town this weekend. Put her on hold and transferred<br />
	her to janitorial closet down in basement. What is she thinking? The<br />
	"Myst" and  "Doom" nationals are this weekend!<br />
	<br />
	 11:34 am<br />
	<br />
	Another user calls (do they ever learn?).  Says they want ACL<br />
	changed on HR performance review database so that nobody but HR<br />
	can  access database. Tell them no problem.  Hang up.  Change<br />
	ACL.  Add  @MailSend so performance reviews are sent to */US.<br />
	<br />
	 12:00 pm<br />
	<br />
	Lunch<br />
	<br />
	 3:30 pm<br />
	<br />
	Return from lunch.<br />
	<br />
	 3:55 pm<br />
	<br />
	Wake up from nap.  Bad dream makes me cranky.  Bounce servers for no<br />
	reason.  Return to napping.<br />
	<br />
	 4:23 pm<br />
	<br />
	Yet another user calls.  Wants to know how to change fonts on<br />
	form.  Ask them what chip set they're using.  Tell them to call<br />
	back when  they find out.<br />
	<br />
	 4:55 pm<br />
	<br />
	Decide to run "Create Save/Replication Conflicts" macro so next <br />
	shift has something to do.<br />
	<br />
	 Tuesday<br />
	 -------<br />
	<br />
	 8:30 am<br />
	<br />
	Finish reading support log from last night.  Sounded busy. <br />
	Terrible time with Save/Replication conflicts.<br />
	<br />
	 9:00 am<br />
	<br />
	Support manager arrives.  Wants to discuss my attitude.  Click on<br />
	PhoneNotes SmartIcon.  "Love to, but kinda busy.  Put something in the<br />
	calendar database!"  I yell as I grab for the support lines, which<br />
	have (mysteriously) lit up.  Walks away grumbling. <br />
	<br />
	 9:35 pm<br />
	<br />
	Team leader from R&D needs ID for new employee.  Tell them they<br />
	need form J-19R=9C9\\DARR\K1.  Say they never heard of such a<br />
	form.  Tell them it's in the SPECIAL FORMS database.  Say they<br />
	never heard of  such a database.  Transfer them to janitorial<br />
	closet in basement.<br />
	<br />
	 10:00 am<br />
	<br />
	Perky sounding intern from R&D calls and says she needs new ID. <br />
	Tell her I need employee number, department name, manager name,<br />
	and  marital status.  Run @DbLookup against state parole board<br />
	database, Centers for Disease Control database, and my Oprah<br />
	Winfrey database. No hits. Tell her ID will be ready tonight. <br />
	Drawing from the  lessons learned in last week's "Reengineering<br />
	for Customer Partnership,"<br />
	<br />
	I offer to personally deliver ID to her apartment.<br />
	<br />
	 10:07 am<br />
	<br />
	Janitor stops by to say he keeps getting strange calls in<br />
	basement. Offer to train him on Notes.  Begin now.  Let him watch<br />
	console  while I grab a smoke.<br />
	<br />
	 1:00 pm<br />
	<br />
	Return from smoking break.  Janitor says phones kept ringing, so he<br />
	transferred them to cafeteria lady. I like this guy.<br />
	<br />
	 1:05 pm<br />

	<br />

	<br />
	Call Louie in janitorial services to cover for me.  Go to support<br />
	manager's office.  He says he can't dismiss me but can suggest several<br />
	lateral career moves.  Most involve farm implements in third-world<br />
	countries with moderate to heavy political turmoil. By and by, I  ask<br />
	if he's aware of new bug which takes full-text indexed random e-mail<br />
	databases and puts all references to furry handcuffs and Bambi Boomer<br />
	in Marketing on the corporate Web page.  Meeting is adjourned as  he<br />

	New guy ("Marvin") started today.  "Nice plaids" I offer.  Show<br />
	him  server room, wiring closet, and technical library.  Set him<br />
	up with  IBM PC-XT. Tell him to quit whining, Notes runs the same in<br />
	both monochrome and color.<br />
	<br />
	 8:45 am<br />
	<br />
	New guy's PC finishes booting up.  Tell him I'll create new ID<br />

	employee  beginning on days ending in 'Y' shall enjoy all proper<br />
	aspects with said corporation, said employee is obligated to<br />
	provide sustenance and  relief to senior technical analyst on<br />
	shift."  Marvin doubts.  I point  to "Corporate Policy" database<br />
	(a fine piece of work, if I say so myself!).  "Remember, that's<br />
	DOUBLE pepperoni and NO peppers!" I yell to Marvin as he steps<br />
	over open floor tile to get to exit door. <br />
	<br />
	 1:00 pm<br />
	<br />
	Oooooh!  Pizza makes me so sleepy... <br />

	calls myself. Unforward phones from Mailroom.<br />

	<br />
	Yep.  A user call.  Users in Des Moines can't replicate.  Me and<br />
	the  Oiuji board determine it's sunspots.  Tell them to call <br />
	Telecommunications.<br />
	<br />
	 9:30 am<br />
	<br />
	Good God, another user!  They're like ants.  Says he's in San<br />
	Diego and can't replicate with Des Moines.  Tell him it's<br />

	if he's seen corporate Web page lately.<br />
	<br />
	 3:00 pm<br />
	<br />
	Another (novice) user calls.  Says periodic macro not working.<br />
	Suggest they place @DeleteDocument at end of formula.  Promise to send<br />
	them document addendum which says so.<br />

   </div><div>The Seven Stages of a Usenet Poster<br />
With Illustrative Examples<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Innocence<br />
<br />
HI.  I AM NEW HERE.  WHY DO THEY CALL THIS TALK.BIZARRE?  I THINK THAT THIS<br />
NEWSGROUP (OOPS, NEWSFROUP -- HEE, HEE) STUFF IS REAL NEAT.  :-) <-- MY<br />
FIRST SMILEY; DO YOU HAVE INTERESTING ONES?  PLEASE POST SOME; I THINK THAT<br />
THEIR COOL.  DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY BIZARRE DEAD BABY JOKES?<br />
<br />
2. Enthusiasm<br />
<br />
Wow!  This stuff is great!  But one thing I've noticed is that everytime<br />
someone tries to tell a dead baby jokes, everyone says that they don't want<br />
to hear them.  This really sucks; there are a lot of us who *like* dead<br />
baby jokes.  Therefore, I propose that we create the newsgroup:<br />
<br />
rec.humor.dead.babes<br />
<br />
specifically for those of us who like these jokes.  Can anyone tell me how<br />
to create a newsgroup?<br />
<br />
3. Arrogance<br />
<br />
In message (3.14159@BAR), FOO@BAR.BITNET says:<br />
<br />
> [dead chicken joke deleted]<br />
<br />
This sort of joke DOES NOT BELONG HERE!  Can't you read the rules?  Gene<br />
Spafford _a clearly_ states in the List of Newsgroups:<br />
<br />
rec.humor.dead.babes Dead Baby joke swapping<br />
<br />
Simple enough for you?  It's not enough that the creature be dead, it<br />
*must* be a baby -- capeesh?<br />
<br />
This person is clearly scum -- they're even hiding behind a pseudonym.  I<br />
mean, what kind of a name is FOO, anyway?  I am writing to the sysadmin at<br />
BAR.BITNET requesting that this person's net access be revoked immediately.<br />
If said sysadmin does not comply, they are obviously in on it -- I will<br />
urge that their feeds cut them off post-haste, so that they cannot spread<br />
this kind of $#!T over the net.<br />
<br />
4. Disgust<br />

<br />
Are you people completely devoid of imagination?  We've heard this joke *at<br />
least* 20 times, in the past three months alone!<br />
<br />
When we first started this newsgroup, it was dynamic and innovative.  We<br />
would trade dead baby jokes that were truly fresh; ones that no one had<br />
heard before.  Half the jokes were *completely* original to this group.<br />
Now, all we have are hacks who want to hear themselves speak.  You people<br />
are dull as dishwater.  I give up; I'm unsubscribing, as of now.  You can<br />
have your stupid arguments without Me.  Goodbye!<br />
<br />
5. Resignation<br />
<br />
In message (12345@wildebeest) wildman@wildebeest complains:<br />
<br />
>In message (2@newsite) newby@newsite (Jim Newbs) writes:<br />

<br />
Hey, wildman, chill out.  When you've been around as long as I have, you'll<br />
come to understand that twits are a part of life on the net.  Look at it<br />
this way:  at least they haven't overwhelmed us yet.  Most of the jokes in<br />
rec.humor.dead.babes.new are still fresh and interesting.  We can hope that<br />
people like newby above will go lurk until they understand the subtleties<br />
of dead baby joke creation, but we should bear with them if they don't.<br />
Keep your cool, and don't let it bug you.<br />
<br />
6. Ossification<br />
<br />

> That doesn't even make sense! Your logic is completely flawed. Think a<br />
<br />
It should be clear to people by now that this Cluckhead is full of it.<br />
There is no interest in rec.humor.dead.chicken, so it should not be<br />
created.<br />
<br />
People like this really burn me.  Doesn't he realize that it will just take<br />
a few more newsgroups to bring this whole house of cards down around us?<br />
First, we get rec.humor.dead.chicken (and undoubtedly,<br />
rec.humor.dead.chicken.new).  Next, they'll be asking for rec.humor.ethnic.<br />
Then, rec.humor.newfy.  By that time, all of the news admins in the world<br />
will have decided to drop us completely.  Is that what you want, Cluck?  To<br />
bring about the end of Usenet?  Humph!<br />
<br />
I urge everyone to vote against this proposal.  The current system works,<br />
and we shouldn't push at it, lest it break.<br />
<br />
7. Nostalgia<br />
<br />
Well, they've just created rec.humor.ethnic.newfoundland.bizarre.  My, how<br />
things have grown.  It seems like such a short time ago that I first joined<br />
this net.  At the time, there were only two newsgroups under the humorous<br />
banner:  rec.humor and rec.humor.funny.  I'm amazed at how things have<br />
split.  Nowadays, you have to have twenty newsgroups in your sequencer just<br />
to keep up with the *new* jokes.  Ah, for the good old days, when we could<br />
read about it all in one place...<br />

<br />
<br />
	1. Strange...<br />
<br />
	2. I've never heard about that.<br />
<br />
	3. It did work yesterday.<br />
<br />
	4. Well, the program needs some fixing.<br />
<br />
	5. How is this possible?<br />
<br />
	6. The machine seems to be broken.<br />
<br />
	7. Has the operating system been updated?<br />
<br />
	8. The user has made an error again.<br />
<br />
	9. There is something wrong in your test data.<br />
<br />
	10. I have not touched that module!<br />
<br />
	11. Yes yes, it will be ready in time.<br />
<br />
	12. You must have the wrong executable.<br />
<br />
	13. Oh, it's just a feature.<br />
<br />
	14. I'm almost ready.<br />
<br />
	15. Of course, I just have to do these small fixes.<br />
<br />
	16. It will be done in no time at all.<br />
<br />
	17. It's just some unlucky coincidense.<br />
<br />
	18. I can't test everything!<br />
<br />
	19. THIS can't do THAT.<br />
<br />
	20. Didn't I fix it already?<br />
<br />
	21. It's already there, but it has not been tested.<br />
<br />
	22. It works, but it's not been tested.<br />
<br />
	23. Somebody must have changed my code.<br />
<br />
	24. There must be a virus in the application software.<br />
<br />
	25. Even though it does not work, how does it feel? <br />

Found on the net. Author unknown. <br />
<br />
If IBM made toasters...<br />
They would want one big toaster where people bring<br />
bread to be submitted for overnight toasting. IBM<br />
would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six<br />
toasters. <br />
<br />
If Microsoft made toasters...<br />
Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have<br />
to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the<br />
toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it anyway.<br />
Toaster'95 would weigh 15000 pounds (hence requiring a<br />
reinforced steel countertop), draw enough electricity<br />
to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in<br />
your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that<br />
let's you control how light or dark you want your<br />
toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other<br />
appliances to find out who made them. Everyone would<br />
hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless would buy<br />
them since most of the good bread only works with<br />
their toasters. <br />
<br />
If Apple made toasters...<br />
It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but<br />
5 years earlier (and of course, it would do it<br />
better). When you cut your toast, it bleeds in 6<br />
colors. . <br />
<br />
If The Rand Corporation made toasters...<br />
It would be a large, perfectly smooth and seamless<br />
black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of<br />
toast on top of it. Their service department would<br />
have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for<br />
the box would be highly classified government<br />
documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the NSA made toasters...<br />
Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only<br />
the NSA could access in case they needed to get at<br />
your toast for reasons of national security. <br />
<br />
If NASA made toasters...<br />
The toast would burst into flames shortly after<br />
popping up. <br />
<br />
Does DEC still make toasters?...<br />
They made good toasters in the '70s, didn't they? <br />
<br />
If Hewlett-Packard made toasters...<br />
They would market the Reverse Polish Toaster, which<br />
takes in toast and gives you regular bread. <br />
<br />
If Sony made toasters...<br />
Their Sony Toastman, which would be barely larger than<br />
the single piece of bread it is meant to toast, can be<br />
conveniently attached to your belt. <br />
<br />
If the Franklin Mint made toasters...<br />
Every month, you would receive another lovely<br />
hand-crafted piece of your authentic Civil War pewter<br />
toaster. <br />
<br />
If Cray made toasters...<br />
They would cost $16 million but would be faster than<br />
any other single-slice toaster in the world, at least<br />
for a couple of years. <br />
<br />
If Thinking Machines made toasters...<br />
You would be able to toast 64,000 thousand pieces of<br />
bread at the same time. <br />
<br />
If Timex made toasters...<br />
They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist<br />
toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting. <br />
<br />
If Xerox made toasters...<br />
You could toast one-sided or double-sided. Successive<br />
slices would get lighter and lighter. The toaster<br />
would jam your bread for you. <br />
<br />
If Radio Shack made toasters...<br />
The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know<br />
anything about it. You would be able to buy all the<br />
parts to build your own toaster. <br />
<br />
If K-Tel sold toasters...<br />
They would not be available in stores, and you would<br />
get a free set of Ginsu knives. <br />
<br />
If ParcPlace made toasters...<br />
Their OO building block system would be called EGGO. <br />
<br />
If Oracle made toasters...<br />
They'd claim their toaster was compatible with all<br />
brands and styles of bread, but when you got it home<br />
you'd discover the Bagel Engine was still in<br />
development, the Croissant Extension was three years<br />
away, and that indeed the whole appliance was just<br />
blowing smoke. <br />
<br />
If Sun made toasters...<br />
The toast would burn often, but you could get a really<br />
good cuppa Java. <br />
<br />
If Tandem made toasters...<br />
You could make toast 24 hours a day, and if a piece<br />
got burned the toaster would automatically toast you a<br />
new one. <br />
<br />
If Fisher Price made toasters...<br />
"Baby's First Toaster" would have a hand-crank that<br />
you turn to toast the bread that pops up like a<br />
Jack-in-the-box. <br />
<br />
If CostCo made toasters...<br />
They'd be really cheap, as long as you bought a<br />
six-pack of 'em. <br />

  Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it.  Their<br />

If Microsoft made toasters...<br />
  Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a<br />
  toaster.  You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still<br />
  have to pay for it anyway.  Toaster'95 would weigh 15000 pounds<br />
  (hence requiring a reinforced steel countertop), draw enough<br />
  electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in<br />
  your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that lets you<br />
  control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would<br />
  secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made<br />
  them.  Everyone would hate Microsoft toasters, but nonetheless<br />
  would buy them since most of the good bread only works with their<br />
  toasters.<br />
<br />
If Apple made toasters...<br />
  It would do everything the Microsoft toaster does, but 5 years<br />
  earlier.<br />

Hello, and thank you for reading this letter.  You see, there is a starving<br />
little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who as no arms, no legs, no parents,<br />
and no pecker.  This little boy's life could be saved, because for every<br />
time you pass this on, a dollar will be donated to the Starving Legless<br />
Armless Parentless Peckerless Little Boys from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund.<br />
 Remember, we have no way of counting letters sent.  So go on, reach out.<br />
<br />
Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds.  Oh, and a reminder- if you<br />

Chain Letter Type III<br />
<br />
Hi there!!  This chain letter has been in existence since 1897. This is<br />
absolutely incredible because there was no email then and probably not as<br />
many little 8 year olds writing chain letters. So this is how it works. Pass<br />
this on to 15,067 people in the next 7 minutes or something horrible will<br />
happen to you like:<br />
<br />
Queer Horror Story #1<br />
Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had recently<br />
received this letter and ignored it.  She then tripped in a crack in the<br />
side walk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of<br />
poop, and went flying out over a waterfall.  Not only did she smell nasty,<br />
she died. This Could Happen To You!!!<br />
<br />
Queer Horror Story #2<br />
Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and ignored it<br />
.  Later that day, he was hit by a car and so was his boyfriend (hey, some<br />
people swing that way, especially at Oklahoma City University).  They both<br />
died and went to hell. They continued to suffer in hell where they were both<br />
cursed to eat adorable kittens every day for eternity.  This Could Happen To<br />
You!!!<br />
<br />
Remember, you could end up like Pinsley and Bip did.  Just send this letter<br />
to all of your loser friends, and everything will be Ok.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's the guy in Peoria Illinois who DID forward this on and<br />
then he married his secret crush, they moved to the suburbs, had 2.3<br />
children and lived happily ever after.<br />
<br />
Right up until he started working late every night, started an affair with<br />
his secretary and boozing.  Then she started sleeping with the golf pro at<br />
the local country club, became addicted to sleeping pills and their 2.3<br />
children got into gangs and drugs. Then everything went to hell, and they<br />
got divorced.  She got the house and the kids, and he got the car and child<br />
support payment, and got to keep the mortgage payment, lost his job and his<br />
car and now is working the midnight shift at the local McDonald's.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Chain Letter Type IV<br />
<br />
As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote.  Send it to every one of your<br />
friends.<br />
<br />
Friends<br />
- A friend is someone who is always at your side,<br />
- A friend is someone who likes you even though you smell like a wet dog,<br />
- A friend is someone who likes you even though you're disgustingly ugly,<br />
- A friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled yourself,<br />
- A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry about<br />
   your loser life,<br />
- A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really think<br />
   you should be raped by a mad goat and then thrown to vicious dogs, - A<br />
friend is someone who scrubs your toilet and vacuums and then gets<br />
  the check and leaves and doesn't speak much English no, sorry that's   <br />
 the cleaning lady,<br />
<br />
Now pass this on! If you don't, Satan will send dogs in heat to your room in<br />
your sleep!!<br />
<br />
There.   Now that we've covered and dumped on the four main types of chain<br />
letters, onto the ironic part.  In order for this to get any popularity,<br />
send it on!!!  If you don't think it was funny at all, don't bother, but<br />
otherwise forward this sucker to everyone you know!!  If you don't, I don't<br />
care.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Remember, the moral of the story is, if you get a chain letter, ignore it.<br />
<br />
TRASH IT!!!  If it's a joke or something, send it, sure! Just don't forget<br />
to delete the chain letter part.  But if it's gonna make people feel guilty <br />
(i.e. the willieless boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen) or nervous (i.e.<br />
Miranda Pinsley who ended up in a waterfall of poop), just DELETE it.<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor, and everyone else in the world, and say NO!!! to <br />
BLOODY CHAIN LETTERS!!"  Thank you.<br />

   </div><div>The Mystery of the Vanishing Video Tapes<br />
by Bill Hall, Lewiston, Idaho Tribune, April 15, 1992<br />
<br />
<br />
First, we solved the puzzle of disappearing socks and the mystery of<br />
multiplying coat hangers.  Today, we solve the strange case of the<br />
disappearing video tapes.<br />
<br />
I was among the millions who couldn't explain the chronic disappearance<br />
of socks and the way hangers accumulate in vast numbers in the dark<br />
recesses of your closet, making you wonder what the male coat hangers<br />
and the female coat hangers are doing in there.<br />
<br />
But then I realized that socks are the larval stage of coat hangers.<br />
The socks disappear because they open their wings when we aren't looking<br />
and become hangers.<br />
<br />
But what is the explanation for constantly running out of video tapes?<br />
You could buy a carload of tapes for your video recorder, but when you<br />
suddenly see something on television that you must have, you cannot find<br />
a blank one.<br />
<br />
My first guess, of course, was that video tapes are sock eggs, which<br />
become socks, which become coat hangers.<br />
<br />
But there's more to it than that.  My relatives get part of the blame.<br />
In this society, if you get a new car or spouse or cat or house, you<br />
take video pictures and send them to all the relatives.  It's like<br />
snapshots, only a lot more cumbersome and expensive.<br />
<br />
But that's small potatoes.  A friend points out the larger explantion:<br />
There are members of each family who tend to tape programs and squirrel<br />
them away without watching them.<br />
<br />
His wife, for instance.  Somewhere in their house, she has tucked away<br />
several hundred tapes, each one containing a program that they really<br />
ought to watch one day soon.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about entertainment programs like movies and sit-coms<br />
and game shows and football games or even half-hour infomercials<br />
featuring old movie stars paid to tell you they haven't had a wrinkle<br />
since they started applying buckets of Wonder Goo to their aging<br />
kissers.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about programs that are so good for you they hurt cultural<br />
and informational programs that you really ought to watch, but don't.<br />
I'm talking, for instance, about the sort of public television program<br />
that people who like public television don't even watch.  But they feel<br />
guilty about not watching those offerings so they tape the shows and<br />
plan to watch them when they get time.<br />
<br />
But they never get time.  These tapes are the equivalent of all the<br />
magazine articles and special newspaper sections and environmental<br />
pamphlets and Republican position papers that you stack up and really<br />
intend to read one of these days.<br />
<br />
In the early days of television, we had only two choices when it came to<br />
programs that were good for us.  If they had a program, for instance, on<br />
the history of the American vice presidency or on the evolution of the<br />
flute or on the causes of liberal extremism in Utah, you watched it or<br />
you didn't watch it.<br />
<br />
Today, there is a third possibility:<br />
<br />
Let your video recorder watch it for you.<br />
<br />
That's all you have to do.  That clears your conscience and squares you<br />
with your fellow do-gooders.  You don't have to actually sit through<br />
that mind rot yourself.  You just have to plan to watch it one of these<br />
days or at least promise to fast-forward through the meaty portions.<br />
<br />
That is the virtue of robots, as opposed to children, servants or<br />
employees.  A robot is just a machine so there is no task so distasteful<br />
that you can't order the robot to do it.<br />
<br />
Today, we have robots that fight fires, robots that pour molten metal,<br />
robots that clean up nuclear waste and robots that mix noxious<br />
chemicals.  And now we have robots that watch chemistry lectures, modern<br />
dance recitals and political debates.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot of tape but it gives a person a certain standing in the<br />
right circles:<br />
<br />
"Did you watch the city council debate last night?"<br />
<br />
"No, but my video recorder did."<br />
<br />
<br />

Actual dialog of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 "Ridge Hall computer assistant; may I help you?"<br />
 "Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."<br />
 "What sort of trouble?"<br />
 "Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went<br />
	away."<br />
 "Went away?"<br />
 "They disappeared."<br />
 "Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?"<br />
 "Nothing."<br />
 "Nothing?"<br />
 "It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."<br />
 "Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"<br />
 "How do I tell?"<br />
 "Can you see the C:\prompt on the screen?"<br />
 "What's a sea-prompt?"<br />
 "Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?"<br />
 "There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type."<br />
 "Does your monitor have a power indicator?"<br />
 "What's a monitor?"<br />
 "It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV.<br />
	Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?"<br />
 "I don't know."<br />
 "Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power<br />
	cord goes into it. Can you see that?"<br />
 "Yes, I think so."<br />
 "Great! Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into<br />
	the wall."<br />
 "Yes, it is."<br />
 "When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two<br />
	cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?"<br />
 "No."<br />
 "Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the<br />
	other cable."<br />
 "Okay, here it is."<br />
 "Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely in to the back<br />
	of your computer."<br />
 "I can't reach."<br />
 "Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?"<br />
 "No."<br />
 "Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"<br />
 "Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle-it's because it's<br />
	dark."<br />
 "Dark?"<br />
 "Yes-the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in<br />
	from the window."<br />
 "Well, turn on the office light then."<br />
 "I can't."<br />
 "No? Why not?"<br />
 "Because there's a power outage."<br />
 "A power... A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now.  Do you <br />
	still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer<br />
   	came in?"<br />
 "Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."<br />
 "Good! Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it<br />
	was when you got it.  Then take it back to the store you bought <br />
	it from."<br />
 "Really? Is it that bad?"<br />
 "Yes, I'm afraid it is."<br />
 "Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"<br />
 "Tell them, you are too stupid to own a computer".<br />

   </div><div>Web-Surfing Drinking Game<br />
<br />
<br />
With the recent rise of "Geek culture," the long-held misperception that<br />
computer users are solitary, electronic slaves is slowly receding like a<br />
ten percent drop shadow.  Geeks have asserted for years that they can<br />
party as hard as any testosterone-filled football player.  To prove it, we<br />
present the TidBITS Web Surfing Party Game (TBWSPG, pronounced "Fred").<br />
<br />
Fred is best experienced in a group setting (say, a rack of office<br />
cubicles at lunch time), but you can also play at home alone or networked,<br />
of course.  To play, choose your favorite drink, connect to your ISP, and<br />
start surfing the Web.  Remember to be responsible, and hand over the<br />
mouse when you've drunk too much.<br />
<br />
DRINK ONCE IF ...<br />
	* your modem has to redial when connecting to your ISP (if more <br />
		than five times, stop drinking and cancel that darn AOL <br />
		account already!)<br />
	* you see a "Best Viewed With..." tag (twice if it's animated)<br />
	* you get any error message (bad URL, etc.)<br />
	* you see an under construction sign<br />
	* you view a page with a Web counter (twice if it's a broken <br />
		graphic)<br />
	* you view a blink tag (not necessary to drink for every blink)<br />
	* you come across a Java applet (twice if it doesn't load)<br />
	* you see the phrase "cool links"<br />
	* a background sound loads (you also must dance with drink in hand)<br />
	* your browser crashes<br />
	* you have to resize the browser window<br />
	* a graphic doesn't load<br />
<br />
DRINK TWICE IF ...<br />
	* you hit a JavaScript error<br />
	* you arrive at a password-protected site (if you can guess the <br />
		password in three tries, collect a dollar from everyone in <br />
		the room and chug drink)<br />
	* you find a home page purportedly belonging to someone's pet<br />
	* "cool" is spelled "kewl"<br />
	* you have to download a plug-in and restart your browser<br />
	* the graphics are broken on a Web designer's home pages<br />
<br />
SPECIAL RULE ...<br />
	* If you hit a Shockwave project, you have to wait to drink until <br />
		it's downloaded (This is a good chance to walk to the store <br />
		for more drinks, render 3D images, or write a new operating <br />
		system.)<br />

   </div>
   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Where_Do_the_Deleted_Characters_Go.html">Where Do The Deleted Characters Go</a></h2>
   </div><div>Where do the Deleted Characters Go?<br />
<br />
<br />
 QUESTION:<br />
 Where do the character go when I use the backspace or  on my PC?<br />
<br />
 ANSWER:<br />
 If you must know, the characters can go to different places, depending on <br />
 whom you ask:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) The Catholic?s approach to characters:<br />
<br />
    The nice characters go to character heaven, where life is good.  The <br />
    characters are bathed in the light of happiness, all their troubles <br />
    are soothed, and there?s not a delete key, eraser, or white-out bottle <br />
    in sight.  Most of the nice characters are A?s and I?s, those that <br />
    have never been -- er -- involved with other characters.  Often, <br />
    you?ll see A?s or I?s with N?s or T?s.  These are characters in love: <br />
    monogamous on the page, together again after deletion.  You?ll see <br />
    quite a few Q?s too.  They seem to feel particularly guilty for no <br />
    good reason.<br />
<br />
    The naughty characters are punished for their sins.  In case you were <br />
    wondering what is the difference between a nice character and a <br />
    naughty character is, I?ll tell you.  Naughty characters are those <br />
    involved in the creation of naughty words, such as, "breast," "sex," <br />
    "objectivity," and depending upon usage, such words as, "feminism," <br />
    "reproductive freedom," "contraception," and "science."  You may ask, <br />
    and rightly so, why the characters are blamed for their own <br />
    configuration.  But we feel that a character has an obligation to <br />
    oppose any naughtiness in its own configuration.  If it truly felt <br />
    guilty about the word it was forming, it would rebel.<br />
<br />
2) The Buddhist Explanation<br />
<br />
    If a character has lived rightly, and its karma is good, then after it<br />
    has been deleted, it will be reincarnated as a different, higher <br />
    character.  Those funny characters above the numbers on your keyboard <br />
    will become numbers, numbers will become letters, lower-case letters <br />
    will become upper-case letters, and the most righteous and good of <br />
    letters will become C?s.  Why C?s, you ask?  Who knows, but C it is.  <br />
    If a character?s karma is not so good, then it will move down the <br />
    above scale, ultimately becoming the lowest of characters, a space.<br />
<br />
3) The 20th Century bitter cynical nihilist explanation:<br />
<br />
    Who cares?  All characters are the same, swirling in a vast sea of <br />
    meaningless nothingness.  It doesn?t really matter if they?re on the <br />
    page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc.  It?s all the same.  More <br />
    characters should delete themselves.   (Nihilist characters are easy <br />
    to identify.  They?re usually pale and tragic, and they smoke a lot)<br />
<br />
4) The Mac User?s Explanation<br />
<br />
    All the characters written on a PC and then deleted and go straight to <br />
    PC hell.  If you?re using a PC, you can probably see the deleted <br />
    characters, because you?re in PC hell also.<br />
<br />
5) Stephen King?s Explanation<br />
<br />
    Every time you hit the  key you unleash a tiny monster inside <br />
    the cursor, who tears the poor unsuspecting characters to shreds, <br />
    drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all.  Hah, Hah, Hah!<br />
<br />
6) Dave Barry?s Explanation<br />
<br />
    The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where <br />
    they?re made into Pop-Tart filling;  this explains why Pop-Tarts are <br />
    so flammable, while cheap imitations are not as flammable.  I?m not <br />
    making any of this up.<br />
<br />
7) IBM?s Explanation<br />
<br />
    The characters are not real.  They exist only on the screen when they <br />
    are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to <br />
    de-conceptualize them.  Get a life.<br />
<br />
8) PETA?s Explanation<br />
<br />
    You?ve been DELETING them????  Can?t you hear them SCREAMING??? Why <br />
    don?t you go CLUB some BABY SEALS while wearing a MINK, you pig!!!!!<br />

7. The number of pages in the *EASY-INSTALL* version of the manual.<br />
6. The percentage of existing windows programs that wont run in the new OS.<br />
5. The number of minutes to install.<br />
4. The number of calls to tech support before you can get it to run.<br />
3. The number of people who will actually PAY for the upgrade.<br />
2. The number Mhz required for the OS to run.<br />
And now the #1 thing people think the 95 in Windows95 really stands for..<br />
<br />
(Drum roll please...)<br />

   </div><div>Windows 76?<br />
By Hans Brakob <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our founding fathers on PCs:<br />
<br />
1776<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Gentlemen, the summer grows hot, and it is essential <br />
hat we complete this Declaration of Independence.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: Wait a minute, Thomas. I have to reboot here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: That's all right, Ben. We'll go on without you. Has<br />
everyone had a chance to look at the draft I posted yesterday?<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: Not yet, Thomas, I've been having Notes replication <br />
problems.<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: Here, Roger, I brought a hard copy<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: Thanks, Saaaaay, nice font.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: Do you like it? I downloaded it off Colonies Online <br />
just last week.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Gentlemen! There is work to be done. I fear our <br />
document will soon leak out.<br />
<br />
Mr. Livingston: Too late, Thomas. There's already a bootleg circulating.<br />
<br />
I saw it posted on alt.georgeIII.sucks last night.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: @#$$%^^$# General Protection Fault!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: Ben, you might try upgrading to Windows 75. It solved that<br />
problem for me.<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: Thomas, the part here about the Acts of Pretended <br />
Legislation; have you considered using bullets to air out the text?<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: I can fix that easily enough. Drat! I've spilled <br />
candle wax on my keyboard again.<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams: You know, Thomas, that wouldn't happen if you'd buy an<br />
active-matrix screen.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: Hard-disk failure?!? Aw, criminy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr. Livingston: Are you sure it's "unalienable rights"? My spell checker<br />
recommends "unassailable".<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Can we stick to the substance of the document, please?<br />
Shoot. Low battery. Anyone got a spare power cable?<br />
<br />
Mr. Sherman: What have you got, a Toshiba? No, mine isn't compatible.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: Hello, PCs Philadelphia? What does it mean when the <br />
floppy drive buzzes? OK, I'll hold.....<br />
<br />
Mr. Livingston: The "In Congress" part here at the top; have you thought<br />
about blowing that up really big and maybe centering it in <br />
72-point Helvetica?<br />
<br />
Mr. Jefferson: Not a bad idea. Aw, nuts! Word macro virus! I can't save the<br />
file.<br />
<br />
Mr. Franklin: That's all right, Thomas. We can manage. Here, borrow my<br />
quill pen....<br />
<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/WordPerfect_Helpline.html">WordPerfect Helpline</a></h2>
   </div><div>This is a true story from the WordPerfect Helpline which was transcribed <br />
from a recording monitoring the customer care department. Needless to say, <br />
the Help Desk employee was fired however, he is currently suing the <br />
WordPerfect organization for "Termination without Cause." This is the actual <br />
dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee (Now I know why <br />
they record these conversations)<br />
<br />
"Rich Hall computer assistance; may I help you?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."<br />
<br />
"What sort of trouble?"<br />
<br />
"Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away."<br />
"Went away?"<br />
<br />
"They disappeared."<br />
<br />
"Hmmm. So what does your screen look like now?"<br />
<br />
"Nothing."<br />
<br />
"Nothing?"<br />
<br />
"It's a blank; it won' t accept anything when I type."<br />
<br />
"Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"<br />
<br />
"How do I tell?"<br />
<br />
"Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?"<br />
<br />
"What's a sea-prompt?"<br />
<br />
"Never mind, can you move your cursor around the screen?"<br />
<br />
"There isn't any cursor: I told you, it won't accept anything I type."<br />
<br />
"Does your monitor have a power indicator?"<br />
<br />
"What's a monitor?"<br />
<br />
"It's the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV. Does it have a <br />
little light that tells you when it's on?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know."<br />
<br />
"Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord <br />
goes into it.<br />
<br />
"Can you see that?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, I think so."<br />
<br />
"Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it's plugged into the <br />
wall."<br />
<br />
"Yes, it is."<br />
<br />
"When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables <br />
plugged into the back of it, not just one?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other <br />
cable."<br />
<br />
"Okay, here it is."<br />
<br />
"Follow it for me, and tell me if it's plugged securely into the back of <br />
your computer."<br />
<br />
"I can't reach."<br />
<br />
"Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?"<br />
<br />
"No."<br />
<br />
"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"<br />
<br />
"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle it's because it's dark."<br />
<br />
"Dark?"<br />
<br />
"Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from <br />
the window."<br />
<br />
"Well, turn on the office light then."<br />
<br />
"I can't."<br />
<br />
"No? Why not?"<br />
<br />
"Because there's a power failure."<br />
<br />
"A power.......a power failure?.... Aha, Okay, we've got it licked now. Do <br />
you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came <br />
in?"<br />
<br />
"Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."<br />
<br />
"Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was <br />
when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from."<br />
<br />
"Really? Is it that bad?"<br />
<br />
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."<br />
<br />
"Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"<br />
<br />
"Tell them you're too fucking stupid to own a computer!!"<br />

   <h2 style="margin:3px;"><a href="/fun/Computer/Words_From_Techsupport.html">Words From Techsupport</a></h2>
   </div><div>A Few Words From Tech Support<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound at all familiar??<br />
<br />
 1. Don't write anything down.  We can play back the error<br />
    messages from here.<br />
<br />
 2. When a tech says he's coming right over, go for coffee.<br />
    It's nothing to us to remember 481 screen saver passwords.<br />
<br />
 3. When you call us to have your computer moved, be sure to<br />
    leave it buried under half a ton of postcards, baby<br />
    pictures, stuffed animals, dried flowers, bowling trophies<br />
    and Popsicle art.  We don't have a life,  and we find it<br />
    deeply moving to catch a fleeting glimpse of yours.<br />
<br />
 4. When you call the help desk, state what you want, not<br />
    what's keeping you from getting it.  We don't need to know<br />
    that you can't get into your mail because your computer<br />
    won't power on at all.<br />
<br />
 5. Don't put your phone extension in your emails to the help desk.<br />
    We need to keep an eye on the address book performance.<br />
<br />
 6. When tech support sends you an email with high<br />
    importance, delete it at once.  We're just testing the<br />
    public groups.<br />
<br />
 7. When a tech is eating lunch in his cube, walk right in<br />
    and spill your guts right out.  We exist only to serve.<br />
<br />
 8. When a tech is having a smoke outside, ask him a computer<br />
    question. The only reason why we smoke at all is to ferret<br />
    out those clients who don't have email or a telephone line.<br />
<br />
 9. Send urgent email all in uppercase.  The mail server<br />
    picks it up and flags it as a rush delivery.<br />
<br />
10. When you call a tech's direct line, press 5 to skip the<br />
    bilingual greeting that says he's out of town for a week,<br />
    record your message and wait exactly 24 hours before you<br />
    send an email straight to the director because no one ever<br />
    returned your call.  After all, you're entitled to common courtesy.<br />
<br />
11. When the photocopier doesn't work, call computer support.<br />
    There's electronics in it.<br />
<br />
12. When you're getting a NO DIAL TONE message at home,<br />
    call computer support.  We can fix your line from here.<br />
<br />
13. When you have a dozen CGA monitors to get rid of,<br />
    call computer support.  We're collectors.<br />
<br />
14. When something's wrong with your home PC, dump it on<br />
    a tech's chair with no name, no phone number and no<br />
    description of the problem.   We love a puzzle.<br />
<br />
15. If you hate your mouse, get some other pointing device<br />
    and discard the manual.  We know all the keyboard accelerators.<br />
<br />
16. When a tech tells you that computer monitors don't have<br />
    cartridges in them, argue.  We love a good argument.<br />
<br />
17. When you get a message about insufficient disk space,<br />
    delete everything in the Windows directory.<br />
    It's nothing but trouble anyway.<br />
<br />
18. When you get a message about a hard disk controller<br />
    failure, and then you reboot and it looks okay, don't call<br />
    tech support.  We'd much rather troubleshoot it when it's<br />
    dead as a doornail.<br />
<br />
19. When you have a tech on the phone walking you through<br />
    changing a setting, read the paper.  We don't actually<br />
    mean for you to do anything.<br />
    We just love to hear ourselves talk.<br />
<br />
20. When a tech tells you that he'll be there shortly,<br />
    reply in a scathing tone of voice:<br />
    "And just how many weeks do you mean by shortly?"<br />
    That'll get us going.<br />
<br />
21. If you have a 14-inch monitor that says VGA on it, set<br />
    the display to true color, 1024 x 768.  You'll never again<br />
    have to worry about people reading confidential files over<br />
    your shoulder.<br />
<br />
22. When we offer training on the upcoming OS upgrade,<br />
    don't bother. We'll be there to hold your hand after it's done.<br />
<br />
23. When the printer won't print, re-send the job at least 20 times.<br />
    Print jobs frequently get sucked into black holes.<br />
<br />
24. When the printer still won't print after 20 tries,<br />
    send the job to all 68 printers in the building.<br />
    One of them is bound to work.<br />
<br />
25. Don't learn the proper name for anything technical.<br />
    We know exactly what you mean by "my thingy's outta whack".<br />
<br />
26. Don't use online help.  Online help is for wimps.<br />
<br />
27. If you're taking night classes in computer science,<br />
    feel free to go around and update the network drivers<br />
    for your all your co-workers.<br />
    We're grateful for the overtime money.<br />
<br />
28. When a tech makes popcorn, help yourself while he's<br />
    checking out your access rights.  And we keep chocolate<br />
    in the top drawer, too.<br />
<br />
29. When you have a tech fixing your computer at a quarter<br />
    past noon, eat your lunch in his face.<br />
    We function better when slightly dizzy.<br />
<br />
30. Don't ever thank us.  We're getting paid for this.<br />
<br />
31. If you're an intern, feel free to bring in all your<br />
    friends from college and have your Daddy complain to<br />
    our boss when we won't let them use the scanner.<br />
    We had no friends when we were in college; that's why<br />
    we're such a bunch of tight-assed little twerps.<br />
<br />
32. When a tech asks you whether you've installed any new<br />
    software on this computer, lie.  It's nobody's business<br />
    what you've got on your computer.<br />
<br />
33. When a tech finds the AOL shortcuts in your Recycle Bin,<br />
    tell him you've never seen those before.<br />
    We couldn't tell bullshit if it kicked us in the face.<br />
<br />
34. If you have NT, feel free to change the local<br />
    administrator's password to "blowjob" and promptly<br />
    forget it.<br />
    We like installing NT.<br />
<br />
35. If the mouse cable keeps knocking down the framed<br />
    picture of your dog, lift the computer and stuff the<br />
    cable under it.  Mouse cables were designed to have<br />
    45 lbs. of computer sitting on top of them.<br />
<br />
36. If the space bar on your keyboard doesn't work, blame it on<br />
    the mail upgrade.  Keyboards are actually very happy with<br />
    half a pound of muffin crumbs and nail clippings in them.<br />
<br />
37. When you receive the new Yanni CD for your birthday,<br />
    shove it into any slot on the front of your computer.<br />
    We like getting physical with 5.25 floppy drives.<br />
<br />
38. When you get a message saying "Are you sure?", click on<br />
    that Yes button as fast as you can.  Hell, if you weren't<br />
    sure, you wouldn't be doing it, would you?<br />
<br />
39. When you find a tech on the phone with his bank,<br />
    sit uninvited on the corner of his desk and stare<br />
    at him until he hangs up.<br />
    We don't have any money to speak of anyway.<br />
<br />
40. Feel perfectly free to say things like "I don't know<br />
    nothing about that computer crap".  We don't mind at<br />
    all hearing our area of professional expertise referred<br />
    to as crap.<br />
<br />
41. When you need to change the toner cartridge, call tech<br />
    support.  Changing a toner cartridge is an extremely<br />
    complex task, and Hewlett-Packard recommends that it<br />
    be performed only by a  professional engineer with a<br />
    master's degree in nuclear physics.<br />
<br />
42. When you can't find someone in the government directory,<br />
    call tech support.  Due to budget restrictions, we double as 411.<br />
<br />
43. When you have a lock to pick on an old file cabinet,<br />
    call tech support.  We love to hack.<br />
<br />
44. When something's the matter with your computer, ask your<br />
    secretary to call the help desk.  We enjoy the challenge<br />
    of having to deal with a third party who doesn't know<br />
    jack shit about the problem.<br />
<br />
45. When you receive a 30-meg movie file, send it to everyone<br />
    as a mail attachment.<br />
    We got lots of disk space on that mail server.<br />
<br />
46. Don't even think of breaking large print jobs down into<br />
    smaller chunks. Somebody else might get a chance to squeeze<br />
    a memo into the queue.<br />
<br />
47. When your eyes fall on the family pictures on a tech's desk,<br />
    exclaim in a flabbergasted tone of voice: "YOU have a child?!?"<br />
    We need to be reminded of how lucky we were to ever have gotten laid.<br />
<br />
48. When a tech gets on the elevator pushing 15,000 kilograms worth<br />
    of computer equipment on a cart, ask in a very loud voice:<br />
    "Good grief, you take the elevator to go DOWN one floor?!?"<br />
    That's another one that cracks us up no end.<br />
<br />
<br />
49. When the Finance folks are printing a 100-page spreadsheet<br />
    on the LaserJet, send your black and white print job to<br />
    the color printer. We get the black toner for free.<br />
<br />
50. When you lose your car keys, send an email to the entire department.<br />
    People out in Yellowknife like to keep abreast of what's going on.<br />
<br />
51. When you bump into a tech at the grocery store on a Saturday,<br />
    ask a computer question.  We don't do weekends.<br />
<br />
52. When you see a tech having a beer with a member of the<br />
    opposite sex on a Friday night, walk right up to them and<br />
    ask a computer question.  We don't do dating; the reason<br />
    why we have that horny look on our faces is because we're<br />
    discussing the new Intel processor.<br />
<br />
53. Don't bother to tell us when you move computers around<br />
    on your own. Computer names are just a cosmetic feature<br />
    in NT 4.0; they won't be doing anything useful until the<br />
    next major release.<br />
<br />
54. When you can't access some shared directory on your boss's<br />
    machine, just tell us that you've lost your X: drive.<br />
    We know all that shit by heart.<br />
<br />
55. If you need to buy a computer for your daughter in college,<br />
    feel free to pick our brains while we're taking a leak.<br />
    We're good at talking shop with our dicks in our hands.<br />
<br />
56. If your son is a student in computer science, have him<br />
    come in on the weekends and do his projects on your office<br />
    computer.  We'll be there for you when his illegal copy of<br />
    Visual Basic 6.0 makes your Access 95 database flip out.<br />
<br />
57. When you bring your own personal home PC for repair at<br />
    the office, leave the documentation at home.  We'll find<br />
    the jumper settings on the Internet.<br />
<br />
58. We're aware of that problem with computers just sitting<br />
    there and not doing anything.  We're confident that with<br />
    the next service pack they'll be able to dance the jig.<br />
<br />
59. The correct location to store important files is the<br />
    Recycle Bin.  It's just like a real office, where you<br />
    keep your tax receipts in the blue can under your desk.<br />
<br />
60. If you curse every morning when you start to type your<br />
    password and the Virus Shield splash screen pops up in<br />
    your face, disable the Virus Shield.<br />
    Again, this is just like real life: if you don't like<br />
    condoms, just don't use them, that's all.<br />
<br />
61. If you hate PCs, get on the Internet and download one of<br />
    those desktop enhancements that make your computer look<br />
    just like a Mac, down to the sad faces replacing verbose<br />
    error messages.  We find it refreshing to troubleshoot<br />
    the nuances in that sad little face instead of some cold<br />
    forbidding hexadecimal integer.<br />
<br />
62. When you detect a French accent in a tech's voice, switch<br />
    to French.  We don't mind that your level of fluency is<br />
    that of a mildly retarded 4-year-old; you don't make a<br />
    whole lot of sense in your own mother tongue either.<br />
<br />
63. We don't really believe that you're a bunch of ungrateful<br />
    twits.  It hurts our feelings that you could even think<br />
    such a thing.  We wish  to express our deepest gratitude<br />
    to the hundreds of clueless losers portrayed herein, <br />
    without whom none of this would have been remotely possible.<br />
<br />
64. Have you ever wondered what Tech Support does while you are on hold?<br />
    Think about how long it takes to write a 64 point memo!<br />

What's the buzzword for the bug <br />
That ends the century? <br />
  Y-2-K !  Y-2-K !  P-A-N-I-C! <br />
<br />
Come along, and join the throng <br />
and raid the grocery <br />
  D-I-S  T-U-R  B-A-N-C-E <br />
<br />
Beans and rice and spam (and guns!) <br />
Are all we need to be <br />
  S-U-R  V-I-V  A-L-I-S-T <br />
<br />
Your box won't boot, so join the suit <br />
against the industry: <br />
  M-A-L  P-R-A  C-T-I-C-E <br />
<br />
What will work and what will crash? <br />
It's all a mystery! <br />
  P-R-E  D-I-C  A-M-E-N-T <br />
<br />
No more water, gas, or cash <br />
or electricity <br />
  C-A-T  A-S-T  R-O-P-H-E <br />

and poor as it can be <br />
  A-P-O  C-A-L  Y-P-T-I-C <br />
<br />
Y2K (make a buck!), Y2K (make a buck!), <br />
Watch how consulting fees are raised up high! <br />
  High! High! High! <br />
<br />
How did this whole mess occur <br />
and bring such misery? <br />
  P-R-O (oh, sure, two digits is enough) <br />

<br />
Imagine waking up on January 1, 2000, to find that not only does your<br />
computer not work, but that your hairdo looks like something out of the<br />
1900's. This could destroy your ability to work and cause serious personal<br />
and financial upheaval. In order to avoid this potentially devastating<br />
scenario, the Fetal Baboon company has developed a Y2K Hair Spray.<br />
<br />
Andrei De'Ber, spokesman for Fetal Baboon, claims that their new Y2K Hair<br />
Spray will "make sure that your hair is Y2K compliant." Said De'Ber, "Your<br />
hair is incapable of telling what the date is. That is why there are still<br />
some men and women who have outdated hairstyles from the late sixties and<br />
early seventies. This has not been a problem because we are still in the<br />
20th century. However, when we enter the 21st century men and women who have<br />
non-Y2K compliant hairstyles could face serious troubles. If they don't do<br />
something now then their lives could be like Armageddon."<br />
<br />
Fetal Baboon's new Y2K Hair Spray will automatically 'download' a Y2K<br />
compliant hair style by simply spraying the product on to your existing<br />
hairdo. There is no mess and no worries. People who use this new Y2K Hair<br />
Spray will have the ability to enter the millennium with confidence.<br />
<br />
Y2K Hair Spray should be available in your local stores by mid-March.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Our staff has completed the 3 years of work on time and under<br />
budget.  We have gone through every line of code in every program in<br />
every system.  We have analyzed all databases, all data files,<br />
including backups and historic archives, and modified all data to<br />
reflect the change.  We are proud to report that we have completed<br />
the "Y-to-K" date change mission, and have now implemented all<br />
changes to all programs and all data to reflect the following new<br />
standards:<br />
 <br />
January, Februark, March, April, Mak, June, Julk, August, September,<br />
October, November, December<br />
 <br />
and...<br />
 <br />
Sundak, Mondak, Tuesdak, Wednesdak Thursdak, Fridak, Saturdak<br />
 <br />
I trust that this is satisfactory, because to be honest, none of this<br />
Y-to-K problem has made any sense to me.  But I understand it is a<br />
global problem, and our team is glad to help in any way possible.<br />
And what does the year 2000 have to do with it?  Speaking of which,<br />
what do you think we ought to do next year when the two digit year<br />
rolls over from 99 to 00?  We'll await your direction.<br />

<br />
<br />
Translated from Latin scroll dated 2BC<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Dear Cassius:<br />
 <br />
Are you still working on the Y zero K problem?  This change from BC to<br />
AD is giving us a lot of headaches and we haven't much time left.  I<br />
don't know how people will cope with working the wrong way around. <br />
Having been working happily downwards forever, now we have to start<br />
thinking upwards. You would think that someone would have thought of<br />
it earlier and not left it to us to sort it all out at this last minute.<br />
<br />
I spoke to Caesar the other evening.  He was livid that Julius hadn't<br />
done something about it when he was sorting out the calendar. He said<br />
he could see why Brutus turned nasty.  We called in Consultus, but he<br />
simply said that continuing downwards using minus BC won't work and as<br />
usual charged a fortune for doing nothing useful. Surely we will not<br />
have to throw out all our hardware and start again?  Macrohard will<br />
make yet another fortune out of this I suppose.<br />
 <br />
The money lenders are paranoid of course!  They have been told that<br />
all usury rates will invert and they will have to pay their clients to<br />
take out loans.  Its an ill wind ......<br />
<br />
As for myself, I just can't see the sand in an hourglass flowing<br />
upwards. We have heard that there are three wise men in the East who<br />
have been working on the problem, but unfortunately they won't arrive<br />
until it's all over.<br />
 <br />
I have heard that there are plans to stable all horses at midnight at<br />
the turn of the year as there are fears that they will stop and try to<br />
run backwards, causing immense damage to chariots and possible loss of<br />
life.<br />
 <br />
Some say the world will cease to exist at the moment of transition.<br />
Anyway, we are still continuing to work on this blasted Y zero K<br />
problem. I will send a parchment to you if anything further develops.<br />
<br />
If you have any ideas please let me know,<br />
 <br />
 Plutonius<br />

   </div><div>Day of Atonement E-Mail Prayer<br />
by Mark Frydenberg<br />
<br />
<br />
	On Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, we need to search our <br />
	hearts and recognize our wrongs (the hardest part!), then do all we <br />
	can to make amends to those we have wronged, and ask their forgivness.  <br />
	We then go to services and communally pray, asking the Higher Power <br />
	for insight, strength, and forgiveness.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by responding too often,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by not posting at all when we have something valuable to say;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by responding angrily in haste,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by posting private email in a public forum;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by misinterpreting others' words,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by not expressing ourselves clearly;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by being sarcastic to other list members,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by not being tolerant of their positions;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by not explaining technical terms,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by assuming others know as much as we do;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by posting announcements directly,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by posting subscription commands to the list;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by forwarding messages without introduction<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by cross-posting our own messages to many other lists;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by not using an appropriate subject line,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by having a long .signature file;<br />
	<br />
	For the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by quoting others' posts in their entirety,<br />
	And for the sin which we have committed<br />
	    by not providing context to our replies;<br />
	<br />
	For all of these, Forgiving One,<br />
	Forgive Us, Pardon Us, and Grant Us Atonement.<br />
