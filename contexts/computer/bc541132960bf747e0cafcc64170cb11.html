      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Enhanced Occupations Center is a computer training service business
      located at 1505 N. Fifth Street, Seattle, Washington. This business plan
      was developed for the purpose of a business loan in the amount of $71,500.
      Our projected sales for 2000 alone are $122,448 and our projected profits
      are over $30,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer training services, as shown in our plan, have an excellent
      profitability level and growth rate. Our competitive edge along with new
      training techniques puts EOC at the forefront of training services. We are
      living in an age where computer knowledge is a must and the market for
      computer training services is booming. Our training center will differ
      from the traditional computer training services (usually offered by
      colleges and universities) because of our added personal touch.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Objectives
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Enhanced Occupations Center (EOC) knows firsthand that computer
      training has to meet all of its customers&#x0027; needs in order to have a
      tangible lasting impact. When you measure across multiple customer
      segments&#x2014;each of which has its own priorities&#x2014;you see how
      much more training must do to consistently and simultaneously satisfy
      participants, managers, and executives. Training then can move to close
      those gaps and deliver more real value. Closing those gaps between
      employer skill needs and employee skills development is the main objective
      of EOC.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s other objectives are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To meet the computer training needs of computer users and area
        businesses by the way of Skill Assessment and Goal-Based Training.
      </li>
      <li>
        Retain new and current students through Step-Level Based computer
        training.
      </li>
      <li>
        Re-assess students upon completion of computer training to record skill
        level improvements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor outcomes of student completions after a 30-day period to track
        new employment or computer-related improvements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the computer training program as needed and according to
        outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to assess our own staff&#x0027;s computer training skill level
        and effectiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sales of $122,448 in 2000 and $200,192 by 2002.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Mission
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s mission is to understand what our students and businesses
      hope to achieve and dedicate our computer training and development to the
      fulfillment of those goals. The computer training we provide is
      contributing visibly and substantially to the fulfillment of our area
      business&#x0027;s strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC will maintain financial balance, charge a high value for our services,
      and deliver an even higher value to our clients. EOC will make computer
      user techniques accessible to hundreds of computer users who would
      otherwise not have the updated knowledge to use them. EOC will make a
      profit and generate cash. We will provide a rewarding work environment and
      fair compensation to our employees, ultimately provide excellent value to
      our customers and a fair return to our owners.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Keys to Success
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s keys to success include: implementing an effective cash flow
      plan, achieving efficiency, running our training like a business, and
      maintaining a serious business discipline to everything in our training.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s cash flow plan is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Maintain enough money on hand each month to pay the cash obligations the
        following month.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify and eliminate deficiencies or surpluses in cash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alter business financial plans to provide more cash if deficiencies are
        found.
      </li>
      <li>
        Invest any revealed excess cash in an accessible, interest bearing,
        low-risk account, such as a savings account or short-term CD or T-bill.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eliminate credit and terms to customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clearly understand the computer training market, distributions costs and
        competition, and continually adjusting accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep enough cash, as an added cushion for security, on hand to cover
        expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce accountant expenses by producing our own summary statistics and
        projections.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To achieve effectiveness EOC will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Link our training and development to business strategy by understanding
        what our customers hope to achieve and dedicating training and
        development to the fulfillment of those goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on business issues rather than training content by working
        tirelessly to offer training that matches new and emerging demands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let our customer demand shape our training and development offerings by
        providing a core curriculum designed to train individuals in basic
        skills and core competencies. We will also conduct ongoing needs
        assessments across the organization aimed at making training more
        strategic and providing training that has more business impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clarify our training and development business mission by avoiding trying
        to be all things to all people. EOC will offer more than training to
        develop employee skills. The training EOC will provide will also
        contribute&#x2014;visible and substantially&#x2014;to fulfillment of our
        customers&#x0027; business strategies.
      </li>
      <li>
        See training and development as an enterprise, not as a function by:
      </li>
      <li>
        1. Maintaining intense focus on our customers, their issues, and their
        needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Being systematic in our efforts to meet those needs efficiently,
        consistently, and reliably.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Daring to pursue missions that are linked to the business strategy
        and focused on business issues; willingly tackling big challenges, even
        those that are difficult and risky; being ambitious, alert, confident,
        and pragmatic.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To achieve cost efficiency EOC will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Expose hidden costs for businesses by allowing them to see their
        &#x0022;true&#x0022; training costs such as lost productivity, wasted
        training investments, or lost opportunity. Teaching these businesses how
        to measure training costs, and what they are getting back from their
        training.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aggressively reduce costs by eliminating duplication.&#x2022; Build and
        maintain reliable systems and processes by putting reliable training and
        development systems and processes in place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Operate as a variable cost, not a fixed expense, by understanding that
        customers spend only at their own initiative. Making training a variable
        cost makes especially good sense now that the pace of change in
        business&#x2014;and the resulting demands for learning&#x2014;are
        accelerating so dramatically. We found that there&#x0027;s no better
        stimulus to innovate, improve, and become more efficient than having to
        earn the right to serve customers, each and every day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be flexible and opportunistic in sourcing by strategically linking and
        focusing on business issues, allowing customers to consistently define

    <h2>
      COMPANY HISTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Enhanced Occupations Center (EOC) is a product of a similar computer
      training program developed and implemented by Serena Bolton, for the
      University of Washington Office of Community and Business Partnerships.
      The program was developed for the University of Washington to provide
      basic computer training to the North Seattle Community area residents and
      Peters school&#x0027;s Leadership Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The training was provided for four parents per session, two sessions per
      week for 15-20 sessions. Upon completion of the program the students will
      received a certificate. The sessions were made up of four core areas of
      Microsoft Office&#x00AE; training and those core areas were:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Word Processing
      </li>
      <li>
        Access Database
      </li>
      <li>
        Publisher 98
      </li>
      <li>
        Internet
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Serena learned from the project and the community that there is a growing
      need for computer training that is based on the student or
      employer&#x0027;s goals and skills assessment needs. After the four-month
      project ended, and for a year after the program, Serena analyzed,
      researched, and redeveloped the program based on those needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Enhanced Occupations Center differs from the University of Washington
      project to the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Training is based on skill assessment and goals
      </li>
      <li>
        Outcome of the training is monitored
      </li>
      <li>
        Microsoft Office User Specialist (MOUS) Testing is offered
      </li>
      <li>
        Students are retained through Step-Level program
      </li>
      <li>
        Training is re-evaluated continuously
      </li>
      <li>
        Other occupational programs will be implemented in conjunction with the
        computer training, such as the Secretarial Program
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      During her year of research and studies, Serena developed her knowledge
      base of curriculum development and delivery, return on investment for
      Technology-Based Training (TBT),
       training management systems, development teams for creating TBTs,
      ensuring transfer of learning to the job, leveraging technology for human
      performance improvement and computer training statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Serena was ready to bring all of the above components together, along
      with the communities&#x0027; needs, and package them into a plan for the
      birth of her vision. Basing the program on the same centralized idea,
      Microsoft Office&#x00AE; Training, Serena created the Enhanced Occupations
      Center.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computer training project developed for the Leadership Academy and
      AECC21, by Serena Bolton, has been maintained by the University of
      Washington Office of Community and Business Partnerships, and is taking
      place at the Maple Business Center in Seattle. After speaking with Martin
      Rawlins, Director of the Office, there is still a growing need for basic
      and advanced computer training. Martin has offered technical assistance
      and support to EOC and the assistance has been welcomed and accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC has also been approved by the Microsoft Office User Specialist Program
      to operate as an Authorized Test Center. This approval gives EOC full
      authorization to use the Microsoft Office&#x00AE; logo on our printed and
      televised materials. Microsoft will also provide the security of having
      MicroShare, a technical support team, available to EOC 24-hours a day.

      Service Description
    </h3>
    <p>
      We will provide core curriculum designed to train individuals from basic
      computer skills to certification competencies. Students will be retained
      through Step-Level Based Training indicated below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>
          Basic/Level 1
        </b>
        &#x2014;consists of students who have had little or no computer
        training.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Advanced/Level 2
        </b>
        &#x2014;consists of students who have had at-home or on-the-job
        experience with the majority of software packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Intermediate/Level 3
        </b>
        &#x2014;consists of certification training of students in preparation
        for the Microsoft Office User Specialist Certification Test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Microsoft Office User Specialist Program&#x2014;EOC is part of the
        MicroShare family of Authorized Test Centers (ATCs) that administer and
        offer assessment tests for the Microsoft Office&#x00AE; User Specialist
        (MOUS) program. About 90 percent of the Fortune 500 companies use
        Microsoft Office products. An ever-increasing number of individuals in
        these companies are looking for ways to give themselves a competitive
        edge to move up the career ladder.
      </li>
      <li>
        As an ATC, we have the opportunity to give our customers this
        competitive edge by helping them prove their expertise and skill in
        using Microsoft Office products. When passing or failing the test the
        student will receive a printout stating the results of the exam to take
        with them. If the student has passed the test, they will receive a
        Certification certificate in the mail 2-4 weeks later.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Microsoft Office User Specialist Certification Test
    </h4>
    <p>
      The test consists of actually taking the exam to be come a Microsoft
      Office User Specialist. This certification will give the student the
      credentials needed to prove that the student knows how to use Microsoft
      Office Applications efficiently and productively.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC believes that assessing a customer before and after a class will give
      us the real value of our training. EOC also will follow up 30 days after
      the training to see if the student actually retained what was learned and
      if the student was able to apply the skills in their current environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC also believes in assessing our own staff. We will conduct ongoing
      Skill Level Needs Assessments of our own employees across the Center,
      aimed at making computer training more strategic and providing computer
      training that has more of a business impact. We will continually seek to
      be effective for future student and business needs. Our key focus is to
      utilize our program outcomes to improve and increase our computer training
      effectiveness in the workplace.
    </p>
    <h4>
      EOC Company Assessment Program
    </h4>
    <p>
      EOC will provide an assessment service to local businesses as their
      pre-interviewing process. There will be a fee attached to this service.
      The assessment appointment will be by the company and they will give
      instructions as to our location, etc. EOC will only do business
      transactions with the company.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Training Schedule
    </h4>
    <p>
      The typical computer training class will run 2 hours, twice a week, for
      four weeks or a total of 16 hours of training. Our capacity for weekly
      classes, for one month, would be a total of 72 students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our workshops are one day, eight-hour classes. These classes are geared
      towards the individual wanting to brush up or learn a skill quickly
      without the long-term commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computer training classes will be scheduled as listed below. The
      specific subject of the class won&#x0027;t be established until we receive

    <h3>
      Competitive Comparison
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC differs from the traditional learning environments where the classes
      are large and sometimes overwhelming to new students. EOC believes that by
      having smaller classes (no more than 8 students) the trainer can be more
      attentive to the majority of the students&#x0027; needs. We focus on
      quality training, not quantity. Our fees are justified by the
      specialization of our personalized services.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Sales Literature
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once we learn the immediate needs of our typical customer, we can create
      our marketing literature to address these problems and our solutions to
      them, such as:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>
          Are you being turned down for jobs because you don&#x0027;t know
          Windows, Microsoft Word, or PowerPoint? If so, call the Enhanced
          Occupations Center at 643-1000 for personalized hands-on training in
          the most popular software packages.
        </i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      EOC will capitalize on the 80-20 rule and target low-maintenance customers
      that bring us the most revenues for the least effort. According to W.E.B.
      Business Consultants, 80 percent of computer training revenues come from
      20 percent of our customers. We will use a program for tracking customers,
      sales, and our time. And then we will focus our efforts on the best 20
      percent of our customers. We will target these people first and give them
      preferred status. EOC will then market our services to everyone else. We
      will &#x0022;weed out&#x0022; the customers that want to nickel and dime
      EOC, and make us rework a project over and over while they keep changing
      their minds about what they want.
    </p>

      The U.S. Census Bureau County Population report from 1998 states that the
      14 most common purposes of the computer being used at home are word
      processing, calendar/scheduling, e-mail, bookkeeping, customer records,
      inventory control, invoicing, sales/marketing, desktop publishing,
      graphics and design, analysis, programming, spreadsheets and databases.
      The number one main purpose for computer use is word processing. The
      number one software used for these applications is Microsoft Word.

      EOC will be focusing on new computer users and employed computer users
      that need to gain skills or update current skills. Our most important
      group of potential customers are those employed with high-technology
      businesses. These are entry-level employees or managers. We realize
      businesses do not want to waste their time or risk their money with
      training organizations that are fast paced with low skills retention
      outcomes.

      EOC has two marketing formulas in place and they are:
    </p>
    <h4>
      Formula #1
    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get a list of companies together that we think may need our services
        (such as new businesses from the County Clerk&#x0027;s office or the 
        <i>
          Seattle Journal
        </i>
        ).
      </li>
      <li>
        Call these people and find out the contact person and if they need our
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mail a letter, brochure, and card to the interested companies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow-up with another call to the contact person.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to call these people periodically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep good records of companies and contact logs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get a list of companies together that we think may need our services
        (such as new businesses from the County Clerk&#x0027;s office or the 
        <i>
          Seattle Journal
        </i>
        ).
      </li>
      <li>
        Call these people and find out the contact person and if they need our
        services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask them if they would like a FREE subscription to our computer
        newsletter that we will fax them periodically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fax the newsletter to those who are interested, and include mail
        enrollment information as well. Mail information to those people who
        don&#x0027;t want newsletters but are still interested in our services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow-up in a week to see what they thought and if we can help them
        with anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to send our fax newsletter regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep good records of contacts and logs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      Other Strategies:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Join America&#x0027;s Learning Exchange resource database that will
        promote our training to employers, workers, and life-long learners via
        the Internet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create alliances with grassroots organizations and staffing
        organizations.

        opportunities to gather referrals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contact students from previous classes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Market Needs
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our target market is very dependent on reliable information technology.
      They use the computers for a complete range of functions, beginning with
      core administration information such as accounting, shipping, and
      inventory. They also use computers for communications within the business
      and outside the business, and for personal productivity. The businesses
      are not, however, large enough to have dedicated computer training
      personnel such as the MIS departments in large businesses. Ideally, they
      come to us for a long-term alliance, looking for reliable training service
      and support to substitute for the lack of their in-house trainer. These
      are not businesses that want to shop for rock-bottom prices. They want to
      have reliable providers of training expertise.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Market Trends
    </h3>
    <p>
      One important trend is that we live in an age where one-stop shopping is
      the preferred purchasing method. All you need to do is head down to your
      local Wal-Mart Supercenter for a 31-inch television, diapers, and a gallon
      of milk, while you simultaneously let them rotate your tires and have your
      hair done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the technical professional has a similar resource. With the growing
      popularity of the Microsoft Office User Specialist Certification and use
      of Microsoft Office products, EOC is offering students the
      &#x0022;one-stop-shop computer training and certification&#x0022;
      approach. A student will no longer have to go from one seminar to another,
      or from one instructor&#x0027;s methods to another. At EOC students can
      begin at the basic level of instruction and follow through all the way to
      certification, without going through the added stress of familiarizing
      themselves all over again.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Market Growth and Industry
    </h3>
    <p>
      According to the America&#x0027;s Career Infonet Report, the top three
      fastest growing occupations in Washington are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Computer Engineers&#x2014;102 percent increase forecast between 1994 and
        2005.

        Electronic pagination system operators&#x2014;80 percent increase
        between 1994 and 2005.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Listed below are the occupations with the largest number of projected
      openings in Washington during the 1994-2005 time period.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>

      <li>
        Systems analysts, electronic data processing
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All of the above occupations will require computer knowledge or computer
      training from their candidates.
    </p>

      By the year 2002, almost every household will have a computer and almost
      all businesses will be utilizing a computer for one reason or another.
      Computer training will no longer be a choice&#x2014;it will be a
      requirement. EOC will be in place and established, already serving the
      training needs of employment candidates and businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among industries, computer use was most common in finance, insurance, and
      real estate, where 2 in 3 workers used them. According to 
      <i>
        Training Magazine
      </i>
      &#x0027;s 1999 Industry Report in 1999, training budgets crept up to $62.5
      billion. Of that sum, $15 billion will go to outside providers of training
      products and services. Of all formal training 33 percent will be devoted
      to teaching computer skills. Of all computer-skills training, 74 percent
      of the training will be delivered in a classroom by a live instructor.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Competition and Buying Patterns
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s main competitors could be considered local colleges,
      universities, and continuing education providers, but in reality they are
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sense, these &#x0022;competitors&#x0022; actually welcome computer
      training companies who cater to the smaller class sizes and novice
      computer users. It gives them the opportunity to cut back on waiting lists
      and also expedite their schedules, increasing the quantity and decreasing
      the quality. Computer Training companies rank second in selected training
      sources organizations choose to utilize.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC has heard time and time again, from students who have withdrawn from
      educational institutions because the classes are &#x0022;too large and
      move too quickly through the materials.&#x0022; These students want and
      need computer training classes that are small and Skill Level Based
      oriented. The students also want improved teaching methods outside the
      traditional lecture learning style. They seek retention of skills learned.
      They want hands-on learning and they want to be able to go home or to work
      and begin using their new skills right away. Here are some other reasons
      that people will want to come to EOC for training:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        They have specific projects they want to create and their training will
        be learning- specific.
      </li>
      <li>
        They only need to learn a few things about a program and do not need a
        full course.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their schedule varies and they need a flexible training schedule.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are in a hurry. They do not have time to fit in a class at the
        local university or college. They want to be trained now!
      </li>
      <li>
        They are nervous in large groups or formal education facilities and want
        a more relaxed learning environment such as our Center.
      </li>
      <li>
        They feel like they are slow learners and would be more comfortable in a
        Center environment.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      According to the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD),
      &#x0022;leading edge companies are responding to the need of skilled
      employees by providing more training (usually outsourced) because it makes
      sense from both a business standpoint and from a recruitment
      standpoint,&#x0022; said Laurie Bassi, ASTD Vice President of Research.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge need for skilled employees is being driven by technology and
      companies are scrambling to meet the technological requirements of their
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1999 State of Industry report found that most firms increased the
      amount of money they spent on employees by about $150 per employee from
      1996 to 1997, but that the leading edge firms surveyed doubled that with
      an average increase of $300 per employee. Typical total expenditures for
      training grew from $1.4 million in 1996 to $2 million in 1997 for average
      firms, and leading edge firms increased spending from $3.4 million to $4.1
      million in the same period. Projected expenditures for 1998 show that the
      gap between the average firm and leading edge firms will continue to
      widen, with industry average increasing to $2.1 million while leading edge
      firms are projected to spend $4.7 million on training.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASTD has found that companies that invest the most in workplace learning
      find higher net sales per employee, higher gross profits per employee, and
      a higher ratio in market-to-book values, compared with companies who
      invest less in workplace learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information technology and transportation/public utility sectors spent
      the most on training ($3.9 million and $3.8 million respectively) and
      these sectors also led in terms of money spent per employee on training
      ($1,004 per employee and $943 per employee respectively).
    </p>
    <p>
      Outsourcing of training grew by 20 percent, from $461,000 per firm in 1996
      to $513,000 in 1997, and was predicted to grow to $522,000 in 1998.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1998 job-specific technical skills (including the use of technology)
      were the most frequent kinds of training delivered (17%), followed by
      management and supervisor training (12%), computer literacy and
      applications training (12%). Bringing up the rear was executive
      development (4%) and basic skills (2%), all which were up from 1996.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of learning technologies in training was on the rise&#x2014;with
      an increase of 50 percent&#x2014; but was still relatively low overall.
    </p>
    <p>
      After carefully researching the computer training market, it has been
      discovered that some students are more concerned with how you train than
      with what you are training, even though the two concepts are equally
      important. EOC focuses on customer care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest Microsoft Office User Specialist testing center is in Redmond.
      EOC will be the first in MOUS Training Center to make its presence in
      Seattle. This groundbreaking opportunity gives EOC time to establish and
      maintain ongoing relationships with area businesses and students to gain
      their loyalty should another center open in Seattle. The key element in
      purchase decisions made at the EOC client level is trust in the
      professional reputation and reliability of the training center.

    <h2>
      BUSINESS STRATEGY &#x0026; IMPLEMENTATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      We develop marketing materials based on the symptoms of our customers and
      then we coordinate those materials to focus on solving the typical
      customer&#x0027;s symptoms. We will then obtain lists of people that fit
      our typical customer&#x0027;s characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our business strategy is to develop a list of people that would most
      likely exhibit the &#x0022;symptoms&#x0022; we have determined our typical
      customer would have. Once we have our list we will consistently approach
      them about our services.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way of approaching our prospects would be the Letter-Series Method.
      The Letter-Series Method consists of sending our prospects a series of
      four different professionally written letters (1 per week) before we ever
      call them. The letters would be personal, meaning the letter would state
      &#x0022;Dear Mr. Smith&#x0022; instead of &#x0022;Dear Prospective
      Customer.&#x0022; By sending customers four letters we will establish EOC
      in their minds as a professional, persistent business entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters will be written in advance. They will cover a different topic
      each time. They will contain computer hints or a copy of our newsletter.
      We won&#x0027;t try to push or sell in these letters.
       By the fourth letter, they will know that we intend to call them. We will
      make sure we do call them when we say we will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the possible structure for our four letters:
    </p>
    <h3>
      Letter one
    </h3>
    <p>
      Introduce ourselves and our philosophy. Build trust. Don&#x0027;t try to
      sell in this letter. Go over our attitudes, specialty, history,
      qualifications, and philosophy. It will be like a resume to introduce EOC.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Letter two
    </h3>
    <p>
      Introduce our company.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Letter three
    </h3>
    <p>
      Cover a topic we feel may interest the prospect based on our knowledge of
      their &#x0022;symptoms&#x0022; and characteristics.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Letter four
    </h3>
    <p>
      Cover another topic we feel may interest them and let them know we will be
      calling on a specific day/time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will then create reminder and follow-up letters as well. These letters
      will include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Appointment reminder
      </li>
      <li>
        Thank you for the appointment
      </li>
      <li>
        Broken appointment/no show&#x2014;will call back later
      </li>
      <li>
        Thank you for your business
      </li>
      <li>
        Thank you for your referral
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      EOC will make it a point to sign and hand-address our envelopes. We
      believe this will significantly increase the probability of our letters
      being opened. And an individually signed letter is much more personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth week, we will call to make an appointment to come in and talk
      with the prospect. We will have a written telephone script before we start
      calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Harvard Business School study indicates that it &#x0022;takes five
      contacts from an unknown company to an individual before he or she will
      feel comfortable enough to do business with the company.&#x0022; We will
      start with 350 or more prospects. We won&#x0027;t mail them all at once.
      We will stagger the mailing so that we will be able to contact them
      personally after they have received their fourth letter. This will be our
      initial implementation of the business, along with our current waiting
      list of students.
    </p>
    <p>
      That list includes:

      Once our students respond to our advertisements or referrals, they will
      enter into our pre- registration process. Once they have submitted their
      registration form/agreement letter and payment, they will be invited to
      the orientation and skill assessment. After they have been assessed they
      will be placed in a basic beginner&#x0027;s, advanced, or intermediate
      class&#x2014; whichever meets their training needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After students complete their level they will be assessed and an outcome
      report will be written. Each student will be evaluated after each level
      they pass. The student will then again be placed. Once the student has
      completed all of the levels, or does not want to go any further, they will
      have a closing assessment. Each student will receive technical support for
      30 days after which they will be contacted and a follow-up report will be
      done on the skills they have learned and the skills they use.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Competitive Edge
    </h3>
    <p>
      We will start with a critical competitive edge: there is no local
      competitor we know of that offers the MOUS Certification testing, small
      retention based classes, or individual student attention. Most of the
      local training facilities are not flexible to students&#x0027; needs. Our
      positioning on this point is very hard to match, but only if we maintain
      this focus in our strategy, marketing, business development, and
      fulfillment. We should be aware that the tendency to dilute this personal
      touch, with larger classes that require longer student commitment, could
      weaken the importance of our competitive edge.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Marketing Strategy
    </h3>
    <p>
      Marketing in a high-end computer training business depends on recognition
      for expertise. It starts with our known contacts in positions to recommend
      us, and continues with long-term efforts to develop recognition in
      professional forums.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will develop and maintain a database of people in the right positions.
      It starts with contacts we bring in as we start the business. From there
      we add enquiries and participants in forums and seminars, and newsletter
      subscribers. We use the database to make regular contact with mailings for
      additional forums and seminars.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Pricing Strategy
    </h3>
    <p>
      Seattle Community College&#x0027;s Continuing Education offers similar
      courses to EOC. Seattle prices its computer classes at $119 for 5-8 hours
      of training and $20 for the book. We will follow suit but market our
      classes at $125 for the class and $20 for the book. We can ask for more
      because our classes are smaller and we are able to give more
      individualized attention to our students. We also are able to give
      discounts on some of our manuals because we manufacture them ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The going rate for private training is between $25-$60 per hour depending
      on what is being taught. For businesses the rate is between $40-45 per
      hour for on-site training of 1-2 students, with a minimum of a two-hour
      visit. If people are going to have a large group trained at their
      location, we would charge a per person rate instead of an hourly one. For
      an 8-hour course, we would charge $300 for the first two students, and
      $110 for each additional student. Our fees will be set to cover a
      reference book, training, and 60 days of follow-up phone support.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the periodic Computer Upgrading workshops, a two-hour class, the fee
      will be $49 per person, and includes a copy of &#x0022;How to buy the
      right computer.&#x0022;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the periodic Basic Four workshops, a one-day or eight-hour class, the
      fee will be $179 per person, and includes a workbook, copies of
      &#x0022;How to buy the right computer&#x0022; and &#x0022;The
      Beginner&#x0027;s Inspirational Guide to Computer Tips and
      Shortcuts,&#x0022; and a light lunch.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Promotion Strategy
    </h3>
    <p>
      The biggest mistake that computer-based business owners make is using a
      shotgun versus a laser beam approach to their business. Most of us in the
      computer industry have a tendency to be good at many different computer
      tasks. We might be good at desktop publishing, recommending software,
      customizing software, and doing basic PC repair. We might think that
      because we are good at all of these things we should do them all. We will
      have a broader customer base. We can service more people and thus should
      make more money.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems like the logical conclusion, but in reality it does not work.
      We spread ourselves to thin. At EOC we believe the more specific you get
      about what you do and who you do it for, the easier our service is to
      sell. We are working with a laser beam approach when we focus in this way.
      A laser beam is concentrated and works in a powerful way. We believe in
      focusing on one aspect of the computer industry for a specific type of
      client. In doing this we become three things: 1) a specialist, 2) known as
      an expert in our field, 3) all our marketing efforts fall into place, 4)
      we minimize, if not eliminate, much of our competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we do not want to grow too fast, our main form of promotional
      strategy in the beginning will be word of mouth and referrals.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Distribution Strategy
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s delivery method will have a large bearing on how we develop
      our program, so we have given this process up-front consideration. We have
      chosen to use the learning center method to deliver our training.
    </p>
    <p>
      The training distribution will begin with first completing a needs
      assessment on the customer. Once the customer has been assessed they will
      be placed in a class that meets their assessment needs. Once the customer
      completes the class, they will again be assessed and go through an outcome
      procedure. The customer then has the choice of going up to the next level.
      If a customer chooses to dropout, they can return and be tested and placed
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following distribution tools will be used to aid in our classroom
      delivery:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Printed material
      </li>
      <li>
        Instructor-led classroom presentation
      </li>
      <li>
        CD-ROM
      </li>
      <li>
        Internet
      </li>
      <li>
        Professional Speakers
      </li>
      <li>
        Tours/Field Trips
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our goal, in the near future, is to implement a Distributed Learning
      Framework (DLF). A webenabled DLF can be accessed by users in a consistent
      and convenient manner from any location on the Internet. The DLF would
      manage other application data such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Registration
      </li>
      <li>
        Users
      </li>
      <li>
        Learners Profiles
      </li>
      <li>
        Schedules
      </li>
      <li>
        Progress and Performance data
      </li>
      <li>
        Discussion Forums
      </li>
      <li>
        E-mail
      </li>
      <li>
        Surveys
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The benefits of this approach would be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Accessibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Extensibility
      </li>
      <li>
        Reusability
      </li>
      <li>
        Interoperability
      </li>
      <li>
        Durability
      </li>
    </ul>

      In the future, learning frameworks will evolve to embrace new technologies
      such as electronic commerce and knowledge management best practices to
      solve business issues such as skill gaps, corporate virtual campuses,
      career development, and help desks. Distributed learning frameworks also
      will link to enterprise resource planning, human resources, and financial
      systems.

    <h3>
      Training Strategy
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC will use the accelerated-learning theory called the multiple
      intelligences theory. This theory was developed by the Harvard
      psychologist Howard Gardner and his team of researchers at the Graduate
      School of Education. What Gardner and his team put forth is the fact that
      there is no single way in which everyone thinks and learns. Instead, there
      are many forms of intelligence, many ways by which people learn,
      understand, think, problem-solve, and relate to the world. Gardner
      proposed a system of eight distinct intelligences. EOC will incorporate
      activities into our computer training program that exercises all eight of
      these intelligences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In brief, here are Gardner&#x0027;s eight multiple intelligences:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Verbal-linguistic&#x2014;(speaking, reading, writing). This intelligence
        shows up in writers, storytellers, lawyers, politicians, and television
        talk-show hosts. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: group discussions.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Logical-mathematical&#x2014;(scientific reasoning). Obvious possessors
        are scientists, statisticians, and computer programmers. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: calculations and other math
          operations.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Visual-spatial&#x2014;(visualizing through lines, shape, volume, etc.).
        Think of architects, graphic designers, painters, decorators, film
        directors, chess players, engineers, and sculptors are examples of this
        type of brilliance. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: charts, graphs, and
          PowerPoint presentations.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bodily-kinesthetic&#x2014;(control and interpretation of muscular or
        physical sensations). Geniuses here may be actors, athletes, dancers,
        physical therapists, mechanics, carpenters, jewelers, and craftspeople. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: Hands-on learning and
          stretching breaks.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Musical-rhythmic&#x2014;(recognize and use rhythmic and tonal patterns).
        Musicians, disc jockeys, and studio engineers and those who learn best
        when music is playing. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: Using soft music in the
          background.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Interpersonal&#x2014;(ability to work cooperatively with others). This
        form of intelligence is highly developed in teachers, therapists,
        managers, salespeople, public relations, and religious leaders. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: paired sharing, interactive
          games and exercises, group and peer teaching.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Intrapersonal&#x2014;(self-smart). This intelligence shows up in
        theologians, entrepreneurs, philosophers, and therapists. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: self-esteem activities,
          self-paced learning, and individualized instruction.
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Naturalistic&#x2014;(nature-smart). This intelligence likes animals and
        organic systems better than people. 
        <b>
          EOC training incorporation will include: Field trips and time
          outdoors.
        </b>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      Instruction Method
    </h4>
    <p>
      All training programs have four major ingredients: information,
      performance outcomes, instructional methods, and instructional media. EOC
      will carefully account for and include each of these ingredients in our
      instructional methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      All courses will include information to be trained. Course information can
      be classified as one of five types: facts, concepts, processes,
      procedures, and principles. The information will be decided by both
      looking at the knowledge and skill requirements of the job and the
      knowledge and skill level of the intended audience. Subtracting the
      knowledge and skills of the intended audience from those of the job, EOC
      will be able to derive final course content.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s performance outcome will be a clearly defined statement of
      what the learners will be doing when they have achieved the purpose of the
      course or lesson. The performance outcomes will be mirrored with what must
      be done on the job. They are then written in the form of learning
      objectives. For each of our lessons we have at least one major learning
      objective and many will include supporting objectives as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructional methods are two types: informational displays and practice
      exercises with feedback. EOC will mainly use the practice exercise with
      feedback method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our instructional methods will be delivered through a mix of media that
      include: instructor, computer, workbook, overhead transparencies,
      flipchart, and perhaps a video.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC is obliged to offer training that works in today&#x0027;s society.
      While the modern employees are the best-educated in history, they are
      still required to absorb tremendous amounts of information and apply vast
      amounts of knowledge. EOC will use every theory, tool, and technique that
      will help employees learn while unleashing every available type of
      intelligence, gift, and aspect of humanity at their disposal.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Marketing Programs
    </h3>
    <p>
      The letters, brochures, business cards, flyers, and other literature will
      act as our representative. Here are some of our marketing programs and

      <li>
        Add a P.S.&#x2014;This is the second most read part of the letter. The

      Customer loyalty is much more important to EOC than customer satisfaction.
      We will serve our customers so well they will brag about EOC to others.
      This will keep them loyal and also provides a continual flow of customers.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Self-Evaluation Program
    </h4>
    <p>
      We will maintain our customers&#x0027; happiness by utilizing our
      Self-Evaluation Program in which we will continually ask ourselves these
      following questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Is EOC&#x0027;s service the best it can be?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the appearance of our trainers, business surroundings, and product
        packaging professional?
      </li>
      <li>
        Can we clearly describe our business in 25 words or less? Can our
        customers describe our business in 25 words or less?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do our customers know about all of our products and services?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we have a well-developed marketing plan that we follow on a
        consistent basis?
      </li>
      <li>
        What if our marketing plans work? Will we be able to handle the
        increased volume of sales without harming our customers or the quality
        of our work product?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we treat others with honesty and respect at all times?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      EOC will continue to listen to ours customers and stay in regular contact
      with our customers by offering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Workshops and seminars.
      </li>
      <li>
        Private sales or classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Giving them informative newsletters, articles, or tip sheets that can
        help them in their businesses, such as a computer tips and tricks
        newsletter.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      EOC also will have a program in place for dropping customers who meet the
      following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They complain about our prices and are always trying to get us to cut
        our rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        They complain about our competitors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clients who miss appointments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clients who can&#x0027;t make up their mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clients who hover over us while we work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clients who owe us money or keep saying they&#x0027;ll pay us
        &#x0022;when their funding comes in.&#x0022;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Sales Strategy
    </h3>
    <p>
      EOC&#x0027;s sales strategy is to get people to talk about
      themselves&#x2014;their wants, desires, needs, and fears. Then use the
      information to help make a sale. Our sales goal is to remember why people
      buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of people buy on emotion and justify their decision with
      facts and reason. They may buy for power, prestige, security, happiness,
      or freedom. EOC&#x0027;s service will appeal to these basic emotional
      needs first. After the prospect decides to buy our service for an
      emotional reason, they will be given facts by EOC to back up their
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC will establish trust and rapport with all of our prospective
      customers. We also will be prepared or anticipate objections. With those
      objections, we will make a list, learn from them and then come up with the
      answers to them. EOC will review the list of objections and possible
      solutions frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC will have quantitative, reasonable sales goals by asking ourselves the
      following questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What is our net profits per sale?
      </li>
      <li>
        What was our business activity over the last 12 months?
      </li>
      <li>
        How did last year&#x0027;s activity compare to the year before? Did you
        show an increase or decrease in sales? By what percent?
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the lifetime value of a customer? How much will our average
        customer buy over the months or years that they stay with us?
      </li>
      <li>
        How much of this is profit? What is the net profit/customer over the
        life of the customer?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will also research our past and decide what is working and what is not.
      Based on our past performance we will decide on a goal that is attainable.
      We will then work backwards from our goal to decide what we will have to
      do to reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC sales concentration will also be focused on reversing the risk from
      our customers to our Center by offering guaranteed learning. If at the end
      of a course students don&#x0027;t feel like they have learned what was
      covered in class, we will work with them at no additional charge until
      they are comfortable with the material.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC believes that being in the right place at the right time is 50 percent
      of obtaining a successful sale. Product knowledge is 25 percent and the
      last 25 percent is our human relations skills. Being very knowledgeable
      and extremely helpful are the ingredients to a successful sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listed are some valuable secrets we have learned:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be out there&#x2014;Be in as many places as possible. Look as big as we
        possibly can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be free with our knowledge&#x2014;Give prospects a &#x0022;taste&#x0022;
        of what we know without expectations of reimbursement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Look for long-term alliances in every situation&#x2014;Don&#x0027;t be
        satisfied with just one sale. Learn from experiences and successes of
        others. Continually look for ways we can ride the coattails of
        others&#x0027; successes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be helpful and friendly&#x2014;Being free with our knowledge, without an
        invoice, gets people &#x0022;hooked&#x0022; on our organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        People do business with people, not with companies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask customers why they choose EOC&#x2014;Learn what we did right and
        repeat it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes having too many customers can be bad for business. Raising rates
      through a letter can serve three purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It helps to get rid of deadwood customers. They don&#x0027;t call
        anymore because they can&#x0027;t afford the rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        The trainer can work less and earn more.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is a great opportunity to reiterate all of our services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, it is our goal to deliver more than what we promise and never
      build up hopes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Sales Forecast
    </h3>
    <p>
      The peaks and valleys for this business in the U.S. are from about
      September 6 through November 22. For some reason people think
      &#x0022;school&#x0022; in the fall, and they take more classes. Two of our
      worst times are from November 22 through January 7 and the month of March.
      Obviously, the holidays are getting in the way from November 22 through
      January 7. People are too busy with taxes in March, but it will pick up in
      April and May as people file their tax returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&#x0027;s during our &#x0022;valley&#x0022; periods that we will
      concentrate on a saturation of workshops and seminars, where no long-term
      commitment is required of the customer. We will also do holiday specials.
      For everyone who has inquired about our classes during the year, we will
      do a mailing around November 5 and offer them a really good deal on
      training during our &#x0022;valley&#x0022; period.

    <h3>
      Turning Points
    </h3>
    <p>
      Seattle, Washington is at a business industry turning point. With Boeing
      being phased out as the number one employer, people are scrambling to
      adjust their skills. Those employees that have been laid off or bought out
      are finding the world outside is not what it used to be before they
      entered Boeing. Those employees are now finding their skills to be
      outdated or unusable in the workforce today.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lack the computer skills needed to become employable once again. They
      are also finding that more and more certifications are now being required
      criteria for employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC is strategically positioning itself to be in place for these workers
      and others that are in need of basic computer training. EOC is also
      positioning itself to meet the needs of employers who are requesting
      advanced training and certifications. EOC will be the gap filler between
      the employer and the employee.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOC knows that no business is without frustrations and disappointments.
      Yet, we strive to know what to expect in advance, so we are better
      prepared to deal with the built-in frustrations of this business. We
      expect a certain amount of &#x0022;no shows.&#x0022; This is why we
      require payment up front as a guarantee of attendance. We know that about
      1 out of every 5 people who sign up could possibly back out due to
      sickness, emergencies, and sometimes people just change their mind. In
      this case we make sure we do not spend our money before it has cleared.
    </p>

      FINANCIAL PLAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      We want to finance growth mainly through cash flow. We recognize that this
      means we will have to grow more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important factor in our case is sales. We will develop a
      permanent system with ongoing marketing and sales development.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are also assuming an initial short-term loan of $71,500 which includes
      start-up capital of $15,000.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Important Assumptions
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our financial plan depends on important assumptions, most of which are
      shown in the following table as annual assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the more important underlying assumptions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We assume a strong economy, without major recession.
      </li>
      <li>
        We assume, of course, that there are no unforseen changes in technology
        to make the use of computers and the need of computer training obsolete.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Projected Profit and Loss
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our projected profit and loss is shown on the following table, with sales
      increasing more than 30 percent. We show a break-even profit the first
      year. We prefer to project conservatively so that we make sure we have
      enough cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detailed monthly projections are included in appendices.
