<div class="content clearfix"> <strong> Andrus, Jules</strong> <br />
    From 1955 to 1957, Andrus worked with Walter L. Bond at Bell Labs on applying the photoengraving techniques used in making printed circuits to adapt photolithography to silicon processing. In this approach, photoactive chemicals called “photoresists” deposited on the silicon-dioxide surface layer are used in a photographic process to define precision openings in the layer through which impurities are diffused into the underlying silicon, thus establishing the required electrical properties there. Andrus was awarded a patent on this technique in 1964.

  <div class="content clearfix"> <strong> Atalla, Martin M. (“John”)</strong> <br />
    Born in Port Said, Egypt, Atalla earned master’s and doctor’s degrees in mechanical engineering at Purdue University, the latter in 1949, before beginning work at Bell Labs. There he did pioneering research on the silicon-dioxide layer, which serves as a protective coating on semiconductor silicon. This research led to the development in 1960 of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (or MOS) transistor with Dawon Kahng. The MOS transistor has since become the central active component of semiconductor memories and microprocessors; millions of them can be found on every microchip made today. After leaving Bell Labs, Atalla co-founded Hewlett-Packard Associates to provide the Hewlett-Packard Corporation with solid-state capabilities. In 1973 he founded his own company, the Atalla Corporation, to address the security requirements of banking and financial institutions.

It permits precision control of the thickness of these layers and their impurity concentrations. Fuller’s impurity-diffusion process allowed the manufacture of high-speed transistors in the late 1950s and silicon integrated circuits beginning in the 1960s. To this day it remains a crucial processing technique used throughout the semiconductor industry.

<div class="content clearfix"> <strong> Welker, Heinrich </strong> (September 9, 1912 — December 25, 1981)<br/>
A German theoretical and applied physicist, Heinrich Welker was one of the most important European contributors to semiconductor science and technology. He earned his PhD in physics at the University of Munich in 1936 and worked on germanium processing in the German radar program during World War II. After the war he worked with Herbert Mataré at a subsidiary of Westinghouse in a Paris suburb to manufacture germanium diodes for military and communications applications. In mid-1948 they invented a three-contact semiconductor amplifier based on germanium that was similar to Bardeen and Brattain’s point-contact transistor. The following year they announced the device, dubbed the “transistron,” and put it into limited production. Welker joined Siemens-Schuckert in 1951, leading its solid-state physics department. There he pioneered the science and technology of gallium arsenide and other similar compound semiconductors for microwave and optoelectronic applications. During the 1960s he became director of all the company’s research operations.

<div class="content clearfix"> <strong> Widlar, Robert </strong> (November, 1937-February 27, 1991)<br/>
Robert (Bob) J. Widlar was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. On entering the Air Force in 1958 as a technical instructor he began taking courses through the University of Colorado at Boulder and graduated with a BS in electrical engineering in 1962. Widlar worked for a year at Ball Brothers, Boulder, CO and in 1963 joined Fairchild Semiconductor where as a linear integrated circuit designer he established a working relationship with process engineer David Talbert that resulted in the industry’s first commercially successful linear devices. With Talbert he moved to Molectro Science Corporation in 1965 that was acquired by National Semiconductor in 1966. Working at National until 1970, he contributed many additional highly successful linear circuit designs. Widlar then moved to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico where he continued to design innovative products as an independent contractor for both National and Linear Technology until his death. In addition to his legacy as a designer, he is remembered for his hard-drinking and high-spirited antics frequently aimed at corporate bureaucracy.

Alan Herris Wilson graduated from Cambridge University, England in 1926 and spent from 1926 to 1940 engaged in research in quantum theory at Cambridge. He visited Werner Heisenberg’s institute in Leipzig, Germany in 1931 where he developed one of the first models of semiconductor behavior. His papers on “The Theory of Electronic Semi-Conductors” influenced researchers at Bell Labs and Purdue University. Following World War II radio communications work he  joined Courtaulds Ltd. as Director of Research and Development. In July 1962 he became a director of ICT (International Computers and Tabulators) and played a major role in the development of the British computer industry. Wilson joined the Board of Glaxo Group in January 1963, became Chairman the same year and remained until his retirement in 1973. Throughout his career Wilson had a wide record of public service - particularly in the area of encouraging scientific teaching and research.
