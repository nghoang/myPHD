<h3 class="date">March 12, 2007</h3> 

<p>
If you&#39;re ever in Silicon Valley, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>. Where else can you see a live demonstration of <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/">the only known working PDP-1 in existence</a>, and actually get to <i>play the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!">Spacewar</a> on it?</i> I did. It was incredible. I got chills. And my wife was bored beyond belief, but I love her all the more for soldiering through.
<p>
Beyond the special exhibits, the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/virtualvisiblestorage/home.html">Visible Storage area</a> is where the real action is at in the museum. It takes up the majority of the floor space, and it contains every computer I&#39;ve ever heard of. Among the artifacts in visible storage is one of <b>Google&#39;s original servers from 1999</b>:
<p>
<a href="http://nomano.shiwaza.com/tnoma/blog/archives/002379.html"><img alt="Google Server at the Computer History Museum, rack from afar" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777004a4970c" height="451" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777004a4970c-pi" width="216" /></a>
&#0160;
<a href="http://nomano.shiwaza.com/tnoma/blog/archives/002379.html"><img alt="Google Server at the Computer History Museum, closeup of rack" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777004bd970c" height="399" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777004bd970c-pi" width="600" /></a>
<p>
<a href="http://nomano.shiwaza.com/tnoma/blog/archives/002379.html"><img alt="Google Server at the Computer History Museum, placard: With limited funds, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin initially deployed this system of inexpensive, interconnected PCs to process many thousands of search requests per second from Google users. This hardware system reflected the Google search algorithm itself, which is based on tolerating multiple computer failures and optimizing around them. This production server was one of about thirty such racks in the first Google data center. Even though many of the installed PCs never worked and were difficult to repair, these racks provided Google with its first large-scale computing system and allowed the company to grow quickly and at minimal cost." border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777004d0970c" height="415" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777004d0970c-pi" width="754" /></a>
<p>
If Google&#39;s first production server resembles a hastily cobbled together amalgam of off-the-shelf computer parts circa 1999, well, that&#39;s because <i>it is</i>. Just like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000305.html">Google&#39;s original servers at Stanford</a>. If you think this rack is scary, you should see what it <i>replaced</i>.
<p>
Instead of buying whatever pre-built rack-mount servers Dell, Compaq, and IBM were selling at the time, <b>Google opted to hand-build their server infrastructure themselves</b>. The sagging motherboards and hard drives are literally propped in place on handmade plywood platforms. The power switches are crudely mounted in front, the network cables draped along each side. The poorly routed power connectors snake their way back to generic PC power supplies in the rear. 
<p>
Some people might look at these early Google servers and see an amateurish fire hazard. Not me. I see a prescient understanding of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000573.html">how inexpensive commodity hardware would shape today&#39;s internet</a>. I felt right at home when I saw this server; it&#39;s <i>exactly</i> what I would have done in the same circumstances. This rack is a perfect example of the commodity x86 market D.I.Y. ethic at work: if you want it done right, and done inexpensively, you build it yourself. 
<p>
Even today, Google is serious about exerting total control over the servers in their now-massive server farms. They <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/technology/26google.html?ex=1173931200&amp;en=372d524a3de3d515&amp;ei=5070">build their own high-efficiency power supplies</a>, and conduct <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.pdf">fascinating, public research on disk failure</a> (pdf). Current estimates put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_platform">Google&#39;s server farm at around 450,000 machines</a>-- and they&#39;re still custom built, commodity-class x86 PCs, just like they were in 1999.
<p>
<b>Like Google, I demand total control over every part of my PC.</b> I&#39;ve always built my own. Building your own PC isn&#39;t for everyone, but if you&#39;re willing to add a little elbow grease, the D.I.Y. approach can result in a higher quality, better performing PC-- often at a substantial cost savings. 
<p>

If you&#39;re willing to factor out the cost of the operating system, the D.I.Y. &quot;Little Bang&quot; system offers more bang for the buck than any of its peers. And the &quot;Big Bang&quot; is off the charts, if you have the budget.
<p>
The lower-end Dell system looks quite similar, but closer inspection reveals otherwise: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Dell&#39;s use of non-standard case connectors and power supply connectors prevents future upgrades using standard commodity parts.
<li>The OEM parts used in Dell machines are generally of inferior quality to their retail equivalents. OEM parts are impressive on the surface, but cut corners to lower costs. For example, the use of slower DDR 667 memory; cut-down, featureless OEM motherboards; video cards with lower clocks and slower memory. 
<li>Absolutely no overclocking potential.
<li>Limited internal case expansion for additional hard drives and video cards.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
The Mac Pro is a beautifully designed machine, but it has some quirks, too:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Quad-core in a single socket, ala the &quot;Big Bang&quot; system, makes more sense than this Dual-Dual arrangement. Obviously Apple will produce a Dual-Quad for a total of 8 CPUs any day now. But there is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000655.html">a serious point of diminishing returns with additional CPUs</a> unless you&#39;re doing something highly specific and highly parallelizable like raytracing or rendering.
<li>Requires expensive DDR2 buffered ECC RAM, because it&#39;s a server motherboard.
<li>Zero overclocking options.
<li>667 MHz memory? Not that it matters very much to bottom-line performance, but support for different FSB speeds would be nice.
<li>The default video card and hard drive are totally pedestrian, and will limit overall performance unless replaced.
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
If you don&#39;t have the time or inclination to build your own desktop PC, the Dells and the Mac Pro are perfectly valid choices. The prices are reasonable; the configurations flexible. There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with buying pre-built, as long as you spec carefully. But by the time I&#39;m done setting up my D.I.Y. &quot;Little Bang&quot; system, it&#39;ll be faster, quieter, and more power efficient than any of the pre-built systems-- for the same money, or less. This is possible because the D.I.Y. system is uniquely mine; I choose exactly what goes in it, and exactly how it&#39;s configured.
<p>
Pre-built might work for typical users. But pre-built didn&#39;t work for Google. And pre-built doesn&#39;t work for me.
<p>
We aren&#39;t typical users. We&#39;re programmers. <b>The x86 commodity PC is the essential, ultimate tool of our craft.</b> It&#39;s the end product of 30 years of computer evolution. And it&#39;s still evolving today, with profound impact on the way we code. If you treat your PC like an appliance you plug into a wall, you&#39;ve robbed yourself of a crucial lesson on the symbiotic relationship between software and hardware. The best way to truly <i>understand</i> the commodity PC is to gleefully dig in and <b>build one yourself</b>.  Get your hands dirty and experience the economics of computer hardware first hand-- the same economics that have shaped the software industry since the very first line of code was stored in memory.
<p>
Who knows, you might even enjoy it.

  <p> Why the love for the Antec P180? All the reviews I&#39;ve seen for that case say that it&#39;s got some nice touches, but it&#39;s a PITA to work with due to weird PSU placement and cable channeling...</p>

<p>As an owner of a P180 who built two P180-based computers (mine and another one), here&#39;s why I still recommend it although it&#39;s fairly difficult to work with intially due to bizarre cable routing (and you need long PSU cables too, most PSUs are fine, but some aren&#39;t, depends of your motherboard connectors position):</p>

<p>* It&#39;s beautiful. Not in the &quot;Leds&#39;n spoilers&#39;n stuff&quot; sense, but in the &quot;this looks like a huge slab of black/grey metal [2001: A Space Odyssey  style]&quot; sense, it looks simple and smart. I really like that look.</p>

<p>* Litteraly reeks of quality and solidity. Antec had some false start issues (plastic front doors bending) but they&#39;ve now resolved them all.</p>

<p>* Helps your computer be silent, the case was built for silence and it shows/feels, unless you&#39;re a silence expert you won&#39;t do much better. And its heavyness (the skeleton is solid iron) means that the vibrations are mostly stopped dead in their tracks.</p>

<p>* Helps your computer run cool, the bizarre PSU position also means that the PSU doesn&#39;t get warmed by the CPU and GPU, nor does it warm them, works really well</p>

<p>* Apart from the PSU issues, it&#39;s extremely well thought of and easy to work with (if you forget about the huge number of screws), and it &quot;feels&quot; solid and fine (not like some flimsy cases with flesh-cutting corners)</p>

<p>In fact, the only &quot;issue&quot; I (could) have with my &#39;180 is the fact that its weight would make it impractical to transport.</p>

<p>Of course, since I hooked it to a Reserator 1 Plus (passive watercooler) and own a laptop this is an non-issue.</p>

<p>I frigging love my &#39;180.</p>

  <p>The P180 in my opinion is an OK case but as most Antec cases go its very flimsy. They tend to cut corners and not give enough support to the skeleton of the cases. I have a P180 and bought it for the room thinking it might be a good case. The plastic front is cheap, the case sides do not line up well with the frame, and the plastic filter covers are nothing but flimsy. Cable management is a pure nightmare with 7 hard drives and 2 DVD drives. I use it for my personal machine/server and it includes 2 74gb Raptors in RAID0 using the motherboard controller and 5 300gb Sata drives in RAID 5 using a LSI Sata 150-6 raid card. I plan to move everything over to a Lian Li PC201B. From past experience the Lian Li cases are of much higher quality, you can just feel it as you work with the cases. Plus the placement of the 12 internal drive bays makes much more sense than that of the P180. I do like the PSU being located in the lower part of the case, that works rather well and is another reason I will be using the Lian Li case. Trust me when I say once you have your hands on a Lian Li case, you will see what I mean.</p>

<p>And to those that do not have the time to build your own, but dont want to settle for a Dell/HP etc, go see your local mom and pop computer store. They can do the research for you and sell you a nice well balanced machine with a local warranty. </p>

So how do you know how the custom components you use are going to work together optimally? You would need a test-review of a system which consists of all (or most) of these parts. Or is it really enough to just buy each component on its own w/o having proof of how the overall system performance is going to be?</p>

  <p>I have to say that there is one particular advantage with a company like Dell (and presumably others) - they can fabricate stuff that you are unlikely to be able to make yourself. For example, I have a very nice Precision 650; Dual 3GHz Xeon processor, 4GB memory, 15k SCSI RAID.</p>

<p>Two of the really cool things inside the box that make it stand out are a processor shroud that means the case fans pull air past the CPUs - and these fans appear to be temperature controlled because they do not run all the time...</p>

<p>Secondly, the case is a dream in some senses. The power connectors are all clipped in place, and there is a molex connector for every bay... and not only that, each connector is stamped with it&#39;s position &#39;HDD 1&#39; &#39;BAY 3&#39; etc.</p>

<p>Plus, I got an amazing deal on it at the time (Dell Outlet).</p>

<p>But all your points about knowing your hardware are really valid, and Dell is certainly not forward about what specification (if any) it&#39;s mobo&#39;s / psu etc follow.<br />

  <p>Using fast computers is a good and a bad thing for a developer.</p>

<p>Good thing:<br />
- complex projects can buil faster<br />
- you can quickly see the result of very complex algorithms (I work on a raytracer, you know what I mean)<br />
- you save time on testing bug reports from users.</p>

<p>Bad things:<br />
- your algorithm implementation looks fast when it&#39;s not.<br />
- you don&#39;t care as much as you should about your code speed and how much resource it uses.<br />
- probably you could use less meory than what you are and you don&#39;t even realize it.</p>

Building in house computer is good for yourself (I always do) or very small office. But when the time of a computer failure costs more than the perfomance you could gain building your own... Systems vendors like Dell or HP are offiring very goog and cost effective support programs, with hardware replacement in 12 or even 6 hours. Something you absolutely can&#39;t have in your own.<br />
The company I&#39;m working on have thousands of computers with a very fast turn around. It would be simply too expensive to build in house solutions with standard hardware. So we leave the vendor (HP in our case) deals with components integration and hardware assistance, and our sys admins manage software and network solutions.</p>

<p>My work is worth for some hundred bucks a day. To stop to assemble a new computer is a cost. You have to consider also that when you create your in house solution.</p>

<p>But both the Antec 900 and the CoolerMaster Stacker are very different approaches compared to the P180. The P180 is designed to *block* direct sound paths from your ear to the fans, not expose them directly to your ear!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible to make these cases quiet, but it&#39;s difficult when there is nothing but wire mesh and a fan between you and the noise sources. </p>

  &quot;Quad-core in a single socket&quot; - the Mac Pro has 2 dual-core cpus, not 1 quad-core cpu</p>

<p>and an opinion: &quot;there is a serious point of diminishing returns with additional CPUs unless you&#39;re doing something highly specific and highly parallelizable &quot; - The Mac Pros are targeted towards the (who&#39;da thunk it?)

  <p>My 2 cents (or points)</p>

<p>1)  There are more then a few shops out there that build machines to your specs.  So, kind of &quot;Dell&quot;ish in that they do all the work.  But you get to decide on everything that goes into your box.  Saves you time and potential headaches but you pay a premium compared to building yourself.</p>

<p>2)  I do a majority of my development in the database (gasp, Oracle PL/SQL).  Just being able to the any of a number of DBs running on one core while I do my damage with the other is really key to productivity.  </p>

<p>I han&#39;t built my own, but I keep pricing it out every couple weeks.  I can&#39;t pull the trigger because everytime I look, the prices have fallen and the hardware faster.  That and I didn&#39;t win the lottery, again!</p>

  <p>Every time I&#39;ve put together my own system it takes a couple of hours to get everything assembled.  Then an hour or so to install the OS.  Then there are operating system and driver issues.  Once in a while, I get a motherboard where some built-in component (e.g., sound, ethernet, firewire, sata) doesn&#39;t work right.  I figure on average I&#39;ll probably spend 6 hours putting together a system.  Then, I&#39;ll run a memory test overnight to make sure the memory isn&#39;t bad.  When the test fails, sometimes reseating the modules fixes it, but that requires running another test.  Sometimes the memory is fine, but the motherboard is bad (poor tolerances on passive components on the memory bus).  These kind of memory errors are the kind of thing that don&#39;t affect 99% of users because they don&#39;t run memory intensive processes like compilers.  </p>

<p>The reason to build software is when nothing exists off the shelf that will do what you want it to do for a reasonable cost.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend the consumer-class Dell Dimension series.  However, there are lots of reasonably priced workstation class machines (such as the Dell Precision 690, or the high-end HP or IBM workstations) that will work adequately for pretty much any tasks that you will throw at them. The Mac Pro&#39;s are also workstation-class hardware (at least the CPU/Memory/Motherboard/Power Supply/Chassis).   Workstation-class machines will also have things like extra CPU sockets, 8 or more memory slots, and 750 to 1000 watt power supplies.  </p>

<p>This is very different from software, where you are almost always building something that either doesn&#39;t exist or is impossible or not cost-effective to buy.  Next time I need a spreadsheet, I&#39;ll either buy Microsoft Excel, use Google Spreadsheets, or use some open source spreadsheet.  But I definitely won&#39;t write my own.  Similarly, when I need a new workstation, I&#39;ll buy either a Dell Precision 690 (or similar HP or IBM) or a Mac Pro.  I&#39;ll look for the best deal on a high-end machine and maybe I&#39;ll upgrade it with a second hard drive or more memory, but I won&#39;t build my own.  </p>

<p>Note: For gaming machines, it&#39;s a little different.  High-end gaming machines from Dell, Alienware, VoodooPC, et cetera are very overpriced.  It is quite easy to build a machine with a much better bang-to-buck ratio.  <br />

  <p>The only problem with building your own development machine comes into play when you&#39;re developing for something other than just a computer.  I write software to run large-scale printers, and the configuration of the machine makes a pretty significant difference in the performance of the final product.</p>

<p>As much as I wish I COULD build my own dev box, the differences in specs, which affect the print, are just too much of a pain to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.  If something happens, is the problem because I coded something wrong, or because the box I built the software on uses a different chipset than the box running the software?  Those problems can take ages to knuckle out, and that&#39;s time I could be using to better end.</p>

<p>The other thing that comes into play is reliability.  Now, with one notable exception, every box I&#39;ve ever built has been solid as a rock.  Unfortunately, even in a company as small as the one I work for (11 people), being able to get parts and service is a big deal.  Most companies just can&#39;t justify the potential cost of buying parts and spending time servicing computers when they could be doing something more profitable.</p>

<p>Bottom line, I agree that building your own machine is a great way to control performance, but I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s a good idea in a corporate environment.</p>

  <p>I see your point and would agree almost completely, were I not completely in love with OS X.</p>

<p>Still, I would also point out that today Ole has a good point - you say &quot;We aren&#39;t typical users. We&#39;re programmers. The x86 commodity PC is the essential, ultimate tool of our craft.&quot; However, today there isn&#39;t just one kind of programmer - the kind who codes close to the hardware. Instead, there&#39;s a wide range of coders - from those who code way down low in C or C++, and those who code higher up in C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. And of course there are many languages and platforms at all different points in between. The higher you go, the more abstracted from the hardware - and the more you want to focus on just the software, and you want the hardware to &quot;just work&quot;. I&#39;m definitely in the &quot;higher&quot; half of that spectrum. That&#39;s why I prefer Macs and Mac OS X.</p>

  <p>A bunch of other people have hit on this, but I&#39;ll say it too: for desktop use, I&#39;m too married to portable computing these days, and that&#39;s just not a reasonable area to do it yourself. My servers, on the other hand, are hand-me-downs that I&#39;ve squeezed more life out of that should have been possible. I haven&#39;t hand-built a new system in quite a while, and I&#39;ve been all the happier for it.</p>

<p>Everyone should do the &quot;roll your own&quot; thing at least once, if this is a field you&#39;re interested in, but it&#39;s purely a learning experience. Pitching it as a cost saver misses the point a bit, and the time you&#39;ll burn sourcing parts and keeping yourself up-to-date on the latest micro-specifications on video cards, motherboards/buses, and similar issues during the build will more than outweigh the savings, and you&#39;ll be left with &quot;spec envy&quot; two months after you&#39;re done building it when the next &quot;big bang&quot; component comes out.</p>

<p>(Similarly, everyone should write a simple language interpreter or shell, develop a simple web server, write in assembly for an embedded platform, think through the corner cases of version control systems, and complete several other basic building-blocks projects as learning experiences. But then, for the love of ${DEITY}, please throw them away; the world doesn&#39;t need yet another web server. ;-)</p>

  <p>I like the concept of building my own machines, and will continue to do it for my own personal needs.  But I can&#39;t see how it&#39;s such a great idea if you&#39;re say, selling to businesses.  I can&#39;t see it being very cost effective.  If I take the time to factor in building 4 PCs, going through testing and deploying them, it&#39;s already cost me a ton more than if I had gone to a vendor.  Not to mention if something fails, I&#39;ll have to replace it out of my pocket, and who knows if I&#39;ll be able to find the same part.  So when I do replace a bad part with a different one, I&#39;ve either spent more time researching a new part, or hastily put in one that &quot;looks good&quot; and may not last as long.  Or, I can go to a vendor spec out the needed machine(s), and if something breaks then I have a warranty and the ability to provide the user with a machine the same or next day.</p>

<p>But, for my own personal, in house needs, I will always build my own machine.  I would even stretch that to my servers, it&#39;s a hell of a lot easier to work on machines you see everyday, if the need should arise.</p>

  <p>I&#39;m over building machines. I kind of enjoy watching my cow-orkers do their home machines the hard way, but after a while even that palls. It&#39;s so much cheaper to spec out what I want and pay a PC shop $50 to put it together, make it all go, burn it in and install software. Then warranty it for a year. You only have to go back once to the shop to swap something (or get one component wrong and have to buy a different one) and that $50 is a saving. My last machine took a whopping three days to deliver ... because they couldn&#39;t get the RAID card working properly with the first two motherboards they tried - WinXP wouldn&#39;t restart reliably.

  <p>@Angry American: &quot;I have a P180 and bought it for the room thinking it might be a good case. The plastic front is cheap, the case sides do not line up well with the frame, and the plastic filter covers are nothing but flimsy. Cable management is a pure nightmare with 7 hard drives and 2 DVD drives.&quot;</p>

<p>I have two P180 cases, one silver and one black, and I see none of what you describe.  However, I would not call the P180 super-roomy, although with care you can route the majority of cables to be hidden or out of the way.  If I had 7 hard drives I would probably consider something else.  </p>

<p>I was attracted to the P180 series because of their simple, clean elegance of lines and the fact that they are quiet.  Antec did have some quality issues and poor design issues with their initial version of the case.  Either that seems to be resolved, or I have two quality examples of the breed, works for me!</p>

  <p>The first x86 I owned (around 1999) was a self-built combination of new, leftover and salvaged components, all chosen to get the best bang for the buck from what I had available. It meant I could build a pretty competent system for short change, and knew exactly what was in it, what the weak points were, and hence what needed upgrading first when I could afford to.</p>

<p>That PC evolved over about 5 years, keeping up with the latest games and moving from Windows 98 to ME (ugh!), 2000 and finally Linux without *ever* having to buy a whole new system in one go. By the time I replaced that system with one of those &quot;desktop replacement&quot; laptops a couple of years ago, only the case, keyboard and floppy drive remained from the original build!</p>

<p>There *is* one potential problem with that approach now: I can only imagine the trouble XP or Vista product activation could have caused me with all those incremental upgrades to the hardware.</p>

  <p> the Mac in that lineup is using 2 x Dual Core XEON PROCESSORS. You can&#39;t buy a Mac Pro with a Core 2 Duo</p>

<p>There is no *functional* difference between a Xeon and a Core 2 Duo. It&#39;s a branding issue for Intel, so they can charge more and limit those CPUs to particular server-class motherboards.</p>

<p> now it&#39;s hard to justify spending about the same for a PC without Windows and Office</p>

<p>We are rapidly approaching a world where the software costs more than the hardware. Well, minus open source. Or maybe open source is better suited to a world  where hardware is cheap and getting cheaper every day.</p>

<p> those RAID configurations on the &quot;big bang&quot; are a total waste</p>

<p>I agree completely (although RAID-1 is useful). I&#39;ll never use RAID-0 in any of my systems. But if you&#39;re going for overkill, I say go for the nuclear option. That&#39;s why it is &quot;big bang&quot;. I would also argue that quad-core in general is utterly wasted on most people who buy the machines. But 4  1, just like 64  32, so it must be better.. right?</p>

<p> That&#39;s about as far from the hardware as you can get, your code doesn&#39;t even compile natively, it runs on a CLR which exposes a virtual machine.</p>

<p>And yet the regular, inexorable advance in performance for cheap commodity hardware is *exactly* how we got where we are today. It&#39;s turtles all the way down!</p>

<p> Is it possible these days, theoretical or otherwise, to build your own mac??</p>

<p>No, and it&#39;s funny, because OS X enthusiasts love to crow about how OS X lacks all of Vista&#39;s copy protection measures.. when in reality it has the ULTIMATE anti-piracy measure: it won&#39;t run on anything except for Apple-blessed machines. The damn thing is a giant hardware copy protection dongle!</p>

<p>  If something happens, is the problem because I coded something wrong, or because the box I built the software on uses a different chipset than the box running the software?</p>

<p>Yeah, but in the world of PCs, you will end up doing this troubleshooting anyway. Trust me. There&#39;s too much beige box crap out there, and too many parts to fit together and interoperate. Better to learn how rather than avoiding it.</p>

<p> But at a certain point, I just want to get stuff done and at that point buying off the shelf makes sense for me.</p>

<p>Again, there is nothing wrong with buying pre-built. It&#39;s a lifestyle choice more than anything else. But I still say it&#39;s worthwhile if you have the time, on several different levels.</p>

You know, maybe take an old Socket A mobo, dump in dual 1.8 Ghz processors and throw on a gig or two of Flash-based RAM.

  <p>The major difference between the Core 2 Duo and the new Xeons in the Mac Pro is the memory and the memory controller.</p>

<p>The FB-DIMMs cost more because they are considerably faster, and are on each pair of sockets are on their own bus, so you get a large performance boost from using as many of the sockets as you can. Almost none of the Core 2 motherboards support an address space larger than 2^32, so you&#39;re limited to 3GB of RAM. The Mac Pro will support 32 GB of RAM if you go hog-wild with the $600 (for now) sticks of RAM.</p>

<p>And 10.5 transparently supports 4-architecture (ppc, ppc970, x86, amd64) binaries and gives them each all the address space and registers they can handle.</p>

  <p> We, and I&#39;m speaking for the entire world now, we want an application to run on our off-the-shelf Dell with a slow processor, little memory, and teeny disk. Put yourself on a machine like that and learn to program the way most of us compute. You&#39;ll be doing us all a favor and learn a little, too. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this argument from others as well, often from IT managers responsible for buying machines for an entire organization. As a developer, I have an obvious bias against this advice for a couple of reasons: </p>

<p>First, the typical user has to run our application alongside things like Outlook, Excel, a web browser, and so on. The developer, however, has to run the application alongside those same things... plus the development environment, debugging tools, a version control client, etc. It&#39;s not uncommon for a developer in the midst of a coding streak to have a dozen or more applications open.</p>

<p>Second, a good portion of our development time is spent compiling/building the software itself. A smaller machine with less power will be several times slower than a fast machine in doing that... convert that time spent waiting on a machine into salary dollars and most business managers will happily buy the beefy hardware.</p>

<p>So while it IS important that applications be tested on the types of hardware that they&#39;ll eventually run on (from the low-end on up), that&#39;s what testing environments and QA labs are for.</p>

  <p>This is why programmers don&#39;t get it. Jeff says: &quot;We aren&#39;t typical users. We&#39;re programmers. The x86 commodity PC is the essential, ultimate tool of our craft.&quot;<br />
What you need is to do your coding on a Dell, or some other off-the-shelf computer. We can all make an application run on a &quot;big bang&quot; or a &quot;little bang&quot;. That&#39;s easy.<br />
We, and I&#39;m speaking for the entire world now, we want an application to run on our off-the-shelf Dell with a slow processor, little memory, and teeny disk.<br />
Put yourself on a machine like that and learn to program the way most of us compute. You&#39;ll be doing us all a favor and learn a little, too.</p>

  <p>Enjoyable post  feedback, as usual!</p>

<p>I have to disagree on the &quot;bang for the buck&quot; equation though. As a number of people have pointed out, don&#39;t forget to add labor in the &quot;buck&quot; part of the equation. Your DIY box won&#39;t look so competitive anymore. I suspect that, if you compare the true total cost, you can never beat any PC maker (unless you value your labor as zero dollar!). That&#39;s just how mass production works. </p>

<p>The biggest benefit of DIY is the maximum degree of fine tuning. You get a PC exactly the way you want it. Another benefit is intangible, but by no means small: you gain hands-on knowledge about hardware, plus personal satisfaction.</p>

<p>Google operates at the opposite extreme to individual DIY enthusiasts. Making their own boxes make perfect financial sense for them. But I don&#39;t think you can apply their reasoning to our end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>For non-DIY folks, I think it&#39;s much better to buy the best machine that you want, and put the expense in your client&#39;s bill! :-)<br />
Your clients would want you to spend time on software development anyway, not hardware.</p>

  <p>Instead of all RAID in the computer I have switched to an external RAID device.<br />
I went with a synology 406 and it is nice, got 4 drives in it and now have around 1.25 Terrabyte at RAID 5. <br />
It is hooked up to my router so my laptop and desktop have quick access, it is always on(it has a low power mode) and is quite enough that I have in the living room with no problems.<br />
Configuration wise I have multiple shared drive, some that I backup to another partition.  I also use it to store the backup of my computers.</p>

<p>You could go DIY but unless you already have the case and the RAID card it is not that much different.  However the non-DYI has the benifit in that more limited so you don&#39;t have to worry about every security patch, it is smaller, and better yet it just works.</p>

  <p>Isn&#39;t it odd to ding Dell for using 667 memory, and then say &quot;Not that it matters very much to bottom-line performance&quot; later?</p>

<p>Tim: Slight problem there; development environments can need more horsepower than the target product. For instance, I work for a company that makes a point-of-sale system that needs to run on IAstoundingly Crappy/i hardware (by modern standards);  1ghz pentium-2 clone class CPUs, maybe 512M of ram. (It&#39;ll actually run on any plausible PC, but there are dedicated terminals with those specs we Imust/i support for business reasons.)</p>

<p>If I tried to run Visual Studio on that, I&#39;d Inever be able to get anything done/i...</p>

<p>(Your overall point is an excellent one, however - it&#39;s just that while we should all Itest/i our software to see how it Ihandles/i, on lower-end machines, it&#39;s not likely to be a good idea to use them as a development system.)</p>

I went this route in the past, and I think you&#39;re expressing a false economy.   There is a significant cost to buying and discarding garbage commodity parts in trying to build this optimal system.  It makes sense if you&#39;re a business like google who is building a farm-- where you can spend that time and money wading thru the junk that doesn&#39;t work at all, or is poor quality-- and then replicate your final configuration many times over.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re an engineer, you should build a computer for yourself *once*, or maybe one to be a mail server--- but your development machine needs to be a high quality, reliable box that you can count on.  Not one that will send you to the fly-by-nite-pc-parts-place the night before you want to deliver your code because your increased compilation in recent days has pushed the mb over its thermal limite, or whatever. </p>

<p>this is why the Mac Pro is, by far, the least expensive and most reliable choice of the four you presented.    You *may* be able to make your custom build machine as reliable-- but in my experience ,commodity hardware does not last-- and the people who build their own do not realize this because inside of 12 months they have replaced the part with something else....   Buying a machine that is cheaper to begin with and then using it twice or three times as long is the better deal.</p>

<p>I reached this conclusion in the 1990s, and once again I&#39;m working for a startup with a guy who is the server builder... and watching him go thru DOA parts and hassles makes me convinced that while it may make sense for servers, it does not for engineers.</p>

<p><br />
Better to spend the time you would be researching motherboards learning erlang or otherwise getting your code more concurrent.</p>

  <p>I&#39;m a (web) designer and love to build my own DIY systems, so this DIY stuff isn&#39;t just for the programmers and engineers. This is part of the reason why I&#39;ve not switched to a Mac (which I have, naturally, been tempted by).</p>

<p>I would have to completely disagree with Lysander&#39;s comments. I&#39;ve had far more things go wrong with pre-built machines (Dells, mainly, at my place of work) than with my DIY machines. My Mac using friends also have an increasingly high failure rate (but that&#39;s with the laptops; I&#39;ve not heard of anything going wrong with their desktops). The key point with DIY builds is that you know what&#39;s going into it and can control it. That not only makes for a more reliable system, but there&#39;s definitely a more satisfying sense of ownership of the machine. The bottom line for me is that I enjoy computers, so naturally I enjoy building them too.</p>

  <p>Hello folks,</p>

<p>I have been building my own PCs and servers for work for a really long time. I started when a 486/66 was top dog! I still remember seeing the first quad Xeon in Vegas at the show. It was a huge box with four motherboards in a star configuration. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to believe in a small boot drive and a RAID data drive set. No RAID 0 by itself, that is just stupid. The small boot drive makes it easier to update or swap the OS and still have the data. I started using removable boot drives years ago too. Just slide in another drive for a different OS. OS multi-boot was usually too much of a pain. I do it on my laptops though.</p>

<p>I have been bored with building PCs now. Everything is on the motherboard. It is so easy that any High School kid can do it. It used to be that you had to set jumpers for all of the IRQs and IO Bases on each card that went in. If you wanted a parallel port, you needed a card. Want a serial port? Put in a card. There is no magic to it anymore. It is only in the tweaking and OCing that there is any edge to it.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of years I&#39;ve moved on to the laptop world. I buy up old and broken laptops and see what kind of hot-rodding I can do with them. It has been fun again! I&#39;ve learned a lot from them about how to make things more efficient and more compact. </p>

<p>I&#39;m building up a LAN Party micro case this week. It will be full on rock n&#39; roll. Quad core chip and all. It will, of course include a small boot drive and a RAID 1 data set. I prefer RAID 5, but there isn&#39;t going to be enough room. It will still have a removable boot drive though! I may even try OS X on it. CentOS is for sure though. It may include a pull out monitor, I haven&#39;t decided on that yet. There just isn&#39;t much room to add that to it.</p>

<p>As to the Google setup, I used to use a slab of plywood with motherboard mounts screwed in and a power supply mounted on the back to setup new boards. It made it easier to get all of the cards setup (jumpers and all) and then just move the proven good configuration to the case later. I never had to stack them up as a production rig like theirs though!</p>

<p>This is an interesting blog. I will have to check back on it from time to time.</p>

<p>Later!</p>
