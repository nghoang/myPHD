<span class="preview" id="pv149"> In computer science, an instruction typically refers to a single operation of a processor within a computer architecture. ...</span>

<span class="preview" id="pv150"> A computer program is a collection of instructions that describe a task, or set of tasks, to be carried out by a computer. ...</span>
</p> <p><br/>In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's <a href="/encyclopedia/Computer-storage" onmouseover="pv(event, 151)" onmouseout="unpv(151)" style="">memory</a> and are generally carried out (<a href=/graph-T/cri_exe title="executions">executed</a>) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or <a href=/graph-T/mil_bra title="branches">branches</a>). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen <a href="/encyclopedia/Conditional-statement" onmouseover="pv(event, 154)" onmouseout="unpv(154)" style="">conditionally</a> so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support <a href="/encyclopedia/Subroutine" onmouseover="pv(event, 155)" onmouseout="unpv(155)" style="">subroutines</a> by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to that point.<span class="preview" id="pv151"> This article does not cite any references or sources. ...</span>

<span class="preview" id="pv154">  In computer science, conditional statements are a vital part of a programming language. ...</span>

<span class="preview" id="pv155">  In computer science, a subroutine (function, method, procedure, or subprogram) is a portion of code within a larger program, which performs a specific task and can be relatively independent of the remaining code. ...</span>
</p> <p><br/>Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the <a href="/encyclopedia/Control-flow" onmouseover="pv(event, 156)" onmouseout="unpv(156)" style="">flow of control</a> within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.<span class="preview" id="pv156"> In computer science control flow (or alternatively, flow of control) refers to the order in which the individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative or functional program are executed or evaluated. ...</span>

But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time — with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. For example:<span class="preview" id="pv157"> For other uses, see Calculator (disambiguation). ...</span>

</p> <p><br/>In most computers, individual instructions are stored as <a href="/encyclopedia/Machine-code" onmouseover="pv(event, 173)" onmouseout="unpv(173)" style="">machine code</a> with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or <a href="/encyclopedia/Opcode" onmouseover="pv(event, 174)" onmouseout="unpv(174)" style="">opcode</a> for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode, the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions, the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from — each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer just as if they were numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the <a href="/encyclopedia/Harvard-architecture" onmouseover="pv(event, 175)" onmouseout="unpv(175)" style="">Harvard architecture</a> after the <a href="/encyclopedia/Harvard-Mark-I" onmouseover="pv(event, 176)" onmouseout="unpv(176)" style="">Harvard Mark I</a> computer.

Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember — a <a href="/encyclopedia/Mnemonic" onmouseover="pv(event, 180)" onmouseout="unpv(180)" style="">mnemonic</a> such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's <a href="/encyclopedia/Assembly-language" onmouseover="pv(event, 181)" onmouseout="unpv(181)" style="">assembly language</a>. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler. Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed low-level programming languages) tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an <a href="/encyclopedia/ARM-architecture" onmouseover="pv(event, 183)" onmouseout="unpv(183)" style="">ARM architecture</a> computer (such as may be found in a <a href="/encyclopedia/Personal-digital-assistant" onmouseover="pv(event, 184)" onmouseout="unpv(184)" style="">PDA</a> or a <a href="/encyclopedia/Handheld-console-game" onmouseover="pv(event, 185)" onmouseout="unpv(185)" style="">hand-held videogame</a>) cannot understand the machine language of an <a href="/encyclopedia/Pentium" onmouseover="pv(event, 186)" onmouseout="unpv(186)" style="">Intel Pentium</a> or the <a href="/encyclopedia/Athlon-64" onmouseover="pv(event, 187)" onmouseout="unpv(187)" style="">AMD Athlon 64</a> computer that might be in a <a href="/encyclopedia/Personal-computer" onmouseover="pv(event, 188)" onmouseout="unpv(188)" style="">PC</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup><span class="preview" id="pv178">    A system of codes directly understandable by a computers CPU is termed this CPUs native or machine language. ...</span>

</p> <p><br/>Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and error prone. Therefore, most complicated programs are written in more abstract <a href="/encyclopedia/High_level-programming-language" onmouseover="pv(event, 190)" onmouseout="unpv(190)" style="">high-level programming languages</a> that are able to express the needs of the <a href="/encyclopedia/Computer-programmer" onmouseover="pv(event, 191)" onmouseout="unpv(191)" style="">computer programmer</a> more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually "compiled" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a <a href="/encyclopedia/Compiler" onmouseover="pv(event, 192)" onmouseout="unpv(192)" style="">compiler</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Since high level languages are more abstract than assembly language, it is possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.

The computer can be instructed to "put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595". The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease.

Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers; either from 0 to 255 or -128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in <a href="/encyclopedia/Two%27s-complement" onmouseover="pv(event, 256)" onmouseout="unpv(256)" style="">two's complement</a> notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory as long as it can be somehow represented in numerical form. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.<span class="preview" id="pv253">  The binary or base-two numeral system is a system for representing numbers in which a radix of two is used; that is, each digit in a binary numeral may have either of two different values. ...</span>

</p> <p><br/>The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called <a href="/encyclopedia/Processor-register" onmouseover="pv(event, 257)" onmouseout="unpv(257)" style="">registers</a> that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. Since data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.<span class="preview" id="pv257"> In computer architecture, a processor register is a small amount of very fast computer memory used to speed the execution of computer programs by providing quick access to frequently used values&acirc;&#128;&#148;typically, these values are involved in multiple expression evaluations occurring within a small region on the program. ...</span>
</p> <p><br/>Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties: <a href="/encyclopedia/Random-access-memory" onmouseover="pv(event, 258)" onmouseout="unpv(258)" style="">random access memory</a> or RAM and <a href="/encyclopedia/Read_only-memory" onmouseover="pv(event, 259)" onmouseout="unpv(259)" style="">read-only memory</a> or ROM. RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is pre-loaded with data and software that never changes, so the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM is erased when the power to the computer is turned off while ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the <a href="/encyclopedia/BIOS" onmouseover="pv(event, 260)" onmouseout="unpv(260)" style="">BIOS</a> that orchestrates loading the computer's <a href="/encyclopedia/Operating-system" onmouseover="pv(event, 261)" onmouseout="unpv(261)" style="">operating system</a> from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In <a href="/encyclopedia/Embedded-computer" onmouseover="pv(event, 262)" onmouseout="unpv(262)" style="">embedded computers</a>, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the software required to perform the task may be stored in ROM. Software that is stored in ROM is often called <a href="/encyclopedia/Firmware" onmouseover="pv(event, 263)" onmouseout="unpv(263)" style="">firmware</a> because it is notionally more like hardware than software. <a href="/encyclopedia/Flash-memory" onmouseover="pv(event, 264)" onmouseout="unpv(264)" style="">Flash memory</a> blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM by retaining data when turned off but being rewritable like RAM. However, flash memory is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM so its use is restricted to applications where high speeds are not required.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup><span class="preview" id="pv258"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;RAM&acirc;&#128;&#157; redirects here. ...</span>

This is achieved by having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn. One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an <a href="/encyclopedia/Interrupt" onmouseover="pv(event, 286)" onmouseout="unpv(286)" style="">interrupt</a> which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time", then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.<span class="preview" id="pv285"> In computing, multitasking is a method by which multiple tasks, also known as processes, share common processing resources such as a CPU.

</p> <p><br/>Before the era of cheap computers, the principle use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer.</p> <p><br/>Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly - in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running. However, most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run at the same time without unacceptable speed loss.</p> <p><br/><a name="Multiprocessing" id="Multiprocessing"></a></p> <h3> <span class="mw-headline">Multiprocessing</span></h3> <dl> <dd> <div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="/encyclopedia/Multiprocessing" onmouseover="pv(event, 288)" onmouseout="unpv(288)" style="">Multiprocessing</a></i></div> </dd> </dl> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="/encyclopedia/Image:Cray-2-Arts-et-Metiers-dsc03940.jpg" onmouseover="pv(event, 289)" onmouseout="unpv(289)" style="">

</p> <p><br/>In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. This effort was funded by ARPA (now <a href="/encyclopedia/DARPA" onmouseover="pv(event, 309)" onmouseout="unpv(309)" style="">DARPA</a>), and the <a href="/encyclopedia/Computer-network" onmouseover="pv(event, 310)" onmouseout="unpv(310)" style="">computer network</a> that it produced was called the <a href="/encyclopedia/Advanced-Research-Projects-Agency-Network" onmouseover="pv(event, 311)" onmouseout="unpv(311)" style="">ARPANET</a>. The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved. In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the <a href=/cat/Internet title="Internet">Internet</a>. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like <a href="/encyclopedia/E_mail" onmouseover="pv(event, 313)" onmouseout="unpv(313)" style="">e-mail</a> and the <a href="/encyclopedia/World-Wide-Web" onmouseover="pv(event, 314)" onmouseout="unpv(314)" style="">World Wide Web</a>, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like <a href="/encyclopedia/Ethernet" onmouseover="pv(event, 315)" onmouseout="unpv(315)" style="">Ethernet</a> and <a href="/encyclopedia/ADSL" onmouseover="pv(event, 316)" onmouseout="unpv(316)" style="">ADSL</a> saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of <a href=/graph-T/med_per_com title="personal computers">personal computers</a> regularly connect to the <a href=/cat/Internet title="Internet">Internet</a> to communicate and receive information.

Unlike <a href="/encyclopedia/Natural-language" onmouseover="pv(event, 548)" onmouseout="unpv(548)" style="">natural languages</a>, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise.

An <a href="/encyclopedia/X86_64" onmouseover="pv(event, 654)" onmouseout="unpv(654)" style="">x86-64</a> compatible microprocessor like the <a href="/encyclopedia/Advanced-Micro-Devices" onmouseover="pv(event, 655)" onmouseout="unpv(655)" style="">AMD</a> <a href="/encyclopedia/Athlon-64" onmouseover="pv(event, 656)" onmouseout="unpv(656)" style="">Athlon 64</a> is able to run most of the same programs that an <a href="/encyclopedia/Intel-Core-2" onmouseover="pv(event, 657)" onmouseout="unpv(657)" style="">Intel Core 2</a> microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel <a href="/encyclopedia/Pentium" onmouseover="pv(event, 658)" onmouseout="unpv(658)" style="">Pentiums</a> and <a href="/encyclopedia/Intel-80486" onmouseover="pv(event, 659)" onmouseout="unpv(659)" style="">Intel 80486</a>. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.</li> <li id="_note-8"><b><a href="#_ref-8" title="">^</a></b> High level languages are also often <a href="/encyclopedia/Interpreted-language" onmouseover="pv(event, 661)" onmouseout="unpv(661)" style="">interpreted</a> rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly by another program called an <a href="/encyclopedia/Interpreter-%28computing%29" onmouseover="pv(event, 662)" onmouseout="unpv(662)" style="">interpreter</a>.</li> <li id="_note-9"><b><a href="#_ref-9" title="">^</a></b> Although this is a simple program, it contains a <i><a href="/encyclopedia/Software-bug" onmouseover="pv(event, 664)" onmouseout="unpv(664)" style="">software bug</a></i>. If the traffic signal is showing red when someone switches the "flash red" switch, it will cycle through green once more before starting to flash red as instructed. This bug is quite easy to fix by changing the program to repeatedly test the switch throughout each "wait" period — but writing large programs that have no bugs is exceedingly difficult.</li> <li id="_note-10"><b><a href="#_ref-10" title="">^</a></b> The control unit's rule in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. While the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Many computers include some instructions that may only be partially interpreted by the control system and partially interpreted by another device. This is especially the case with specialized computing hardware that may be partially self-contained. For example, <a href="/encyclopedia/EDVAC" onmouseover="pv(event, 666)" onmouseout="unpv(666)" style="">EDVAC</a>, the first modern stored program computer to be designed, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.</li> <li id="_note-11"><b><a href="#_ref-11" title="">^</a></b> Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, so the program counters usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.</li> <li id="_note-12"><b><a href="#_ref-12" title="">^</a></b> Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. <span class="reference" id="ref_verma1988a"><a href="#endnote_verma1988a" title="">(Verma 1988)</a></span></li> <li id="_note-13"><b><a href="#_ref-13" title="">^</a></b> However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called <a href="/encyclopedia/Computer-cluster" onmouseover="pv(event, 671)" onmouseout="unpv(671)" style="">computer clusters</a> can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. <span class="reference" id="ref_top5002006a"><a href="#endnote_top5002006a" title="">(TOP500 2006)</a></span></li> <li id="_note-14"><b><a href="#_ref-14" title="">^</a></b> Most major 64-bit <a href="/encyclopedia/Instruction-set-architecture" onmouseover="pv(event, 674)" onmouseout="unpv(674)" style="">instruction set architectures</a> are extensions of earlier designs.
