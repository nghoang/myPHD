<p class='disclaimer'>
The information on this page applies to <strong>future</strong> students. <strong>Current</strong> students should refer to their <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/handbooks">faculty handbooks</a> for course information.
</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology (BCST) will prepare you to work at the cutting edge of information technology. After you have completed core studies in programming, databases, systems analysis, and professional IT practice, you will pursue a course of study along one of two streams: information systems or computer science. <br /><br />The information systems stream comprises the study of the direct application of software design and development to the business domain. You will gain an understanding of the principles and techniques involved in the analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of computer systems within a business environment. <br /><br />The computer science stream involves the study of computers and computer programs. You will excel in this stream if you're more technically-minded and want to contribute to the future development and support of computer technology.<br /><br />You're encouraged to explore their interests by enrolling in units from a range of other disciplines such as psychology, languages, biology, philosophy, geography or commerce. This study experience provides domain-specific knowledge useful to the application of information technologies in that area.<br /><br />For full details on course structure, core requirements  and subject choices  see<br /><a href="http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/engineering" target="_blank">http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/engineering</a><br /><br /></p>

<h2>Further course information</h2>
<div class='block majors'>
<h3 class='subtitle'>Study plan</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology is undertaken full-time over three years. Students enrol in junior units of study with a maximum 48 credit points during first year. A typical unit of study has a value of 6 credit points. All students enrol in one of two streams: information systems or computer science. From first to third year students will complete core units of study as required by their stream with some electives available each year.<br /><br />see <a href="http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank">http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/</a> for details</p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>Progression rules</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies will monitor students for satisfactory progress towards the completion of the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology. In addition to the common triggers used to identify students not meeting academic progression requirements (as defined by the progression requirements of the coursework rule), students must pass any unit of study identified in the course resolutions as being critical to progression through the course.</p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>What is a major?</h3>
<p>All students in the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology will enrol in one of two streams: information systems or computer science. Each stream will contain core units specific to that stream and recommend electives within that stream.</p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>What is an elective?</h3>
<p>An elective is a unit of study within a degree, usually an option within a course. Electives allow more detailed study of a particular subject. <br />Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology electives are often recommended within the stream undertaken as they are directly related to, or build a more comprehensive understanding of content taught in, core units of study within that stream.</p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>Course opportunities</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies offers a one-year international exchange program.</p>
</div>
<h2>Course outcomes and further study</h2>
<div class='block majors'>
<h3 class='subtitle'>Graduate opportunities</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies enjoys strong professional and research links with Australian and global industry, affording unparalleled opportunities for Sydney IT graduates. The Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology will produce graduates who are IT specialists and possess an excellent combination of knowledge and practical, hands-on expertise to influence and reinforce an organisationÕs technology infrastructure and to support the people who use it. They will often be responsible for selecting and deploying software products appropriate for an organisation. They may also be involved in  creating and managing business applications, web sites, systems and the IT environment in all types of industries.</p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>Course accreditation</h3>
<p>The Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology has also been awarded professional level accreditation by the Australian Computer Society <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/." target="_blank">http://www.acs.org.au/.</a></p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>Further study</h3>
<p>The Graduate School of Engineering and IT <a href="http://www.eng.usyd.edu.au/gse/index.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.eng.usyd.edu.au/gse/index.shtml</a> provides a link between postgraduate students in the different engineering disciplines, and offers a welcoming and supportive environment in which to undertake challenging coursework programs and research. The faculty's postgraduate coursework and research are focused on industrial applications supported by strong fundamental research programs run by internationally recognised academics.</p>
<h3 class='subtitle'>About honours</h3>
<p>Students who have qualified for the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology degree may apply to enter the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology (Honours) year. Please note that unlike the Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) or the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), honours in the Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology requires an additional 48 credit points of study. It is available in either the computer science or information systems stream, depending on the study completed during the degree. <br />Computer science honours provides specialist training for postgraduate research in computer science, and for IT research and development in industry or business. Information systems honours provides graduates with the analytical and consulting skills for solving problems (or performing research) in a variety of areas in the IT sector. Both consist of advanced coursework related to the research interests of members of the school and a year-long project conducted under the supervision of an academic staff member. <br />As a specialist degree, the aim of honours is not to cover the full breadth of IT, but rather to introduce students to the cutting edge in selected areas of research and practice. It provides an opportunity to become actively involved in the research carried out by members of the school. Graduates take skills with them into the workplace which give them a competitive edge. Consequently, University of Sydney graduates are much in demand within the industry.</p>
