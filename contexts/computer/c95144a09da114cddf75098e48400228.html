<h3 class="date">August 26, 2007</h3> 

<p>I spend almost every waking moment in front of a computer. I'm what you might call an <em>indoor enthusiast</em>. <strong>I've been lucky not to experience any kind of computer-related injury due to my prolonged use of computers</strong>, but it is a very real professional risk. I get some occasional soreness in my hands or wrists, mostly after marathon binges where I've clearly overdone it &ndash; but that's about the extent of it. All too many of my friends have struggled with long-term <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=f54ee04c-7732-454c-be36-c9f764cbe2ab">back pain</a> or <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/10/The-Real-Pain-Of-Software-Development-1.aspx">hand</a> <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheProgrammersHands.aspx">pain</a>. While you can (and should) <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/geek-diet-and-exercise-programs.html">exercise your body</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/programming-your-hands.html">exercise your hands</a> to strengthen them, there's one part of this equation I've been ignoring.</p>
<p>I've been on a quest for the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/03/the-ideal-computer-desk.html">ultimate computer desk</a> for a few years now, and I've talked at length about the value of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/investing-in-a-quality-programming-chair.html">investing in a great chair</a>. But I hadn't considered whether my current desk and chair is configured properly to fit my body. What about the <b>ergonomics</b> of my computer workstation?</p>
<p>The OSHA has an <a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/">official page on computer workstation ergonomics</a>, which is a good starting point. But like all government documents, there's a lot more detail here than most people will ever need. The summary picture does give you an idea of what an ergonomic seating position looks like, though. <b>How close is this to the way you're sitting right now?</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/"><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701209970c" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701209970c-pi" border="0" alt="OSHA computer workstation diagram" width="195" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't get enough credit for their often innovative hardware division, which <a href="http://www.e-radiography.net/computing/mouse.htm">first popularized ergonomic computer input devices</a>, starting with the Microsoft Mouse 2.0 in 1993 and following with the Microsoft Natural Keyboard in 1994. With Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/hcg/hcg_view.mspx">long-standing interest in hardware ergonomics</a>, perhaps it's not too surprising to find that their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/hcg/default.html">healthy computing guide</a> is one of the best and most succinct references for ergonomic computing I've found. But you don't have to read it. I'll summarize the key guidelines for computer workstation ergonomics here, distilling the best advice from <em>all</em> the sources I found.</p>
<p>I know I've harped on this, but it bears repeating: <strong>a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/03/the-ideal-computer-desk.html">quality desk</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/investing-in-a-quality-programming-chair.html">quality chair</a> will be some of the best investments you'll <em>ever</em> make as a software developer</strong>. They will last you for 10 years or more, and contribute directly to your work happiness every single day.
</p>
<p>
If you value your physical health, this is not an area you want to economize on. Hopefully you've invested in a decent computer desk and chair that <strong>provide the required adjustability</strong> to achieve an ergonomically correct computer workstation. Beyond the chair, you'll need to potentially adjust the height of your desk and your monitor, too.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b01287770121a970c" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b01287770121a970c-pi" border="0" alt="Computing ergonomics, adjustable desk and chair" width="242" height="233" /></p>
<p>
<p><strong>1. The top of your monitor should be at eye level</strong>, and directly centered in front of you. It should be about an arm's length in front of you.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701227970c" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701227970c-pi" border="0" alt="Computing ergonomics, monitor position" width="242" height="265" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Your desk surface should be at roughly belly button level</strong>. When your arms are placed on the desk, your elbows should be at a ~90 degree angle, just below the desk surface. The armrests of your chair should be at nearly the same level as the desk surface to support your elbows.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701239970c" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701239970c-pi" border="0" alt="Computing ergonomics, desk surface" width="242" height="138" /></p>
<p><strong>3. Your feet should be flat on the floor with your knees at a ~90 degree angle</strong>. Your seat should not be pressing into the back of your knees; if necessary, tilt it slightly forward to alleviate any knee pressure. Sit fully back in your chair, with your back and shoulders straight and supported by the back of the chair.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701244970c" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701244970c-pi" border="0" alt="Computing ergonomics, legs" width="242" height="196" /></p>
<p><strong>4. When typing, your wrists should be in line with your forearms and not bent up, down, or to the side.</strong> Your keyboard should be directly centered in front of you. Other frequently used items should be nearby, within arm's reach.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701248970c" src="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877701248970c-pi" border="0" alt="Computing ergonomics, arms" width="242" height="166" /></p>
<p>When it comes to computer workstation ergonomics, these are the most basic, most commonly repeated guidelines I saw. Ergonomics is a holistic discipline, not a science, so your results may vary. Still, I'm surprised how many of these very basic guidelines I've been breaking for so many years, without even thinking about it. I'll be adjusting my home desk tomorrow in hopes of more comfortable computing.</p>

  <p>I&#39;m beginning to wonder about that top-of-the-monitor-at-eye-level thing. That advice dates back at least to the time that 13&quot; monitors were considered large. Should I still keep the top of my 24&quot; iMac monitor at eye level? If so, I&#39;m going to need to find a really short desk or maybe a desk with a monitor well.<br />

  <p> 2) Preferring the keyboard over the mouse whenever possible. On those rare occasions when I start feeling twinges, I usually find it&#39;s due to excessive mousing rather than excessive typing.</p>

<p>Kevin, great point. I have an ergonomically designed trackball made by Logitech. It&#39;s the smaller of ones they make. I was thinking to myself last night that I had to stop using it as my wrist was just killing me. Event though it&#39;s &#39;ergonomically&#39; designed, after serious prolonged use it didn&#39;t matter how it was designed, it hurt. </p>

<p>Come to think of it, I credit a lot of my keyboard shortcut learning not merely because of the speed increase, but also because my hands generally felt better after using them instead of a mouse. If it&#39;s a shortcut I may not know, sometimes I&#39;d rather hit some keys trying to find the right ones than going back to the mouse due to the wrist pain. </p>

  <div class="comments-body kempis_curious"> 
  <p>I sit with my chair back and feet up... they&#39;re on a monitor box under my desk. The result being an easy-chair posture, which I feel reduces pressure on the back.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also noticed that the fat programmers seem to get carpal tunnel more than the thin ones... I assume it&#39;s because the wideness of their trunk forces their elbows out, so the wrists have to be bent outwards in order to use a keyboard. I suppose a split keyboard would help, but the best thing would be to lose weight, fatties! </p>

  <p>good post!</p>

<p>i learned a few things the hard way on this.  i had good posture and workstation but for awhile i didn&#39;t do much else than write software.</p>

<p>here&#39;s what i learned:</p>

<p>- anything you do will need to include seriously cut back work schedule.  you must learn to stay away from the keyboard when not working.  if you don&#39;t, any gains you would&#39;ve had from these other items will be used up.  my employer hired a typist for me!  </p>

<p>- it&#39;s important to be strong  diversify your activities.  thus sayeth the physiotherapist:  strength is an important part of durability.  (i work around the house much more now).</p>

<p>- stop RIGHT AWAY if you have a problem (i didn&#39;t).  </p>

<p>- it seems to be difficult to diagnose but see a doctor and especially a physiotherapist--especially one in a big city who specializes in hands (Vancouver Hand Physiotherapy Clinic).  x-rays may show nothing.  it was simple &quot;over use&quot;.  in my case it was simple over use...each &quot;over use&quot; episode makes the next one come easier.</p>

<p>- i converted to Dvorak keyboard layout.  it helps but regrettably it makes you incompatible with other keyboard layouts.  it&#39;s worth it--my fingers are better now.</p>

<p>- do some finger massages, clenched fists, and any other exercises recommended.</p>

<p>- i use the shift keys during coding only...hence the near complete absence of capital letters.</p>

<p>- i keep a newspaper at my desk  try to stop for a few minutes an hour to read a page or so.</p>

<p>- have also sometimes set up my mouse on the left side for a while.</p>

  <div class="comments-body atario"> 
  <p>I find that the best ergonomic advice is that there is no one optimal position.  You have to keep moving and adjusting and shifting in your seat every five or ten minutes.  If you habitually sit in any single position for extended periods of time -- yes, even the ergonomics-guide-blessed one above -- you will have problems.</p>

<p>It helps me that I&#39;m a bit of a natural fidgeter.</p>

  <p>I still use the MS Natural keyboard I got in 1995; it&#39;s the most comfortable I&#39;ve seen.  But the big number pad on the right can be an issue.  It puts the mouse further away.</p>

<p>So I switched to left handded mousing.  The mouse is now left of my keyboard.  I also switched the mouse buttons.  </p>

<p>It took a couple days to get used to it, but now it&#39;s no problem.</p>

  <div class="comments-body icr"> 
  <p>I think another important thing to note when organising your desk is to make sure your keyboard can be directly in front of your monitor. If you are trying to sit correctly and touch type you must sit directly in front of your keyboard. If your keyboard is not, as in a lot of cases, in front of your monitor you then have to turn your head.</p>

  <div class="comments-body andrew_pollack"> 
  <p>I use the original MS Natural keyboard.  None since work as well for me.  I&#39;ve had to get friends at MS to help me find them since they&#39;ve been replaced with newer (less good) models.</p>

<p>The distance to the mouse doesn&#39;t bother me a bit.  I&#39;m a computer programmer, but I&#39;m also a firefighter with very broad shoulders so the mouse isn&#39;t any further to the right than is my natural reach.  The full width of the Natural keyboard with number pad is not as wide as the distance between my elbows resting at my side.</p>

  <p>I work for the company, Humanscale, www.humanscale.com, which is exclusively all about ergonomics.  We design and manufacture top-of-the line ergonomic tools that will enhance the workstation, and bring a user&#39;s work TO the person, as opposed to you reaching for it.  For example, even with a great ergonomic chair, if you aren&#39;t sitting in it correctly and you need to lean forward to do your tasks each day, you will have improper back posture, therefore leading to back problems.  We manufacture more keyboard trays than anyone else on the market, that provide versatility and only let you have the neutral or downward wrist slope that this website describes.  We also have monitor arms to bring the monitor to you, while letting you do tasks on your desk.  Award winning seating solutions, and task lighting as well.</p>

<p>If you want more information, or you like the products you see from the Humanscale website, feel free to contact me directly at 212-725-4749 ext 147 and mention this website or DIGG&#39;s website for great offers.</p>

  <p>I have been struggling with RSI (hands and wrists) for some years now and my best advice is to take breaks (micro breaks and rest breaks) and limit the time in front of the computer.</p>

<p>Also make sure to visit a doctor that you are confident enough with as early as possible. I didn&#39;t and are probably worse of due to that.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there are any groups or lists (for &quot;indoor enthusiasts&quot;) for advices in these topics?</p>

  <p>Hey Now Jeff,</p>

<p>Great post. Because of you I&#39;ve improved my workstation ergonomics greatly. My neck used to hurt then I raised my monitor (my eye level is in the middle of my monitors now) no more pain there. I think it was because I was always looking down. I also bought the keyboard you recomend ms4000, like you said you spead so much on the other parts of your workstation why settle for a $10 keyboard. <br />
Thx.<br />

  <p>I learned how to use the mouse left handed (did not switch buttons).  About every couple weeks I switch hands.  It took about a week to get used to it but was well worth the effort.  </p>

<p>Now i can eat, drive and mouse with either hand!! :)</p>

  <div class="comments-body back_fan"> 
  <p>I&#39;m far too young to experiencing a back problem and yet I did when I threw a muscle shoveling snow a few years ago.  I went on a quest to improve my seating environment at work to try and make it more active.  I found a chair that really works for me.  It&#39;s called the Sit-A-Round (no link provided.  If you&#39;re interested in it then Google is your friend) ball chair and it provides an active seating surface.  The chair forces me to tighten the stomach muscles and sit up straight because failing to do results in a sore back.  I use it for about four hours a day then switch to a conventional chair.  The other desk item I appreciate is a tilt and elevate keyboard drawer.  I raise the drawer up and angle it down and away from me while on the ball, and then lower the drawer while in a regular chair.  The result?  I haven&#39;t had any back issues for a few years.  It probably helps that I&#39;ve added back exercises to my workout routine as well.</p>

<p>My other suggestion is to get a keyboard without a numeric keypad which will bring the mouse closer to your right hand.  The current keyboard design is antiquated when combined with a mouse since it shifts the entire body to left of centre of the monitor.</p>

  <p>This is interesting and is something I&#39;ve been interested in a while. I think the biggest problem for any and all, more so than just sitting at computer desks are laptops. There is no one way thats comfortable to work on a laptop unless you have an external mouse and keyboard.</p>

<p>The laptop sits too low for it to be at comfortable eye level which forces you to look down at it since its not comfortable to only shift your eyes downward (nor is it natural). If you put it at eye level, there is no way to have your arms in that position or sit that low in a chair and be comfortable. Essentially to properly work on a laptop, you really need an external keyboard  mouse which somewhat defeats the purpose of it. </p>

<p>Maybe in a future world, we can have holo-screens that project the image at an ideal eye level based on each person :) Boy that would be cool.</p>

helped as well (too much caffeine leaches it from bones and muscles).</p>

  <p>I also suffered from RSI, more specifically tennis and golfer&#39;s ellbow on both arms. After 3 years I&#39;m not cured, and i don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be completely free of symptoms. But thanks to my doctor and physiotherapist i can now handle prolongued sessions of work or computer play again, although i must be careful not to overdo it (eg. not playing 3-days in a row for 10+ hours straight).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve slowly upgraded my ergonomics, I got myself &quot;the keyboard of the gods&quot; (the latest MS Natural keyboard) but I&#39;ve also been using something i can HIGHLY recommend to anyone, symptoms or not:</p>

<p>The ErgoRest forearm support:<br />
<a href="http://www.ergorest.com/eng/products/picturematerial.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ergorest.com/eng/products/picturematerial.htm</a></p>

<p>It&#39;ll cost about 300-600$ but it&#39;s one of the things that, once you got used to it, you don&#39;t want to miss it. Ever!</p>

<p>If I&#39;m working on a computer that doesn&#39;t have forearm support i feel the strain on the ellbows and shoulder within 10 minutes of working. After 30-60 minutes i start to feel pain which lasts for hours, kind of like sore muscles.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some more info about Tennis elbow for those interested:<br />

<p>Ergonomics ...<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics</a></p>

<p><br />
About the overall workplace ergonomics i feel differently though. If you really try what they suggest, you end up sitting in a stiff and rather uncomfortable way and you actually have to force yourself into that position. I&#39;ve never seen anyone who can sit &quot;ergonomically&quot; as suggested for more than 10 minutes. There are some recommendations you should really consider, eg the approximate placement of your screen, or that you should look at it in a 90 angle.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also been mentioned that, similar to food, there is just no &quot;right&quot; way in ergonomics and the REAL issue is just to not sit too long in the same position. Lean back and slide into your chair for half an hour, then sit straight up with your ellbows on the table and your head resting in your hands (ok, that&#39;s only for reading Jeff&#39;s blog), etc. etc.</p>

<p>Diversification is the key, not trying to strictly adhere to the rules of ergonomics. Any continued stress on one part of your body is going to build up stress, so change how you sit often. That&#39;s my advice.<br />

  <p>I&#39;ve found myself that the one thing that did the most to ease RSI in my wrists was to change keyboards. I got a kinesis contoured keyboard back in 1997 and I&#39;ve never used anything else since. You get a lot of odd looks and everyone ooohs and aaahs over it for the first day, but other than that (and the admittedly heavy price tag - but hey, how expensive are new wrists?) it&#39;s a straightforward plug-n-play solution to the problem. </p>

  <p>I usually sit with my feet on the desk and keyboard in my lap (by far the most comfortable position I have found for long days of typing), but it does cause circulation problems in the legs, which is why frequent breaks are necessary. Fortunately, I&#39;m busily working on a solid nicotine addiction to keep me taking those breaks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I work for an extremely large corporation, and we have crappy chairs and little to work with in adjusting monitor height. In fact, the monitor itself would be intolerable had I not put it into a requirements list for a piece of software I wrote 8 years ago.</p>

<p>Our keyboards, mice, and monitors are typically the low end of whatever Dell offers with their computers, so I have my own MS Natural keyboard (an older one that I used to use at home before buying the MS wireless Natural), and an MS Trackball Explorer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-D68-00007-Trackball-Explorer/dp/B00005853Z)," rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-D68-00007-Trackball-Explorer/dp/B00005853Z),</a> which MS no longer makes (in fact, they don&#39;t make any trackballs last I checked). Using a mouse severely inflames the carpal tunnel in my right arm, and using a straight keyboard makes it impossible for me to type for more than 2 hours a day (due mostly to having broad shoulders, as far as I can tell, but then I don&#39;t really know how anyone can type on a straight keyboard for hours on end).</p>

<p>My only other problem is that I have a tall torso, which makes ergonomic seating harder to find (and makes non-adjustable seating very painful over long periods, such as airplane seats).</p>

This would be terrible for number entry. I can fly with my right hand on the number pad. My left would be very clumsy. You make a good point though about frequent mouse use and angles. Maybe it would be best to have a detached number pad and you could essentially have the num pad and mouse switch places. Of course, any one who spends most of their time with left hand on keyboard and right on mouse should/could simply nudge their keyboard to the left for the same effect.</p>

  <p>A little note on getting a new keyboard. From my experience it doesn&#39;t help me. I have tried both the Kinesis Contoured (as Mark Dennehy talked about) and a TypeMatrix 2030. Sure it might feel better for a while but at the end of the day you still need to push the buttons and that what hurts me.</p>

<p>My best advice (keyboard vise) is to get a comfortable keyboard and learn to type relaxed. Maybe do some remapping of keys (for example change Caps and Ctrl or Caps with Esc). Use both your hands for commands (I use Dvorak which makes for example copy paste a perfect two hand combination).</p>

  <p>OSHA&#39;s workstation guide is actually pretty terrible for the back and doesn&#39;t address real sources of RSI. If your forearms are only supported buy your elbows and wrists, then that means that 50% of the weight of your arm is on the wrist. A better arrangement is to place the keyboard at least eighteen inches in on the desk and rest your entire forearm on the desk. Keyboard trays only focus the pressure on the wrist. Also, minimizing your use of the mouse reduces strain on the wrists. Using a keyboard-centered text editor (emacs) has given me 8 years of pain free software development.</p>

<p>Finally, sitting straight up in your chair puts the greatest possible strain on your back. Most office chairs can lean back. Leaning back takes pressure off of the spine.</p>

  <p>(I&#39;m French.. Sorry about bad grammar)</p>

<p>Thank you for recalling those importants considerations regarding ergonomics.</p>

<p>I would add that what is really getting me tired or stressed along a computing day, is not the way I&#39;m sitting in front of the computer, but how things are goes with it...</p>

<p>I can spend a whole day comfortably installed in front of a computer: if that one is too slow, freezes for a couple of second, or more, requires me to wait frequently because too much swapping or a too slow broadband connection, then I get rapidly stressed at the point I must stop for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Because I am a developper it happens I need to task switch, launch, close, refresh / compile, get help...etc... I mean, I am using much more computer resource than a Word typing employee. I rarely have less than four or five apps running together : that&#39;s why windows arranging, shortcuts, ensuring smooth processing of repetitive operations - basically UI ergonomy - are as essential as physical ergonomic considerations.</p>

<p>Sure I&#39;m a little bit off-topic here, but on my mind, not only unresponsiveness / not adapted user interfaces or machine resources are pain in the ass, but causes concentration disruption, stress, frustration and loss of productivity. I dont have that problem at home because I can invest in what I need, but as a consultant working at customer location, this can be a problem sometimes.</p>

  <p>There is a little program you can try out, then buy if you like it, called Work Pace.  (I won&#39;t linkspam, it&#39;s at workpace dot com if you&#39;re interested in looking it up).  Basically, you fire it up and it monitors your use in the background.  It reminds you to take breaks periodically and runs through stretches you can do during the breaks to keep you from &quot;freezing&quot; in one position for too long.  You can pause the breaks, or you can even make them &quot;hard&quot; breaks in that it locks out the keyboard for a short length of time - essentially forcing a break.</p>

<p>A friend of mine told me about it.  He was having a bunch of physical symptoms from time slouched over the computer.  Once he started using it, he felt much better and was able to work more efficiently.  As he is also a manager and does many conference calls while on his computer - he has even told people during exceptionally long calls that it is time for a break and for stretching.  (I would&#39;ve loved to have seen the looks on people&#39;s faces the first time he did that!)</p>

<p>Oddly enough I never knew until I started using it, how much I was typing!!!  It&#39;s been another useful tool for me on long stints at the workstation.  </p>

  <p>Ergonomics are critical, no doubt about it.  When I was hired for a<br />
start-up, and was offered money to set up my home office, I spent most<br />
of it on an Aeron chair.  Now that I&#39;ve owned it a while, I know that<br />
I&#39;d never have regretted spending my own post-tax bux on one.  I&#39;ve <br />
tried half-a-dozen office supply store chairs and by comparison to<br />
the Aeron, every one becomes a torture rack long before I&#39;m ready <br />
to end a good coding session.  $800 (or $700+ online) seems sick<br />
for a single chair, but how much is a pain-free back worth?</p>

<p>Now, if you happen to overdo it, and have the tingling wrists or sore <br />
shoulder/neck/back, I cannot recommend this book highly enough:<br />
<a href="http://www.triggerpointbook.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.triggerpointbook.com/</a><br />
I actually bought it after my return from 1770-miles-on-back-roads<br />
motorcycle trip.  I thought &quot;Oh noes, I now have carpal tunnel!&quot;<br />
But I found the trigger points in my neck and massaged them several<br />
times a day as the book showed.  The first massage gave some immediate<br />
relief, and the tingling/numbness in my hands was gone within a few<br />
days.  I&#39;m not going to go into a long &quot;true believer&quot; rant here - <br />
just try it - the book is only $14 at amazon, so you won&#39;t be out<br />
much if it doesn&#39;t work for you.<br />

  <p>This is an excellent and succinct guide. However, each of the ergonomic trainings I&#39;ve attended say that pressure on the elbow and forearm leads to nerve damage. Nerves and tendons run along the underside of the forearm. As the fingers move, these nerves and tendons slide a little through the forearm. Pressure at those points end up rubbing them and causing various CTS-like symptoms.</p>

<p>To steffenj: I used the ErgoRest until I started getting tingling and numbness in my ring and pinkie fingers. The ErgoRest was damaging the nerves close to my wrist. The ErgoRest is designed to support the weight of the forearm to alleviate stress on the neck and shoulders. Unfortunately, its design puts pressure in a very delicate part of your forearm. A better way to avoid neck and shoulder stress is proper posture, changing position regularly, and taking frequent breaks. Rest the side of your hand on the &quot;wrist rest&quot; when you&#39;re not typing to take the weight of the forearms.</p>

  <p>Here are a few random things I&#39;ve learned to do:</p>

<p>1. Why does everyone recommend my eye level be the top of the screen? Most of the time I&#39;m looking at the bottom third of the screen, and would end up bending my neck down, or subconsciounly slouching.  I keep my monitor on top of a stack of old books.</p>

<p>2. It can be really cold in an office with air conditioning, and laminate desk tops can feel much colder than real wood.  I keep a thin sweater (it&#39;s a cardigan, not too dissimilar to Mr. Roger&#39;s famous cardigan actually) with long sleeves.  My hands can get really cold at the office.  At home I prefer a nice wood desk (and no AC, just fresh air). </p>

<p>3. You don&#39;t need an expensive chair, just one that promotes proper posture. After spending hours sitting in every chair in the store, I settled on the cheapest one.  One of the first things my new boss did when I started at my current job was tell me to go get whatever chair I wanted, paid for by the company of course.  He knows what&#39;s important!</p>

<p>4. Shift position frequently, but use good positions.  Sometimes I even stand up for a while, especially if I don&#39;t have to do a lot of typing and am just watching test results, for example.</p>

<p>5. Don&#39;t keep your keyboard centered, shift it over to the right a bit so the keypad is out of the way.  You may actually do this subconciously.</p>

<p>6. Go for a walk outside at least once a day. It will also wake you up and energize you for doing more work instead of feeling tired and full of slack.</p>

  <p>I have to look it up, but I do remember that a recent study showed that sitting layed back in an office chair, having your spine bend is better for the back. </p>

<p>As a computer programmer who spends 12-14 hours a day (every day) behind dual screens and a keyboard, I should have experienced pain and all, but no, nothing. Yes, once, when I started using the ergonomic position as illustrated in the graphic. As soon as I did that, I couldn&#39;t sit for over an hour, I had to rest for a longer period to get rid of the pains. </p>

<p>I never used ergonomic equipment. I like the el-cheapo wired keyboards and have used them for years (or the IBM model 30 keyboards!). I programmed a lot of an amiga 500 for years, never had a problem, and that keyboard isn&#39;t what you&#39;d call ergonomic. One thing I always did though: place the keyboard at least 20-30 centimeters away from the edge of the desk. This way, my arms are always at rest on the desk. No pains. </p>

<p>Switch positions in your chair during the hour, try to sit relaxed and comfortable. If the chair you&#39;re having doesn&#39;t make you say &quot;Oh yeah, this is comfortable&quot; get rid of it and buy one which does. </p>

<p>And tilt your hands a little so the pinkies are lower than the thumbs, like you&#39;re holding a steering wheel at 10-to-2 position but then without having your fingers bend of course. </p>

  <p>It seems to me that the rigid sitting position suggested in the ergonomics guidelines is just as damaging as any other position.  Doesn&#39;t it seem counter-intuitive that if ergonomics is supposed to be adjusting to how the body works then why suggest a single position model that applies to every body?  Or for that matter, if injuries are caused by repeated motion, why keep the body in a single position that encourages repeated motion?</p>

<p>Each body is different due to is physical dimensions, history, and physiology.  It makes sense to me to suggest more than one position throughout the day to change the range of motion and adjust the weight on different stress points.</p>

<p>The ergonomic consultants don&#39;t make things any better. It was typical that after a ergo-consultant made their &quot;visit&quot; to a call-center, nearly 20% of the work force took ridiculous amounts of FMLA but never commit to getting surgery to correct their new-found CTS.  I&#39;ll concede that there are valid repeated work related injuries, but it is very dubious how FMLA-related paid-time off seems to spike only after a consultant appears.  And it was very dubious how we bring in an ergo-consultant to correct the problem but only seemed to compound it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found massage is extremely helpful for RSI too, though ironically, it is hard on your hands to do it yourself.  After trying a lot of different massage tools, I found the Armaid (www.armaid.com) which finally got rid of my wrist pain.  It costs $100, which seemed expensive at first glance, but on further thought, I realized that $100 is the cost of two hours from a massage therapist for a tool that I can use for an unlimited amount of time.  After using it, I knew that it was cheap at the price.</p>

  <p>Zac&#39;s dead-on.  Laptops are a nightmare from both an ergonomic and developer productivity perspectives.  A single screen, too low to be at eye level, a cumbersome pointing device that costs serious times to use,  and a keyboard that&#39;s too small.  A nightmare.  </p>

<p>When I see &quot;happy&quot; developers using a laptop, I suspect they&#39;re probably not any good, simply because if they don&#39;t feel their productivity is  limited by their hardware, their baseline level of productivity is probably not all that impressive.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting link; thanks for posting it. Don&#39;t take any of this as dogma-- I think a lot of the ergonomic advice is *relatively* true, plus or minus 20 percent. It&#39;s not a science, so feel free to adjust to whatever feels right to you.</p>

<p> Laptops are a nightmare from both an ergonomic and developer productivity perspectives</p>

<p>So the lesson is to use an external monitor and keyboard if you&#39;re going to be on a laptop for any length of time.</p>

<p> Basically, you fire it up and it monitors your use in the background. It reminds you to take breaks periodically and runs through stretches you can do during the breaks to keep you from &quot;freezing&quot; in one position for too long</p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with this type of program. One client of ours has this program mandated on all their PCs. Its intentions are good, but I personally find its interruptions INCREDIBLY annoying and more than a little patronizing. But then I&#39;m the same guy who turns off all IM notifications, too, so maybe I&#39;m not the right audience.</p>

<p>The web is filled with sites for this, but I find the wrist stretch (elbow straight, pull back finger, then push down hand) and calf/hamstring stretches are really important. Our legs were not really designed for a lifetime of sitting and after a few sessions with the massage therapist in February, I can tell you that tension accumulates in the calf/hamstring region at a pretty crazy rate.</p>

Endless rearranging of my work environment according to various ergonomic guides never had much impact on my neck, shoulder and wrist pain. It was only when I tried the Alexander Technique and become more acutely aware of just how much unnecessary tension and effort I was using at the computer that I was able to eliminate the pain and discomfort.<br />
Before coughing out the dough for various ergonomic products it might be worth having a session of Alexander Technique or Feldenkrais (mentioned by Tim above), you may find that you don&#39;t really need to change that much about your setup after all.</p>

  <p>The ultimate computer desk should be one that conforms to a person, people are not blocks, so why should our desks be?  The best position is the &#39;nuetral&#39; rest position, which you can see in photos of astronauts sleeping; every joint moves to it&#39;s natural resting position.  A chair should be formed around this position, some companies claim &#39;nuetral position&#39; chairs, but they always sit the occupants bolt upright, as was cited by another poster recent studies show that is not a healthy position.  Common sense should dictate this as well, a bolt upright position puts all of your upper body weight on your lower spine, which is weak, this is why the most frequent injury of stunt men who jump cars and helicoptor pilots, who also sit bolt upright, is lower back injuries.  A proper seating position, and &#39;nuetral&#39; position should be one partially inclined so the seat back takes some of the weight of the upper body.  With a reclined seating position however, the nuetral rest position of the fore arms is not horizontal, it is tilted slightly upward.  I built an inclined sloping desktop which wraps around you like a drafting table with a notch cut into it and combined it with a reclining office chair and *all* of my wrist back and neck pain went away.  I make and sell these in my spare time and they can attatch to any desk in a few seconds, check them out if interested www.ergoslope.com</p>

I spend most of my day in a terminal/console/command-line utility ssh&#39;d in to various servers.  When you have this application maximized to fit the screen, most of what you do is on the very bottom line; the line where you need to type commands.  This forced me to have to look down at the bottom edge of my screen.  I ended up putting a couple thick computer books under my monitor to raise it up.  This has helped so much with my next strain; strain I had just kind of accepted.</p>

  <p>Michael,</p>

<p>Many people do sit in a bolt upright position which may well place too much strain on the lower back. However the best solution, rather then sitting in a partial reclined position, is to sit naturally upright. When none of the muscles in the torso and around the spine are overly tensed the torso will naturally be upright due to the effect of tensegrity within the body (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity)." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity).</a> This article (by biomechanist Stephen Levin) describes how spine exhibits the properties of a tensegrity system:  <br />

<p>When your spine is naturally upright the weight from your upper body is not put on your lower spine, instead the musculature in your torso is available to support this weight ensuring that your spine is relatively free from strain.<br />

  <p>We tend to be amused by old advertisements showing a family enthusiastically huddled around a 7 inch diameter TV screen. I sometimes wonder whether in 20-30 years people will laugh at our advertisements presenting persons scrunched over laptop screens/keyboards as &quot;a model of efficiency.&quot;</p>

<p>At the same time, skepticism about the &quot;eye height&quot; doctrine appears well-founded. The article below presents advice which appears to be: a) backed by physiological research; and b) sensible as explained. It has certainly set the baseline for my thinking and experimentation. Dennis Ankrum explains that the 15 degree eye declination might be a resting position for distance viewing, but computer work is close work, where a range of 15 to 50 degrees downward is closer to resting. A related observation: when we want to work close, we tend to look downward (i.e., work closer to the chin than the forehead), and even at that it is easier to accomodate for distance when working at arm&#39;s length than closer. </p>

<p>Other details from the same link:  Glare is a function of contrast in illumination -- e.g., watch out for bright direct light in your field of view. The top of display should be farther from the eye than the bottom of a display (consider how we hold a book to read). And against the &quot;bolt upright&quot; posture -- &quot;the next posture is the best posture.&quot;</p>

  <p>Thank you for your post. I know all the ergonomics advices. A lot of them work, but as with best practices, you have to see what you&#39;re comfortable with as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly long (1m97 / 6&quot;5.5&#39;&#39;) and not very muscly, and so, likely to strain things easily.</p>

<p>1. I&#39;ve got a knee chair (the simplest model at <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=enq=knee+chairgbv=2" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=enq=knee+chairgbv=2</a> - cost EUR20ish 10 years back and still works). I claim that it has saved my back, as it requires you to keep your back straight, instead of letting it rest on the backrest.</p>

<p>2. I&#39;ve adapted my desk to me, not otherwise. What I did was sit down in my comfortable chair (the knee thing) and kept my back straight up, upper arms straight down and lower arms at 90deg angle (with a normal chair also your hip and knee angles shoulde be 90deg). Then measure the height of the underside of your underarms (get help from someone) and get this height precisely. For me it was 83 cm.</p>

<p>83 cm desks don&#39;t exist so I built my own. My monitor (CRT) was on my computer (desktop model, not tower - but anything will work) I think THAT, not the chair, was the best investment I ever made. Due to moving, I now work at a much lower desk, and I can&#39;t sit at the computer for more than 1 or 2 hours.</p>

<p>So: get a good chair - sit well and measure arm height - adjust desk.</p>

<p>3. At my work my chair and desk were too low. I&#39;ve asked for a raised chair and a movable desk. Got the chair (is a charm) and the desk. Desk is still 1.5 cm too low, and I can feel it. I think in ergonomics you have to measure in at least half centimeters, maybe less. However, do what&#39;s comfortable, not what&#39;s &quot;best&quot; according the formula. Nobody is equal, and relative body part lenghts have actually quite much variation.</p>

<p>4. Drink a lot of water. It will help against RSI. The secret: you have to go to the toilet every hour or so, so you move. I actually got the advice to drink LESS (water) from my doctor (drank 3.5 litres per day).<br />
Sugar is actually a dehydratant, so sugared drinks, like coke or lemonade, will actually dehydrate you - this also goes for sugar-replaced (light/diet) drinks, and appearently for (unsugared) coffee (though I don&#39;t know that, don&#39;t drink coffee). I try to drink at most 2 glasses of sugared drink a day - however during nightly sessions I occasionally do 2 bottles of coke :-P</p>

  <p>To spare your wrists: ergonomic keyboards and minimal mousing around, and relax.<br />
To spare your back: never EVER sit still. At least not for more than a couple of minutes. Change position, move around, take a walk and think about a problem, stand up. Relax.<br />
To spare your neck: have the screen in front of you and at eye-level. Relax.<br />
To spare your eyes: don&#39;t look at the screen so much. Relax.<br />
To spare your life: keep it simple, stupid!  (and relax)</p>

  <p>Fantastic post, we&#39;ve been advocates for a long time of needing to consider ergonomics.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve done a lot of work recently with programmers and developers and many of them have found the evoluent mouse really useful, it&#39;s a vertical mouse (so a bit like you are shaking someone&#39;s hand) and it takes a lot of pressure off the wrist.  Available left or right handed!</p>

<p>In terms of ergonomics for laptops, the best thing to do is to buy a laptop stand (to get the screen at the approx the right height for you) and use a plug in keyboard and mouse.  If you travel a lot it might be worth looking at a really light weight one, so it&#39;s not going to weigh your laptop bag down (and causing an ergonomic nightmare when you are walking around)</p>

<p>Also best advice is still to take regular breaks from your PC!  And follow Jeff&#39;s excellant diagrams to setting up your workstation.</p>

  <p>I haven&#39;t read all of the comments, so I don&#39;t know wether anyone has brought this up yet. But those pictures look disproportionate.</p>

<p>The fore arms on this bloke are at least a good hand-span too long, when you take into consideration the various angles that should be involved, and the points of view. So the positions they are showing are simply not possible - that&#39;s assuming, of course, that your not closer to the ape end of evolution tree...<br />

  <p> What are the ergonomics for using laptops? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re working on a laptop full time, consider getting a generic laptop &quot;dock&quot; station, such as the Logitech Alto. It raises the laptop screen and gives you a real full size keyboard.</p>

  <p>I always tell people to get the Knoll Chadwick chair - especially if they think that they like the Aeron... It&#39;s designed by the same guy as the Aeron, but it&#39;s updated with the latest technology. Fewer adjustments and more sensitive to your individual movements. VERY comfortable, and built to be ergonomically correct. Check it out at www.theknollstore.com</p>

  <p>For the past two years, I&#39;ve stood up at my desk.  In my last job I actually was given an architect&#39;s table that I could slide up to belly-button level.  I put my monitor on a milk crate, and my laptop in front of that so I could use the montor screen as a second monitor, the two monitors stacked vertically.</p>

<p>At first I found that my lower back did not like it much, but it has gotten a lot stronger.  I also find that I don&#39;t go into my post-lunch food coma as easily.</p>

<p>I think I just got tired of the idea that the doc asks what you do, you say &quot;computer programmer&quot;, and he says, &quot;okay&quot; and automatically checks &quot;sedentary&quot;.</p>

  <p>Hi</p>

<p>I&#39;m just replying to Jason questions about where to get a good chair, I thought it might be worth while giving a few tips on what to look out for in a good chair.</p>

<p>1. Get a chair that can have a forward tip in the seat, helps to keep the pelvis aligned,and then this keeps the natural curve in the lower spine.</p>

<p>2. Get a chair that has a backrest that you can independent adjust so that you can get a good angle on it</p>

<p>3. Make sure if you are tall that the chair can go high enough for you (feet firmly on the floor, chair as high as it will go, then arms at a comfortable right angle to your desk).</p>

<p>4.  The bit you actually sit on should be about hands width away from your knees, too close and it will encourage you to adopt a slouch position or sit to far forward so that you get no support from the back.</p>

<p>In terms of what&#39;s the best chair for your budget, really depends on what your budget is:</p>

<p>The rolls royce of ergonomic chairs is the RH range, but it&#39;s in the same price league as the Aeron chair (but much better ergonomics wise)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.posturepeople.co.uk/Results1.asp?Category=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.posturepeople.co.uk/Results1.asp?Category=10</a></p>

<p>A really good chair if you are a sloucher is the Axia Pro, perfect if you work long hours in front of a PC - and the way it&#39;s built makes if very hard for you to adopt a slouching position</p>

<p><a href="http://www.posturepeople.co.uk/Details.asp?Category=55ProductID=101" rel="nofollow">http://www.posturepeople.co.uk/Details.asp?Category=55ProductID=101</a></p>

<p>A good budget option is the Nomique range, has a lot of adjusts and you can buy small, medium or large sizes to suit your frame, also has injection moulded foam - which means the foam gives more support and is more comfortable than cheaper chairs on the market.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.posturepeople.co.uk/Results1.asp?Category=56" rel="nofollow">http://www.posturepeople.co.uk/Results1.asp?Category=56</a></p>

<p>The best thing to go to a showroom where you can try several chairs out to see what it really the best for you.  </p>

<p>Hope this helps<br />

  <p>Interesting stuff ergonomics.<br />
Since are bodies are designed to move it is best to have an environment that is flexible. Learn how to adjust your chair at least the back angle. Sometimes you may like an upright posture, sometimes a reclined.<br />
If you learn where the back paddle is in space you can make changes without interrupting your work.<br />
I use an electric sit stand desk that is useful. I find that I not only go from sitting to standing but I also make small height changes <br />
to get my torso more upright and to reduce slumping.</p>

<p>If you wear bi-focals be aware of monitor height. Usually place monitor as low as possible to reduce a backward slanted head posture.</p>

<p>I have been doing ergonomic evaluations and designing products for 20 years and still find this whole field interesting. You may want to check out this site for ergonomic products and information on stretching at your desk. www.kareproducts.com</p>

  <p>The increasing popularity of laptops is bad news regarding ergonomics (suboptimal viewing angle - neck strain, small screen size, highly reflective screens* - eye strain, wrist positioning - RSI problems). </p>

<p>If you&#39;re using a laptop I strongly recommend to invest in an external monitor/keyboard/mouse combination if you spend a significant amount of time at your desk.</p>

<p>* whoever thought this up should be forced to work in one of our offices for a year. Fortunately, the business lines from the major manufacturers are still available with anti-glare coatings - we won&#39;t buy anything else.</p>

  <p>I developed RSI in both wrists (tendonitis) more than a decade ago, and I immediately contacted an ergonomic specialist working for our city government (a large U.S. city). (His job was to approve all types of equipment purchased for employee use that could potentially cause RSI. The Microsoft natural keyboard described above, which was initially on the City&#39;s approved list, was later removed, because they began hearing complaints of elbow pain from those who used it on a regular basis.) He recommended that I purchase the Kinesis contour keyboard and articulating arm supports (such as ErgoRest Arm supports). Together, they made it possible for me to get back to work. I&#39;ve used both ever since, for several hours nearly every day. Whenever I attempt to use a regular computer keyboard for 15 minutes or more, wrist pain begins to develop. I head back to my Kinesis and the ErgoRests, and the pain is gone.</p>

  <p>I get much better results with </p>

<p>1) my chair seat angled down a little, to open up my abdomen</p>

<p>2) my monitor(s) higher than recommended - centre of the monitor level with my eye: forces my head up to align my spine</p>

<p>I have also (to great hilarity among my co-workers) taken all the numberpad keys off my keyboard, aand blu-tacked my trackball onto the now-vacant space so I don&#39;t have to reach off to the side for it.</p>

  <p>I highly recomend RESIGUardi, this is software that forces you to take breaks, it blanks out the screen, great stuff! </p>

<p>There are other software out there, but this one I liked. </p>

I&#39;m interested to hear people&#39;s opinion about the position of the screen. I don&#39;t like looking down, I like to have the middle of the screen at eye level, but I&#39;m told this is wrong. But if I constantly look down, I feel neck ache.. any ideas?<br />
