<cite>Computer: Bit Slices from a Life</cite> was converted to HTML for the
Web by <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/">Frank da&nbsp;Cruz</a>
in May 2003 for the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/">Columbia
University Computing History Project</a> with permission and collaboration
of Dr. Grosch.  This is a manuscript of the 3rd edition, a work in progress
sponsored by the US <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science
Foundation</a>.  The first edition was published by Third Millenium Books,
Novato, California, in 1991 and as noted below, copyright was reassigned to
the author upon breakup of that company.  As to conditions for use, Dr. Grosch
says <i>"make sure it's as generous as possible.  The only restriction I
really want is, no alterations, or elisions which change [my] intentions."</i>
To this I would add that the definitive, complete, and up-to-date Web copy of
this work is to be found in the following location; copies at other sites
might be dated, incomplete, or altered:

This is a simple, monolothic, and
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validated</a> HTML file, 1.7MB in size,
representing over 500 printed pages, self-contained, fully searchable, and
displayable by any browser.  The only cautions for viewing, other than sheer
size, are the presence of several tables, which browsers such as Lynx might
not format correctly, and the fact that it contains a fair number of words in
German, French, and other languages containing accented characters, coded in
ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1, properly announced.

<p>

The <a href="#index">Index</a> (which applies only through Chapter 25) is
fully linked, and page anchors have been added through the end of Chapter 25,
and correspond to the printed pages of the first edition (which has 24
chapters and no index).
Page numbers appear inline, representing the <i>beginning</i> of the
corresponding printed page, as <font color="red">[-<i>xx</i>-]</font> (in red

THREE YEARS AGO I finished the 55th chapter of COMPUTER.
<p>
[not yet finalized]

<h3><a name="p2e">PREFACE<br>
to second edition</a></h3>

<p>

EIGHT YEARS AGO I sent the first 23 chapters of <cite>COMPUTER</cite> to
press.  I wanted to go on; I had toured Europe in the early Sixties, and had
other stories from those days that historians and veterans would want to hear.
But as I began again, a family tragedy intervened, and I set the work aside.

<p>

When I returned to the United States I brought with me the remains of my huge
original archive: my 1962 call reports to Control Data, my flight logs, my
appointment (and hotel/restaurant) lists, some of my expense account carbons.
Cautiously I began to reconstruct what had happened to me and to the
burgeoning world of computers from mid-1959 on.  It went slowly.

<p>

Then I was awarded a National Science Foundation grant.  It was to me as an
individual investigator (unusual), and it permitted me to move from New Mexico
to Washington, where I had the resources of the Library of Congress and of the
Smithsonian within walking distance.  The publishers of the first edition had
broken up, and courteously relinquished the copyright.  I decided to continue
the material more or less seamlessly, and to call the result a second edition
of COMPUTER rather than a separate book.

<p>

What follows is the result.  There are no pictures this time, although I have
many more to display.  The pagination of the bound volume is preserved.
Errors that I am aware of in the first edition have been corrected, although I
am sure there are others, and not a few in the new material.  The table of
contents and the chronology have been extended.  And at the very end I have
appended the index to the first 23 chapters, which Underwood-Miller did not
print.

<p>

Providing this edition on CD/ROM, uncoded and uncompressed, means that
chapters or sections of the book can be downloaded and subjected to full-text
search.  This is a poor substitute for a careful index, and I apologize.  If I
ever complete the 1967-87 years, which is possible but not too likely, I will
then undertake a full index.

<p>

In a few months Y2K will be upon us.  To look back from that cusp to a younger
and happier time, when anything seemed possible and the world of computing was
just opening out, is a great privilege, and a very great pleasure.

<h3><a name="p1e">PREFACE<br>
to first edition</a></h3>

<p>

THIS BOOK was to be an autobiography.  I was made into a computer fifty years
ago.  I was the second scientist ever hired by IBM, and I watched the Watsons
on Olympus, and Bill Norris and Ken Olsen and Gene Amdahl, and a thousand
great commercial and academic figures.  Later, for three amusing years, I was
the top Federal computer honcho, and escaped to be editor of the major trade
newspaper.  I was a charter member of the world's first and largest
professional computer society, and the first national president ever elected
by membership petition.  I worked in Monaco and Switzerland and the
Netherlands when I was too controversial to be employable in the U.S., and I
consulted for the largest and best Japanese computer company.

<p>

And I had four wonderful wives, and a hundred lovely supporters, and terrific
friends on five continents - and some very lively enemies.  Perhaps I could do
for the computer trade what Casanova did for Venetian diplomacy?  Only problem
was, his story ran to twelve volumes!

<p>

Or I could do a history: a history of the computer times I had lived through.
I had mountains of books and papers and clippings to help me crosscheck
against the increasingly divergent recollections of others, and could
certainly make a useful contribution to the unfolding story of that
intelligence amplifier everybody now calls the computer.  Well, it looked like
a lot of work, and not much fun for me or for the readers.

<p>

For a while I thought about doing an ALICE.  Lewis Carroll is a favorite
preceptor for just about everybody in the computer wonderland, and the thought
of Watson Senior shouting "Off with her head!" at every married IBM woman
[1948] was very appealing.  I could see myself saying "Good-bye, feet!" as I
grew into a manager - oh, the parallels were evocative.  But I had to admit
the idea was pretty far-fetched.

<p>

Then I wondered about PLAYER PIANO.  Kurt Vonnegut did his satire on
automation so well; I had gone to GE's Association Island [1955] and had sat
under the elm that was transformed into a ruined oak at the end of his yarn.
As Schenectady became Ilion, so could Endicott become, say, Watsonville, and
the shoe workers could parade past the IBM factory shouting "While you're
thinking, we're drinking!" just as they had in real life.  But the themes
would have to be spare, or the satire would be blunted.  What I wanted to do
was to weave an exceedingly rich and complex fabric, with a warp of computer
history but a filling, a woof, of wives and friends and travels.  No, Vonnegut
didn't look much easier than Carroll.

<p>

Think of my magnificently complicated life as a huge multi-dimensional data
bank.  The totality is the autobiography - millions and millions of bytes.
Slice it along the time axis and you have histories: big computers, software,
the evolution of standards.  Slice it another way and you have applications:
science, or banking, or air defense; another, and you have organizations.
What I have finally chosen to do is to slice it so as to feature wonderful
people: some of them famous, like the great Vons - von Braun, von Karman, von
Neumann; some of them tremendously significant but not so well known, like
L.J. Comrie and Wallace Eckert; some of them just vivid and exciting, and
important to me because they were wonderfully human if not historic.

<p>

<a name="[-ix-]"><font color="red">[-ix-]</font></a>
I aspire to Magic Realism - a picture somewhat larger and much clearer than
life.  But let me reassure readers, and future thesis perpetrators: I have not
given "...to airy nothing/ A local habitation and a name."  All the things in
my stories actually happened.  The Old Man really did order the support
columns removed from the SSEC room.  The television link between the jet
engine test cells in Lynn and the GE 704 really did click only a few moments
before the generals and the airline presidents arrived.  Tom Junior really did
walk through the sacred halls of Armonk carrying a whisky carton, and with a
duck in it!

<p>

I have not sharpened the joys and the sorrows; there was genuine gold and
genuine guilt.  And when I praise Grace Hopper and Gerhard Neumann, or
criticize Vin Learson, it is from the heart.  I lived in vivid times.

<p>

Finally, there is no point to disclaimers.  The characters in my story are
real, every one of them.  Some are not identified precisely.  That is not an
accident.  And some, some of the best ones like Comrie and Watson Senior and
Wallie Eckert, have gone beyond my praise.  As with all the others, wives and
lovers and pets, friends and enemies and quizzical bystanders, I've drawn them
as I remember them, with no fear and much, much favor.

He would be 74 next month, although no one in IBM dared to mention the number
to him.  The family, the large and devoted family, would of course celebrate -
very privately, and without emphasizing his age.  In his sharp but
nevertheless sentimental way he was looking forward to the dedication next
week as a major present - a recognition by devoted employees of his foresight,
his vigor, his determination to make "the IBM", as he called his empire, an
even more important leader in American and world business.

<p>

This was Thomas John Watson, "Mr. Watson" when addressed directly, "T.J." in
most third-person mentions inside the company and nearby, "The Old Man"
informally and pejoratively.  The use of "Watson Senior", to distinguish the
emperor from the heir apparent, would not be in frequent use for another five
or six years; indeed, it was really a coined label for the convenience of
media people and historians rather than something used in IBM.

<p>

It was Thursday, January 22, 1948.  Watson and his entourage stood inside the
world's second giant electronic calculator (we say "computer" today, but more
about that a little later).  Three months ago the space had contained The
French Bootery, a handsome and quite successful shoe shop catering to 57th
Street ladies and would-be ladies.  From the ground floor of the building
adjoining IBM World Headquarters, a building owned or at least controlled by
IBM, the Bootery had been summarily moved across the street - these things
were much easier in 1947 - and the cavern remaining had been miraculously
transformed, with walls of plate glass and stainless steel shielding some
12,000 full-sized vacuum tubes and 20,000 special relays: the SSEC.

<p>

Watson, his vice presidents and sycophants, and senior technical people
nervously awaiting judgement, were clustered around the free-standing units on
the raised floor of the lovely room.  A little further back, a gaggle of less
senior engineers and scientists was tensely watching the action, available to
answer questions or open and close panels and doors.  The giant control unit
<a name="[-2-]"><font color="red">[-2-]</font></a>
covered with hundreds of identical but handsomely labeled
switches, was "manned" by Betsy Stewart, appearing quite at ease and in
command of the situation.  Behind her were attractively cased line printers,
and fairly close were repackaged punched card readers and gang punches, and
some special units.

<p>

Questions, many questions, and answers; none about money, for T.J. assumed
that others were seeing to it that enough had been provided and none wasted.
Not much about the press; T.J. knew that they would flock when he beckoned.
Would the demonstration impress the important men and women who had been
invited for the dedication?  Would the IBM creation outshine the ENIAC?  How
would it compare to the machine Mr. Watson had donated to ungrateful Harvard,
back before electronics?

<p>

There was a pause.  Those of us away from the center of Watsonian attention,
standing near the inscription which offered the huge device to Science - over
the famous Watson signature, of course - began to relax a bit.  T.J. had not
appeared to notice that the machine was not doing anything important, although
those of us who had been close to him on other occasions could not be sure.
He had eyes in the back of his head, and the memory of an elephant.  True, he
was not supposed to understand much about electronics - on the other hand,
somebody had supported a good deal of experimentation before the war, and was
authorizing the hiring of bright young guys from the radar shops of MIT.  The
recent upsurge, including the giant machine we stood inside of, was arguably
the brainchild of Wallace Eckert and John McPherson.  But the pre-war patents,
now embodied inside the walls of the new calculator, had been funded by The
Old Man.

<p>

Anyhow, no embarrassing comments.  He assumed everything would be ready by
next Tuesday - after all, he had ordered that it be so.  We were not so sure,
but we were all committed, seniors and juniors alike.

<p>

The emperor looked around one last time.  The whole session, although vitally
important to the fantastic future of IBM, had taken less than an hour.  "A
great credit to the IBM," he said, and all the vice presidential heads nodded
in unison.  "Science will move ahead more rapidly.  Our universities and our
government will surely benefit, and world peace and world trade will be
fostered as people from other countries visit and perhaps use the calculator."

<p>

"There is just one thing," he said somewhat off-handedly.  "The sweep of this
room is hindered by those large black columns down the center.  Have them
removed before the ceremony." And out he marched, tailed by his quivering
followers!

<p>

Well, we had four days, counting the weekend.  Also - slight complication -
those columns concealed the steel uprights that held up the twenty-story
building.  Even for Mr. Watson, no one could remove them.  Now, that elephant
memory was selective.  Later that year I watched him order one of his
cleverest inventors, Pete Luhn, to build terminals and connect them to a big
relay calculator "on a lower floor", so that the "research area" would be more
attractive - not bad, in 1948, and from a 74-year-old! I asked Pete later what
he would do.  Would he propose a hundred-man effort, abandon his current
projects, and set out after The Old Man's casual dream?

<p>

"No," said he, "he'll never mention it again unless I bring it up.  Of course,
<a name="[-3-]"><font color="red">[-3-]</font></a>
if he gets mad at me about something else, even ten years from now, he'll
remember he told me to do it - and that I didn't.  And tell everybody nearby I
disobeyed a direct order."

<p>

The cooler heads assumed that T.J. would forget the whole thing.  Cynics like
me figured he just wanted to keep the troops on their toes; he knew very well
those columns held the building up.  On the other hand, non-tech types who had
watched the old boy in action reminded us newcomers that he might use
noncompliance as an excuse to erase some poor soul who had "failed" him
before, perhaps - looking hard at me - by omitting to invite someone to one of
Mr. Watson's celebrations (I had just done the scientific invitations for the
dedication).

<p>

Inspiration!  Wasn't mine; I seem to remember a chap named Macnamara, who was
doing the goodies: programs and table favors and souvenirs for the luncheon,
and discreet corsages for the two or three lady guests.  There was to be a
fancy four-color brochure about the machine, and it was to feature a big
centerfold view of the main area.  We junked the whole stack (how I now wish I
had had a copy!) and, over a frantic weekend, printed a revised edition.
Alas, it had to be in sepia; even for IBM the colored option was out of the
question.  The centerfold photograph was carefully retouched, and all traces
of the offending columns were removed.

<p>

I loved it; the semantics boys were right - there is Reality, and then there
are representations of reality, and layer upon layer of more remote imagery.
The columns were still there on opening day, and they stayed there for the
life of the machine, and on into the golden days when a 701 lived there.  A
major Saturday Evening Post story published later in the year has a fine
colored illustration of the area, with the columns front and center.  But the
history books show a beautiful room without columns - the room Watson ordered!

<p>

What was I doing in the back of that room, and why had I been the one to work
up the scientific invitation list for the unveiling of the SSEC, the Selective
Sequence Electronic Calculator? It was the third giant machine of the Babbage
line, and like the first, the ill-fated Automatic Sequence Controlled
Calculator which Watson had had built to Howard Aiken's specifications four
years before, it was to be dedicated to the greater glory of Science and -
unlike the ASCC, now universally called the Harvard Mark I - to the glory also
of the International Business Machines Corporation.  The second giant, and the
first to use primitive Forties electronics, had been the ENIAC, cobbled
together by Pres Eckert and John Mauchly in the Moore School of Electrical
Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania, in dumb downtown Philadelphia.

<p>

ENIAC added nothing at all to IBM prestige, although the builders had
reluctantly been forced to use IBM gang punches as input/output devices.  What
it had done, by appearing on the front page of the New York Times - the first
such device ever to do so - was to make The Old Man grind his teeth so
ferociously that people, dozens of people, shivered as far away as Endicott,
home of the IBM "research" laboratory.

<p>

I was the second scientist ever to be hired by IBM, and an anomaly in a dozen
other ways.  In later chapters I'll tell the details of how it happened; the
important points are that I had been a computer since the autumn of 1935,
<a name="[-4-]"><font color="red">[-4-]</font></a>
was
an authentic member of the same tribe of scientists as Wallace Eckert, and had
responded instantly to the announcement in SCIENCE that he, Eckert - no
relation to Pres Eckert, by the way - had been hired in March 1945 to head a
new Department of Pure Science in IBM, and to establish the Watson Scientific
Computing Laboratory at Columbia University.

<p>

Remember the name ENIAC? That acronym stood for Electronic Numerical
Integrator And Calculator.  Almost every current article about that incredible
machine, with its 18,000 highly-fallible vacuum tubes, and the thousandfold
increase in speed it brought to major calculations, says "Computer".  But it
wasn't so; from the mid-Nineteenth century until about 1952, a computer was a
human being who did computations (and associated technical tasks in
laboratories and observatories).  He - or more often, she (I married one) -
used printed math tables and calculating devices.  The people who didn't do it
full time, or who used slide rules and planimeters and such, usually didn't
use the label.  I did, and was quite proud to have been made a computer by a
more experienced member of the clan, in the mid-Thirties.  All the Cs in ENIAC
and EDVAC and EDSAC and UNIVAC stood for Calculator, which is what we
computers used, along with Marchants and Fridens and Monroes and Brunsvigas,
until the Defense Calculator became the IBM Type 701.

<p>

Eckert hired me in May of 1945, and the Watson Lab had been under way for some
months - and both the European and the Pacific wars deliriously concluded -
before the ENIAC announcement.  Although I had been busy shaping up and
running the computing side of the enterprise, I had helped Wallace interview
his second senior employee, a relieved refugee from Howard Aiken's sweat shop.
He was one of the two or three people in the whole world who had managed a
giant machine, the one at Harvard.  Aiken, the irascible boss, and Grace
Hopper, nowadays everybody's favorite computer person but then known
principally as the co-author of the handsome Harvard Mark I operating manual,
were his only counterparts.

<p>

Eckert wanted Rex - Robert R. Seeber - because he expected to build another
giant.  Watson had told him IBM intended to do so, and had indicated
vigorously how unhappy he was with Aiken and Harvard.  Now, Eckert had good
lines into MIT, and although not himself at ease with even old-fashioned
electronics, knew that the new radar techniques developed so quickly there
(and in Britain, and at the Bell Labs, neither of which were readily
accessible to Watson and his business-machines-oriented crew) would be the
building blocks of future calculators.

<p>

In parallel to his recruiting Seeber, and IBM's third scientist, Hilleth
Thomas of Thomas-Fermi statistics fame, Eckert set out to pick up three or
four youngsters, hot off the radar griddle, to work on long range projects at
the Watson Lab rather than in IBM shops in Endicott and Poughkeepsie.  He was
not at all an empire builder - it would have been good for IBM, and certainly
for me, if he had been.  He simply planned to stockpile some advanced
technology against the time when Mr. Watson might need it.  When ENIAC hit the
front pages, he was ready with Seeber, but the pulse-electronics boys were not
tuned up, and the SSEC had to be built with big bottles and old circuits.  Out
of that tiny specialized group finally came NORC, the Naval
<a name="[-5-]"><font color="red">[-5-]</font></a>
Ordnance Research Calculator - the very first supercomputer.  It just took a
while!

<p>

Watson pushed the "start" button.  He picked Frank Hamilton, who had been
Number Two on the ASCC.  "Put every IBM resource to work, Mr. Hamilton.  I
want the new machine to be faster than that one in Pennsylvania, more capable
than the one we gave to Harvard.  I want it to be installed here at World
Headquarters, in one year.  And I want it to be available to the scientific
world, not hidden away at a selfish university or at a military installation."

<p>

Frank realized how horrendous the task would be.  But he was a big, handsome,
forceful engineer - a natural leader, with a team in place in the Endicott
laboratories and a clear idea of what other projects he could dip into.  It
was a great challenge.  Besides, you did not say no to the boss - not when he
gave you an, ahem, opportunity like that.

<p>

Although I did not yet see it clearly, this was my first exposure to the IBM
Contract.  During good behavior, you had a life job, at non-decreasing pay,
and with great perquisites, ranging from membership in lovely dollar-a-year
country clubs to suites on the Queen Mary, provided:

<ol type="a">
<li>you accepted any job offered you
<li>in any location whatever, and
<li>thanked everybody concerned for the wonderful opportunity.
</ol>
<p>

Good behavior included not growing hair on your face, not wearing colored
shirts, not taking a drink in public (one very senior executive, who
frequently occupied those Queen Mary suites, was to die two years later from a
hobnailed liver), and never contradicting The Old Man or his direct
representatives.  I did all four in my first two years in the company, and for
a while lived to tell the tale.  What got to me in the end was c); I kissed
the whip very poorly indeed.

<p>

Hamilton and Eckert and Seeber settled the specs in just a few days.  There
had been a series of memos and meetings in 1945, and not just desultory ones.
John McPherson, then Director of Engineering and approximately Eckert's boss,
had made heavy contributions - intellectual and technical ones, not
managerial; you will see much more of him in later chapters.  The old-timers
who had built the Harvard machine and who held the primitive but valuable
vacuum-tube-circuit patents had joined in.  What was lacking was money and
people and priorities.  Watson supplied them.

<p>

The SSEC was built in Endicott, under the toughest kind of forced draft, out
of standard pieces and simple circuitry.  Only IBM could have done it.  No
other outfit had stuff on the shelf - well, except the phone company, and it
was too hidebound; had no Watson, and wanted none.  By today's standards the
cost was low; not much over a million dollars.  But T.J. brooked no nonsense
from beancounters.  There was a story in the trade that when Claude Shannon
and his lovely wife were moonlighting at the Murray Hill Bell Labs, and
"borrowing" components from the stockroom to build a maze mouse, accountants
disguised as
<a name="[-6-]"><font color="red">[-6-]</font></a>
janitors were recording every peculation and taking notes for the
patent attorneys besides.

<p>

None of that in 1946/47 IBM.  The million dollars or so was off the top; the
myriad services which Hamilton drew on from all the rest of the company,
ranging from the time of Eckert and McPherson down to that of the Endicott
janitors, were never charged.  No one knows - in fact, no one ever wasted time
trying to find out - what share of IBM's total resources over say 18 months
went into the SSEC.  I'd bet it was four or five per cent, at a time when
total annual sales worldwide were well under $200 million.  Ah, Watson!

<p>

I said McPherson was approximately Wallace's boss.  There were no organization
charts in IBM, and if there were any in 1958 when I was invited back to the
much larger company - T.J. died in 1956 - I never saw them.  Tasks in the
Forties came almost entirely from Mr. Watson.  If John had needed to force
something on Wallace - and he almost certainly never did, at least for many
years - he would have had to somehow arrange that his needs reached T.J.  The
latter, if he agreed, would have given Eckert the word, and in no uncertain
terms.  The idea of formal, announced channels of authority so prevalent in
General Electric in the Fifties when I worked there, was unheard of in IBM.
Mr. Watson ran everything.

<p>

By extension, there was no budget.  Oh, there were accountants; there were
taxes due in many countries, an annual report to produce, invoices to send and
bills to pay.  And some very strange Watson charities and beneficences, we
understood.  But in general, people downstairs proposed and Mr. Watson
disposed.  You - well, not me, but Eckert for instance - you sat outside The
Old Man's office until someone shoehorned you in between the man from the
Metropolitan (Opera or Museum; he did both) and the regional manager he was
"promoting" to run the Anchorage office.  You asked briskly for what you
needed, answered amazingly pointed questions, and got your money or your
refusal, or something in between.  Very quickly!

<p>

I have often said Watson kept the money in a shoebox, and handed it out to
petitioners as he saw fit.  That's amusing, and somewhat true, but it doesn't
allow for two things: first, the box never ran empty; he had a magnificent
feel for the inflows as well as a running score on recent disbursements.
Second, there were secret forces at work, like those Shannon-watchers; he
built the French plant about that time, and there must have been many cross
checks.  He could expand Poughkeepsie off the cuff, but something more
sophisticated must have been coming over the wires from World Trade in Europe.
And he had more than sources of information; he had hidden controls.  Watson
could speed up or slow down the factories, and deliveries, and hence rental
income - there was always an eager waiting line of customers, especially at
war end.  All it took was a short call or note to George Richter, the Gray
Eminence Of Scheduling, two floors away.

<p>

Even in the Forties, IBM was something special.  Small compared to, say,
General Electric, it was already recognized for its amazing growth, its cash
flows (for years to come, the punched card machines and the early computers
would only be rented), its lovely profits, and above all, its Maximum Leader.
Watson was into everything: not just the opera and the art world, but as the
most powerful trustee of Columbia, the head of the International Chamber of
Commerce, and in a hundred power-related civic tasks and charities.  A whole
floor of World Headquarters, "590" [590 Madison Avenue], could barely hold the
secretaries and assistants that surrounded this power source.  Where an
AT&amp;T or an RCA would have had to go through carefully announced
organizational maneuvers, and much-discussed budget reallocations,
<a name="[-7-]"><font color="red">[-7-]</font></a>
to start up
a Hamilton group, T.J. did it in minutes.  And with the Endicott and World
Headquarters grapevine carrying the word about Watson's heavy support,
Hamilton in turn could cut through personnel and procurement problems almost
instantly.  And these were serious; remember, this was 1946 - even IBM was
having trouble with people and supplies.  Frank's engineers had expediters up
and down Cortlandt Street looking for surplus electronic gear, and the major
factor in choosing vacuum tube types for the buffer memory and arithmetic unit
of the SSEC was availability ("We need ten thousand right now, Sol, and they
gotta work!").

<p>

In parallel with the electronic and mechanical work - system design, we call
it now - the physical layout and handsome presentation of the huge machine had
to go ahead.  As soon as The French Bootery was known to be extrudable, plans
for a big power supply and a unique air conditioning system were set in train;
each unprecedented in central Manhattan and in IBM experience.  No replays
would be possible.

<p>

The machine took form in Endicott.  A year, in spite of the Watsonian
directive, was not enough.  But in that year, all of the electronics, the
sixteen-foot-high racks of special Lake relays, and the incredible tape units,
were designed and built and tested.  "The Soul of a New Machine" tells about a
tiny child's circus, and with thirty years of industry experience to draw on;
this was center ring in The Big Top: "Ladies and gentlemen, a feat never
before attempted on any continent!!".

<p>

On 57th Street, the heavy machinery went in.  Also there was to be a raised
floor - another world first.  Watson would not have his guests, his customers,
his stockholders tripping over snarls of cable.  The inscription on the wall
had to be written, by Wallace Eckert I think, and approved (and quite possibly
changed) by The Old Man, and engraved, and approved again.  But that, as we
all know today, is only half the story.  How about the software?

<p>

No problem about languages - there weren't any yet.  Whatever problem we chose
would be written, and debugged, and run, in machine language, and in absolute:
two four-address instructions per line of input tape.  Eckert and I talked it
over: one very short meeting.  It would be from astronomy, of course; that was
our trade.  The very first automated scientific calculations in the world had
been done by the great L.J. Comrie at Greenwich in the early Thirties, and had
drawn both of us into the game.  And if we redid them, more carefully, and
from the original math rather than from intermediate tables, as Comrie had had
to do with his rented Hollerith equipment, the output would have actual
immediate value to the national almanac offices around the world.  So - the
SSEC would calculate the positions of the Moon!

<p>

Eckert had insisted from the beginning on a strong table-lookup capability: a
design offshoot of the big tape drives, as it turned out.  Its capabilities
were set.  For the demonstration problem, each date put in would require
looking up 1870 sines and cosines, to eight-figure accuracy.  I had begun to
develop a powerful method for minimizing the size of such tables (later it
came into heavy use among operators of the first IBM mass-production, um,
minicomputer, which had only a few dozen words of storage - and the technique
disappeared completely a year or two later, overtaken by Big Memory).

<p>

<a name="[-8-]"><font color="red">[-8-]</font></a>
The method wasn't quite ready, but no matter; off I went to design the table
anyhow.  Like everything else, it had to be ready on time - or else!
Youngsters in corners at World Headquarters were feverishly writing code,
without knowing the first thing about lunar theory.  That too had to be
finished and checked out by opening day.  Eckert was the authority (I had a
substantial computing shop to run at the Watson Lab, and classes to teach -
and some of the youngsters were in them).  Somehow it got put together.

<p>

It is worth noting that the check calculation, done on a Friden desk
calculator by Eckert's assistant Becky Jones, took more than three months -
for one date! And even then, we did not have time to exactly duplicate the
table lookup and the arithmetic operations to the full precision of the
machine, which was fourteen decimal digits; other tests of the pertinent
units, and my off-line experiments on the sine/cosine table, had to suffice.
I often wondered in later years, when lunar landers were putting down on an
object whose coordinates came out of an ephemeris based on those 1947
programs, whether anyone had ever gone back and checked out the
less-significant digits!

<p>

Incidentally, among the youngsters were John Backus, the father of FORTRAN,
and Ted Codd, the father of relational databases.

<p>

The programs, and data, and my table material, were punched at the Watson Lab
on standard IBM cards.  These were converted to input tapes on a free-standing
punch called The Prancing Stallion (from its profile), which later was put in
its final position on the SSEC raised floor.  Some program testing was done
under Rex Seeber while the machine was partly assembled in Endicott, but most
of it had to be deferred until just before the ceremony.  This partially
explains why I was Cool-Hand Luke years later at GE; after that kind of
pressure, the jet engine business looked pretty peaceful!

<p>

About those tapes: the card plant in Endicott got enormous rolls of card stock
from the paper mills.  For regular card manufacturing they slit the rolls to
three-inch width (card height).  For the SSEC they furnished rolls eight
inches wide (card length).  The resulting rolls weighed 400 pounds, and had to
be hoisted onto the SSEC with a thoughtfully-provided chain fall! For the
Stallion, we pushed the rolls up a ramp.

<p>

The punch stations, slightly modified from standard IBM reproducer components,
punched two round sprocket holes at the edges, and 78(!) regular IBM
rectangular holes in between.  The sprockets drove the tape one line at a
time, and drives under separate program control fed the fresh or pre-punched
tape under ten 78-brush reading stations.  The tapes hanging down could
lengthen and shorten, and for program tapes and the table lookup unit we
cemented the tape end-to-end into short loops (yes, someone had had to provide
the jig).  There were three of these monsters at the end of the machine room.

<p>

Up to 36 of the fixed-length tape loops could be mounted on the separate
table-lookup unit, which in later years was also sometimes used for program
reading.  For the lunar calculation, I used 24 loops to make lookup time as
short as possible, and we got programming from the main tape readers.

<p>

Behind the scenes were racks and racks and racks of superfast small relays,
which were used for intermediate storage.  The tapes were slow
<a name="[-9-]"><font color="red">[-9-]</font></a>
storage, and of
course we had infinite storage on standard punched card decks, which could be
read by the SSEC directly (and punched).  The two printers behind the operator
had hidden plugboards for producing handsome output formats.

<p>

On the famous Thursday when The Old Man ordered us to remove the offending
columns, Rex and his crew had had all of these units buzzing and punching and
looping.  But the lunar program had not yet run.  I was smugly aware that the
sine/cosine table was checked out and working, so I was somewhat relaxed.  But
the strains were literally palpable.  It was to be a long weekend!

<p>

Two months before, Hamilton had committed to an opening date: Tuesday January
27, 1948.  He had done his fantastic task - designed and built the huge
system, assembled and partially tested it in Endicott, torn it down and
shipped it to Manhattan, fended off the unions who demanded that non-union IBM
let them reassemble the monster, provided the support systems, and prettied up
the joint - all in a little over 16 months.  And, to jump ahead a little, on
opening day, everything ran! Yes, the hardware, and the program, and the air
conditioning, and the people - one of the very greatest feats of nearly a
century of data crunching!

<p>

On the great day, the multitude assembled.  It was not the first major Watson
charivari I had attended, but it was a first for Rex and his senior crew.
Everyone looked very cool and confident: T.J. himself because he assumed
everything was as ordered, the rest of us because he was watching.  The
scientific contingent turned out in full force; I hosted one table at lunch,
and landed Richard Courant, whom I greatly admired and had never met.  I
unblushingly told him I had done the invitation list - well, I had proposed,
even if Wallace and John McPherson and a whole floorful of Watson aides had
disposed.  He was more interested in my stories about the punched card work we
had done for Los Alamos than in the SSEC; like most of the seniors present he
assumed that there would never be more than two or three machines like the one
being dedicated, and that only very special science would ever be allowed near
them.  Today the NYU center named after Courant mounts several hundred
thousand times as much computing power as the SSEC, and complains about the
constriction!

<p>

Mr. Watson - you couldn't call him anything else at that moment - made a
sententious little speech and posed for photographs with guests, including
Rabi of Columbia and other scientists.  One could often figure out who wrote
the draft of a Watson speech; I could hear Eckert in this one, but the overall
effect was preachier - probably from Dwayne Orton, editor of THINK.  They had
done the internal photos, the poses with Hamilton and Eckert and Seeber, the
previous Thursday; this was a day for his guests and personal friends; another
Watson triumph.  He had many every year.

<p>

Six months later my wife Dorothy and I received a telegram, delivered to our
apartment in Chelsea, although addressed to the Watson Lab at Columbia (T.J.
had special relations with Western Union, too!)  It invited us to an IBM
Family Weekend, at the Waldorf Astoria no less, to thank the men who had
worked so hard on the magnificent Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator,
<a name="[-10-]"><font color="red">[-10-]</font></a>
now at work on important scientific problems at IBM World Headquarters - and
especially to thank their wives, who had been so supportive.

<p>

Turned out that the last time The Old Man had done this (also without
warning), he had organized a private train and taken a hive of senior
executives and their wives across country to see the IBM exhibit at the San
Francisco World's Fair.  It had been a very dry trip, even with Pullman
porters fanning out at every stop looking for liquid relief.  This event had
benefited from that experience; the Waldorf had been found to list bar tabs
and such as "restaurant" on the final bill!

<p>

You can imagine the scurry for babysitters and new hats in Endicott.  Well,
come the great day Mr. and Mrs. Watson had a little luncheon for us (and a
hundred or so Headquarters executives and their wives) in the Wedgewood Room,
and told the honored if somewhat flustered ladies that the weekend was theirs.
"Go to restaurants and theaters and the opera, as IBM's guests.  Enjoy the
shops, and the spectacle of New York.  We at World Headquarters thank you for
the support you and your families gave your husbands, which in turn enabled
them to produce this spectacular machine." There were tours of the SSEC, by
the way, which many of the wives had not seen - a nice touch.

<p>

Asides: of well over two hundred ladies present at the luncheon, only two, my
wife Dorothy and Hilleth Thomas' wife Naomi, did not wear hats.  Hmmmf!
Intellectuals!  And the next night the Watson Lab couples, who after all lived
in the city, had a fancy dinner together, in the hotel.  As a matter of
convenience, sitting at one end of the table, I signed the check: about $200
(it would be ten times that today).  Six weeks later Eckert got a phone call
from a hushed-voice little beancounter at 590.  "About this, ah, rather large
restaurant charge..." Eckert told him it was quite all right; he had been in
the party.  There were accountants in IBM; they just didn't come out of hiding
very often!

<p>

Watson got his investments back many-fold: the price of the SSEC, and the
price of that Family Weekend.  The one placed him in front in the Big Science
sweepstakes, at a time when a dozen larger hi-tech companies should have
towered over him.  The other confirmed the feeling in two hundred engineering
and executive families that Mr. Watson's IBM was a wonderful place to belong
to.  It was a good time to be an emperor.

<a name="[-13-]"><font color="red">[-13-]</font></a>
There was of course no such thing in World War II as a civilian draft; at
least, not in the United States.  There was a military draft, and millions of
youngsters had been involved with it.  A fair percentage escaped from the
process.  I was one.  Yet when I talk in the next chapter about how I came to
IBM and the Watson Lab, and overnight to be in complete charge of one of the
most powerful computing installations in the world, I usually say,"I was
drafted" - that is, drafted into a civilian job.

<p>

I clung to the Navy for a while after the war started.  I was at the
U.S. Naval Observatory, just up the street from the Japanese Embassy on
Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, at Pearl Harbor time.  My wife Dorothy,
having helped me finish my doctoral dissertation, and fired with California
patriotism - a somewhat more vigorous form than the District of Columbia
variety - had drawn on her Mount Wilson connections to obtain a laboratory job
at the Bureau of Standards.  We were surrounded by the excitements of the
time.

<p>

Dorothy's work turned out three years later to have been involved with the
atomic projects, although we didn't know it then.  Her boss was a famous
spectrographer, William Meggers, who was an authority in metals analysis, and
Dorothy found herself obtaining and measuring (she was new to the former but
very experienced at the latter) spark spectrograms of the rare element
uranium.  We talked about it freely; there was no security, no hint of
anything mysterious - except that, aside from very specialized uses such as
coloring glass, and from its unusual density, uranium wasn't exactly an
everyday market item.

<p>

Both of us, as astronomers, knew of the Hahn-Meitner experiments on the
fission of uranium under laboratory conditions, and I had been an avid reader
of science fiction for over thirteen years, so we wondered idly about whether
there might be a connection.  But neither of us had been close to that kind of
physics.  I was doing the driest and most remote kind of celestial mechanics;
<a name="[-14-]"><font color="red">[-14-]</font></a>
she had been doing observational astrophysics at Mount Wilson.  We didn't have
day to day contact with the quantum mechanics people, although I had had
courses from them (Goudsmit, for one) two or three years back.

<p>

Incidentally, that kind of security, out of fashion for decades, is very
effective - no obvious security at all, that is.  What you keep secret is that
there is anything to keep secret.  If Dorothy had had to take a lie detector
test, and list all of her addresses from conception, and all her Swedish third
cousins, we would have known something important was up.  As it was, we didn't
pick at it, and tended to talk about her problems in preparing samples!

<p>

A great deal of the work at the Naval Observatory had value in the war effort.
There was the time service, obviously, and the continuing annual preparation
of the astronomical ephemeris and marine navigation almanac.  Right across the
hall from me was the first permanent rent-paying scientific IBM installation,
hard at work on the brand new Air Almanac.  But these activities tended to be
staffed by older men and women, and such younger men as were involved were
much married and bechildered.  Also, turnover in those barely-post-depression
days was low.  It didn't look as though I could offer help in those areas.  Of
course, the more purely astronomical tasks such as my own were going to
continue; the observatory had weathered earlier wars and intended to keep its
key researches alive.  An astronomical observation is like a modern airline
seat; you have to take it when available - tomorrow will be too late.

<p>

I was rather surprised, for instance, to discover that some solar observations
that were collected in my division were routinely being sent to Italy for
international compilation.  Italy was at war, so the stuff had to be routed
through Switzerland.  But science was to be served!

<p>

I had some ideas about improving the reflecting telescope on the grounds.
Because of the bright lights of the city, completely surrounding the minor
hill on which the Naval Observatory stood, not much "modern"
(i.e. astrophysical) use had been made of this strange beast.  In fact, when I
arrived it was used only a fraction of a night per week, as against every
clear night for the huge old fashioned refractor - the one with which the tiny
satellites of Mars had been discovered many decades ago.
 
As an important part of my thesis calculations, I did a prediction of where to
look near Jupiter for its eighth, extremely faint, satellite.  John Willis, my
office mate, had said there was no chance of photographing it locally.  But
when the city lights were shut down or dimmed as a wartime precaution -
Japanese submarines coming up the Potomac, no doubt - we decided to give it a
try.  And there, right in the middle of the big photographic plate, after a
ninety-minute exposure that could not have been made six months before, was my
Ph.D. insurance, J VIII, later christened Pasiphae to please the space
amateurs and the Carl Sagans.

<p>

This gave me the unpleasant experience of using the reflector, called a
Ritchey-Chr?tien type.  The problem was that you had to use very thin glass
plates, and bend them slightly to a spherical contour in special plate
holders.  Many broke in the process, and a few even broke afterwards when they
were being released for development, wasting the human and telescope time
invested.  I was fortunate; nevertheless, I had held my breath.

<p>

<a name="[-15-]"><font color="red">[-15-]</font></a>
It occurred to me to use my skills in computing higher optical aberrations,
which I had acquired (along with a fianc?e and a first taste for fancy
Chinese food) at a summer course at Harvard in 1940.  I would see if I could
design a field-flattening lens so that ordinary photographic plates and plate
holders could replace the special ones.  Willis and other senior figures were
startled at the idea.  But no special permissions were required in those days;
you just worked longer hours so as to add the new project to the assigned
ones.

<p>

While I was happily at work on the idea, I got drawn into a typical informal
just-after-Pearl-Harbor project on improving the maps of Alaska.  The Army Air
Force command involved needed to locate ground stations with geodetic
accuracy.  They wanted to use a very carefully levelled zenith camera, and
were asking us astronomers to help.

<p>

I couldn't do much better for them than a minute of arc - say a mile on the
ground.  The officers were impressed, but we agreed it wouldn't be good
enough.  I suggested that if they took two exposures on each film, with the
camera turned about the vertical axis in between, much less accurate
measurements would show where the center of the field was.  They looked
unhappy, presumably because of the time needed to modify the cameras yet
again, and went away.

<p>

I had had fun.  I had been caught up in the Real War for a few weeks.  The fly
boys had come to me because of my optical knowledge.  Could I use it
elsewhere?  Not at the observatory, probably.  I cast about.  In retrospect, I
should have looked farther afield, and certainly taken more time.  My opposite
number at Harvard, a strange plump creature named Leland Cunningham, ended up
running an IBM shop at Aberdeen Proving Ground and writing the sample-problem
specs for ENIAC.  But it took him a year or so to get the job, and I wanted to
do something right away - a trait that will surface many times in these
stories!

<p>

Also Dorothy was doing very well indeed in her new job at the Bureau of
Standards, and having uprooted her only the year before from lovely Pasadena,
I wanted to stay in Washington if I could.  Simple inquiries revealed that the
Navy had need of optical experts in the Bureau of Ordnance.  Presto!  I was a
P-2 Assistant Physicist in BuOrd Re4, Fire Control Research and Development.
And at a pleasant salary increase besides: $2600 a year.

<p>

Doesn't sound like much today, but on the strength of such wealth Dorothy and
I bought our first house.  It was brand new, located in Kensington, Maryland,
on an unpaved street - and cost $8500.  It is probably still there (they paved
the street after the war), and I'll bet it now goes for ten times our price.

<p>

Most of BuOrd was housed in horrid temporary structures left over from World
War I, and I was put to work in a gigantic drafting room at the very back of
the buildings.  My routine, six days a week of course, was ten minutes walk to
the Kensington Jitney, twenty minutes ride to Chevy Chase Circle, thirty
minutes more downtown.  Plus connecting waits, plus the Ordnance Amble from
the front door and the guards to the sign-up sheet; call it an hour and a
half.  Dorothy was in a five-way car pool; gasoline rationing had begun.

<p>

I worked for a civilian named Mike Goldberg, an expert on mechanical linkages,
a curious component of the analog gun directors that are now one
<a name="[-16-]"><font color="red">[-16-]</font></a>
with the
dinosaur and the dodo.  He passed on assignments from the young Re4e officers,
who worked in somewhat more pleasant quarters down the hall.  Their boss was a
two-striper named Stanley Ballard, who had been an insignificant physics
professor in Hawaii when the war started.  He fit the job well, and afterwards
used his connections to rise quite high in the American Institute of Physics.

<p>

Another physics type was Urner Liddell, who was seconded much later to work on
the postwar nuclear tests in the Pacific.  And there were several others, all
quite serious about their uniforms but none very knowledgeable about
old-fashioned lens-and-mirror optics, which was a backwater of 1942 physics in
the same way that my orbit computing specialty had been a backwater of 1936
astronomy.  So I was welcome, although on my side I knew too much about the
subject rather than too little.  That is, I knew about higher aberrations of
fancy astronomical telescopes and Schmidt cameras, and not much about
gunsights!

<p>

Anyhow, Goldberg sat me down next to a career civil servant, an engineer from
the Naval Gun Factory named Russell Banker, who knew plenty about gunsights
but very little about theory.  We made a good team, and in only a few days I
knew about parallax and exit pupils and such.  Also, Re4f (next door to Re4e)
turned out to be the boys who did radar, so secret still that the name was not
used in public, and through them I first heard of the gigantic buildup at MIT,
which was for disguise called the "Radiation Laboratory".  So there were lots
of new work tools on the one hand, and war vistas far beyond those at the
Naval Observatory, on the other.

<p>

About the difference between gunsight optics and fancy aberration theory: when
I came up for my thesis defense in Ann Arbor, a few weeks after moving to
BuOrd, I tried to explain to the physics prof on my committee what I was
doing.  He was, by coincidence, the optics man at Michigan, and was so put off
by my plebeian use of his elegant science that he sat on the suggestion I get
a cum laude for recovering J VIII.  Sigh!

<p>

I had a nice Friden calculator - such gadgets were already under wartime
allocation - and was put to work on donated British and captured Japanese
gunsights.  The latter were tested and disassembled at the Gun Factory, the
lens parameters measured, and the dope sent over to Re4e for analysis and
comment.  I was startled to be told that, while Japanese optics were
supposedly copied from the Germans, the Navy patent files showed nothing
similar from Zeiss or thereabouts.  This was the first indication I personally
had had that Japanese technology was not just duplication and adaptation.  It
was confirmed several times for me during the war; first hand in optical
engineering, anecdotally in nearby fields like fire control and radio.  So I
was not as surprised as the media and the public when the Japanese cameras and
consumer electronics came on strong two decades later.

<p>

The load increased.  Somebody produced an assistant for me, a young New Yorker
who yearned audibly for the fleshpots of the Grand Concourse but found working
in BuOrd preferable to boot camp.  Indeed, after I left Washington things got
tighter in the Bronx draft boards, and they took him away.  His output was
low, and supervising him took more time than he saved me - another lesson to
store away for Watson Lab futures.  But there was
<a name="[-17-]"><font color="red">[-17-]</font></a>
indeed some small pleasure
in command, or at least I found it an interesting departure from being
commanded.

<p>

The pressures of a Real War were fascinating.  Major projects, considerable
excursions from old ways of doing things, could be set up in days.  I was
accustomed as a budding scientist to "keeping up with the literature", so the
flood of reports and recommendations and proposals didn't faze me the way it
did the older civil servants like Banker and the drafting room types.  I began
to realize that having young physicists in the Re4 offices was working better
than their lack of practical experience might have promised.

<p>

For instance, there was a horrendous shortage of fancy rangefinders, and of
experienced operators on shipboard.  Some years back a decision had been made
to adopt stereo rangefinders rather than split-field.  In a peacetime service
the Navy could take the time to select and train sailors with keen depth
perception.  Now they needed ten times as many, instanter.  Re4e beat the
bushes for psychologists, and also for firms to design and build training
gadgets.  The bright people under Ned Land at Polaroid were among those who
surfaced.

<p>

I wasn't directly involved, but had lots of ideas and advice to offer anyhow -
much of it unwelcome, because there was so little time to argue.  Decide!
Act!  Try something else; we just lost another carrier!  In my drafting room
men were worrying about the torpedoes that unexpectedly failed to work.  Was
it the fire control equipment they had designed, or manufacturing problems, or
poor training, or something unforeseen?  There were horror stories from the
European theaters too.  I still remember one about the escape hatches on one
type of bomber being just a little too small for a gunner with his parachute
to squeeze through.  Solution: select very small gunners!

<p>

There was a weird project to increase the accuracy of those stereo
rangefinders by filling them with helium instead of dry nitrogen, and that
involved a Princeton professor named Merrill Flood who surfaced thirty years
later in Management Information Systems - another helium-filled instrument!
The NDRC, National Defence Research Committee, under the aegis of Vannevar
Bush, produced such projects, and academics to staff them, in an amazing
torrent of novelty.  But I learned little about radar, and heard nothing about
atomic weapons.

<p>

With all this excitement and hard work, there were still strange interludes.
The battleship Alabama was commissioned and before going off to first station,
anchored in Chesapeake Bay for a week or so.  Annapolis got a day, and us Navy
civilians got a day; we were bussed over, put aboard via glamorous launches,
and allowed to clamber all over the huge ship.  My gang looked at fire control
gear: gun turrets, gun directors, rangefinders, radar equipment.  Others
looked at propulsion, or ammunition hoists, or whatever.  Great idea; it
charged us all up for weeks; we even quit complaining about the (lack of) air
conditioning!

<p>

Another: one day a very academic type from the University of Chicago showed up
at BuOrd and walked off with a best-design submarine periscope.  Since
periscopes were even scarcer right then than submarines, we were all
flabbergasted.  Of course, three years later I realized he had been outfitting
<a name="[-18-]"><font color="red">[-18-]</font></a>
the Stagg Field pile, for Fermi and Co.!  It was the second clue Dorothy and I
had had about the bomb, and we missed it as we missed the first.

<p>

Antiaircraft guns were increasingly important in the Pacific, although
kamikaze attacks were still rare.  These cannon were then directed by
gunsights attached to the guns.  There were few skilled gunners; the old open
sights that we still see in World War II movies didn't let novices knock down
many attackers.  So, technology - in fact, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology - came to the rescue.  Doc Draper, whose big postwar enterprise was
to draw student and flowerpower protest in Cambridge in the Sixties, was
designing an analog computer, later to be called the Mark 14 Gunsight, to
replace the low-tech ring sights. The latter cost maybe $50; the Mark 14s,
even in huge quantity, cost nearly $10,000 - but the warships the kamikazes
were damaging cost a lot more!

<p>

I came in contact with that effort in a roundabout way.  The 20mm cannon
involved had to be boresighted on shipboard.  That is, you had to make sure
the cannon and the gunsight were lined up.  The sight was no problem, but when
a gunner looked through the bore of this skinny little gun his field of view
was so tiny he often wasted much time finding the boresighting target.  I had
the idea of putting a plug with a negative lens in it, in the gun muzzle, and
another, with a positive lens, and a mirror to make things convenient, in the
breech.  A reverse telephoto or reverse opera glass, in effect; what it did
was increase the field of view fourfold.  The demagnification of the target
didn't matter; if anybody cared, a bigger one could be used.  Well, much to my
pleasure, a small company was found to make the little kit, and in some
quantity.  I still have the drawings, but nobody ever sent me a sample.  Ah,
wartime!

<p>

This sounds like a lifetime.  Actually, I had come down to BuOrd from the
Observatory in May [1942], had gotten my Ph.D. in June, and all the
excitements I've been reciting had taken about six months.  Some of it was the
war, some of it was biological; the clock runs differently when you are 24 -
and the gonads too, for sure!  I did some travelling; notably, flew up to the
rangefinder production operation at Keuffel &amp; Esser in Hoboken, in a
two-seater Navy trainer with a nice Re5 flyboy who did barrel rolls until I
informed him grimly that I was about to throw up all over his airplane!  I
joined the OSA, Optical Society of America, and because I had lots of surplus
energy - and it didn't hurt any that I was sponsored by Dorothy's boss
Meggers, an OSA bigwig - began rising in that hitherto-conservative outfit.

<p>

Also at the Bureau of Standards Dorothy had encountered an unusual outdoor
group.  They called themselves spelunkers (cavers, in Britain).  They
specialized in exploring Schoolhouse Cave in nearby West Virginia, longer
drives being impossible under gas rationing.  We were not much into caves -
darkness, and narrow places, and a lot of mud - but two dozen of the bunch
were foldboaters.  They had learned about the sport on pre-Hitler European
travels, brought the folding rubber-skinned kayaks back with them and stored
them in their Washington closets, and went out on the upper Potomac and such,
when the water was white and the weather not too grim.  I'll have more to tell
about the sport, which was the first of many high-thrill adventures I have
enjoyed after emerging from my soft
<a name="[-19-]"><font color="red">[-19-]</font></a>
childhood; anyhow, Dorothy and I bought
one of the last prewar foldboats available, and tried to learn by doing.

<p>

There wasn't much other social life, especially for newcomers.  The Naval
Observatory crew was pretty inbred, and the BuOrd civilians were the same.
Ballard and his young officers were learning to be Navy - Navy Reserve, we
said cuttingly - and had special privileges we mortals lacked.  The Meggers
family had a big house out toward the Bureau, which was then on Connecticut
Avenue, and invited us several times.  They ran to collections of many kinds,
and indeed in postwar the oldest daughter became a well-known anthropologist,
which is sort of people-collecting.  We liked them and admired Meggers himself
very much; he was a cross between a senior scientist and a Will Rogers, and
had a comic feud going with George Harrison of MIT, the world-famous designer
of ruling engines (on which the diffraction gratings for Dorothy's
spectroscopes were made).  Dorothy's part of NBS, in fact, looked very much
like the Harvard astronomy milieu out of which I had plucked my optical theory
and my marriage.

<p>

We were isolated, besides.  I had been a part of the Ann Arbor scene, and
Dorothy, of the Cal Tech/Mount Wilson scene, for six years.  Washington was
very different, and especially in wartime.  We had a house, and problems with
furniture, and not much money, and our personal relationships to work out.  So
what time was left over from pretty heavy work commitments got used up fast.
Neither of us were family-dependent; still, it didn't help any that mine were
in Michigan and Dorothy's in California.

<p>

I was restless.  I had enjoyed the little burst of creativity while I was
doing the boresight design.  And I was more than a little jealous of Navy
officer privilege; you didn't actually have to bow when a four-striper swept
down the hall, but you felt that nobody would be surprised if you did!  The
wartime selection process put some great guys in the Pacific (or so the papers
told us, between accounts of the many U.S. disasters) but the ones left behind
on Constipation Avenue, as we frequently called it, didn't turn me on.

<p>

Seemed like I ought to be able to help more, and be more creative, and still
not rile my Michigan draft board.  Dorothy was willing, if not eager.  We had
decided not to try pregnancy, let alone parenthood, for a while yet, so we
were portable.  I cast about, and almost immediately tripped over the Mark 14,
which was being boresighted with my gadget.  The Draper Gunsight, as it was
still called, was going into mass production at Sperry Gyroscope up on Long
Island; meanwhile, would I consider a position at their Garden City
laboratories as a fire control scientist?  I certainly would!

<p>

The house was simple: we told the real estate agency we were leaving, they
kept the payments we had made so far, the papers got torn up, and somebody
moved in as we left - same day, in fact.  Washington!  We called a mover and
our very minor possessions were collected at Sperry expense, and reappeared a
few days later (after all, it was wartime, and a very small part load besides)
in Garden City.

<p>

We had found another house, in nearby Hempstead, after about two days.  We
knew no more would be built; the remaining potato fields would survive until
we left in 1948, as it turned out.  In fact, our little place had been too
late for a gas hot water heater; there was a gas stove, but hot water came via
pea
<a name="[-20-]"><font color="red">[-20-]</font></a>
coal and a peculiar pot stove in the basement, which went out several
times a week.  Our cat Suzy had her many litters in the big crate we kept the
special coal in, next to the regular coal bin beside the hot-air furnace.  The
house cost $11,000 but the down payment, although not as minuscule as in
Kensington, was only $1500.  And we had a garage; useful on Long Island, where
clearly there weren't going to be any new cars for a while, or even new tires.
Our neighbors were not war types; on one side, a barber; on the other, a
lead-burner (he said "boiner") who did things like chemical sinks, and
industrial plumbing in general.

<p>

Dorothy answered ads for a while, and found a job in Manhattan as an
industrial spectroscopist at the labs of the Interchemical Corporation, which
until the war had been mostly making printing inks and special paints.  In
fact, they were about to get a contract for a surprising black paint for the
Black Widow night fighter.  The surprise was that it was not dull, dull black
but high-gloss; turned out one of those NDRC professors had shown that the
returns when a searchlight found such a plane were less for specular
reflection!

<p>

She had general work to do, metals and pigments and such, but also was trying
to apply spark technology to organic materials like amino acids.  Hasn't
survived; things like infrared spectroscopy and chromatography are easier and
more general.  But she had some fun, and felt useful.  Main trouble was that
she had to commute on the notorious Long Island Railroad, plus a short hop on
the Eighth Avenue subway, which wreaked havoc in our sex life.  And six days a
week!

<p>

Meanwhile, between attempts to keep the pot stove in our basement going, I was
entering a new world of optical complexity.  Of course the K&amp;E Navy
rangefinders were fantastic, but those designs had been frozen before Pearl
Harbor.  My Sperry project was in the design stage, or at least in design
revision after prototyping.  It was a double-ended aircraft periscope, to
stick out of the top and bottom of the secret new B-29 bomber, mid-fuselage.
There were small plastic domes through which the optics looked at attacking
aircraft.  When the gunner tracked a plane across the zero-elevation
"equator", a prism flipped the eyepiece field from the upper to the lower
periscope or vice versa.  The junction case also contained an analog computer
featuring three-dimensional cams, rate gyros, and a hundred pounds of
ancillary gear.  Outputs from the system were to control remote machine gun
turrets on the top and bottom of the plane, and at the tail.  One human
advantage was that there would be no poor devil as tail gunner.  The system
had a major competitor from General Electric, which won out in the end, but
that was some years in the future - in fact, so was the B-29, which was still
under design and test at Boeing Seattle.  And it too had competitors in 1943.

<p>

The periscope and all its complex optics had been designed, and would be
built, by the Hawkeye Works of Eastman Kodak, in Rochester.  Sperry Gyroscope
furnished the central box and the entire gun turret complex, with much
hydraulics from Vickers, another division of Sperry Corporation.  My major job
was to keep track of Kodak progress, check proposed design improvements,
approve the optical tests at Hawkeye, and generally represent the Garden City
crew in a completely novel arena.  They knew fire control,
<a name="[-21-]"><font color="red">[-21-]</font></a>
radar (the Varian brothers were big guns on the staff), and hydraulics.  As
far as lenses and prisms were concerned, well, they knew they were made of
glass.  Usually!

<p>

It was fascinating.  There were all kinds of new ideas.  The plastic domes on
the ends of the periscopes introduced a systematic error in elevation; should
we put a mechanical correction cam in the computer or make the inner and outer
surfaces of the domes non-concentric?  Would new eyepiece designs (like the
ones in today's most expensive binoculars, and actually a copy of a Zeiss
patent) really improve gunner performance - wider field, yes, but more
distortion?

<p>

Main thing for me, though, was meeting an individual.  As I began to make
frequent trips up to Kodak, usually by overcrowded train, I had more and more
to do with a real lens design expert, the head of the Hawkeye group.  He was
an Englishman, Rudolf Kingslake, world famous in his very special field, and
also the son-in-law of a chap named Conrady, the author of the treatise on
lens design from which I was studying the art.  There was supposed to be a
second, unpublished volume of this opus, with much reference to photographic
lenses, and Rudie, as his bevy of female computers called him, had the only
copy.  Great story, and it may even have been true; more likely, Kingslake
knew enough to have written the volume himself!

<p>

He had a chap (Harold Bennett) working for him as a senior lens designer, who
wanted to mechanize ray tracing calculations, which Kodak did with Fridens and
Marchants, having stepped up from five-place logarithms in the Thirties.  You
could tell an optical computer by the fact that his or her trig tables were
much dirtier - that is, much more frequently used - at the front (small
angles), while astronomy or physics computers used all angles impartially!
Today a programmable hand-held calculator would be much, much better, but such
computations are now deeply imbedded in fancy overall design packages (expert
systems) and no longer are performed out where designers can see them.

<p>

Having watched the punched card operations at the Naval Observatory, and
having heard about all the fancy electronics in the MIT and Sperry radar
equipments, I was quite sure attaching funny little servos to the keyboard and
twiddlers of a Friden was not the way to go.  But my obvious admiration for
Kodak (and Kingslake) design skills, and my activities in the Optical Society,
made up for my criticisms.

<p>

Some years later the prototype machine was demonstrated.  It was so far behind
what could be done with truly automatic equipment, and so far out of step with
the promises of ENIAC and radar electronics, that it died.  Compared to the
room-sized machines of the late Forties, you could call it an early
"micro"computer!

<p>

About this time the Mark 14 began to come off the assembly lines, and I was
asked to move to the new Lake Success plant on Long Island (where the nascent
UN activities lived later, while the Manhattan headquarters was being built).
The work was entirely different, and I would have preferred to stay with the
Garden City/Rochester project.  But the war in the Pacific was central to
everything, and the kamikazes were increasingly dangerous.  The
<a name="[-22-]"><font color="red">[-22-]</font></a>
Mark 14 was
needed, and in vast quantities - one to every 20mm cannon, if possible.

<p>

The optics were exceedingly primitive.  The gunner looked through the box,
which was mounted right on the gun.  He tracked the target plane through two
very thin unsilvered glass plates, off which an image of bright crosshairs was
reflected.  The plates were wiggled by the innards of the gunsight - rate
gyros working against springs, whose tensions were set by a range knob on the
front of the sight.  So they had to be light.

<p>

Sperry needed sources for tens of thousands of sets of these optics, and then
to inspect them for adequacy and assemble them into the sights, and test the
whole box on special calibration rigs.  The set was two thick windows, two
thin reflecting plates, a collimating lens (no problem), a special light bulb
(ditto), and a reticle with a very fine transparent pattern on an opaque
background.  Parenthetically, the company we found which could etch the
reticle pattern through a thin metal substrate is today active in chip
fabrication - Buckbee Mears, it was called then.

<p>

My boss was a George Bentley, who had gotten a doctorate from Draper at MIT
and then become director of research for Hamilton Watch.  He teamed me with a
buyer named Jack Varick, and sent us out to hunt glass and reticles.  The thin
plates were going to be difficult: optical glass, bubble and stria free, quite
accurately dimensioned, and with the reflecting surfaces very flat and very
parallel.  Kodak could make them on their camera-lens line for a thousand
bucks a pair, and I wasn't convinced mass quantities were possible.  The shop
tested them for flatness before uncementing them from the tool, and most of
the plates sprang unflat after separation.  Post-separation testing was tricky
- expert hand work - and I was going to have to set up methods back at Sperry
for girls to use, so I was very worried.

<p>

Jack remembered that quartz crystal plates, which he bought for the radar
boys, had to be pretty fancy too, and to extremely close thickness tolerances
besides.  He found a company that could make what I needed in unlimited
quantities, and for less than $50 a pair.  It took more than scientists to win
a war!

<p>

Buyers and travelling salesmen had other capabilities.  Jack was an expert at
finding the "action" - good wartime restaurants in Rochester, bars with stocks
of Scotch in Chicago.  He wasn't as interested as I in women, but was
considerably more expert at dealing with them (I was a great judge of
striptease - a much more passive skill).  He learned a little about optical
parts from me; I learned a lot about life on the road from him.

<p>

Back at the ranch I had to set up inspection methods.  Sperry had used almost
no optics; the regulars could handle the reticles and the light bulbs, but I
had to do the rest.  My astronomical antecedents got me into Perkin Elmer,
which was so loaded down with high-priority work even Jack Varick and Sperry
were not welcome.  They were using a simple, sturdy interferometer for several
inspection tasks, and I persuaded them to make me a couple.  These became the
heart of the Lake Success department.  Wages were frozen, but I got a small
raise anyhow.

<p>

One of the small pleasures of life was to walk down the long rows of girls and
women on the assembly floor, and have them whistle at you.  Men were
<a name="[-23-]"><font color="red">[-23-]</font></a>
very
scarce; even my pre-IBM goatee was acceptable.  Dorothy was warily amused.

<p>

Bentley And Co. were now engaged in a much more ambitious project - to
redesign and build the next Draper gunsight.  This was to control quad-mounted
40mm cannon and even larger guns, would be free-standing, and needed to reach
out much further for its targets.  It therefore was to have a 5-power
telescope, with lots of difficult optical goodies that are of little interest
against today's Star Wars electronics.

<p>

I was asked to design - yes, design, not just approve, or inspect - an
auxiliary optical system to superimpose a radar image from a tiny internal
CRT, on the gunner's field of view.  Trouble was, the box was full!  I learned
to greatly respect the skills of the senior designer/draftsmen, who moved
things around for me.  This came in handy later, in IBM and GE, when most of
my confreres were carried away with exotic electronics.  I still marvel today
at the innards of the magnificent laser printers, knowing how demanding the
mechanical parts of the system are, and therefore understanding that such
machinery will remain expensive even with one-dollar chips, and will always
require skilled maintenance.

<p>

There were procurement problems with this gunsight also (it was really a
minidirector), notably to find a zero-thickness beamsplitter flat to less than
a wavelength of light.  Jack and I did it, but it wasn't as much fun the
second time around.  I didn't look forward to new inspection technology.

<p>

So in the fall of 1944 I began looking for a real design job.  I knew I was
not in the Kingslake class, but how would I ever get to that eminence beating
the Utica bushes with Jack Varick?  What I needed was a job at Perkin Elmer or
Keuffel &amp; Esser or Polaroid, if not at Bausch and Lomb or Kodak.  And I
found the Farrand Optical Company, in the very far Bronx.

<p>

Clare Farrand held valuable patents on the dynamic loudspeaker, and had
answered the call of WW II by establishing a remarkable optical house, mostly
with his own money, to tackle the toughest level of the technology.  For
instance, Farrand was building a very complex large rangefinder.  That was the
province of Bausch and Lomb in Rochester and K &amp; E in Hoboken - and Zeiss
in Jena, of course.  Kodak's Hawkeye works had tried to build a similar
instrument, and it was giving them fits.  Farrand had mastered that, and was
looking for more difficult projects.  They had a designer named Seymour Rosin,
and needed another.  It looked promising.

No one else at Farrand lived on Long Island, let alone near Hempstead.  And
moving in wartime was almost impossible.  So a major task when I accepted the
job there was to convince my local rationing board that I had to drive over
twenty miles a day each way, six days a week.  It was actually harder than
persuading my draft board, which by now was used to having my various
employers claim that the entire war effort revolved around my fantastic
scientific capabilities.  But with a little help from my new personnel
department both projects succeeded.

<p>

My poor little 1937 Plymouth soon edged past the 100,000 mark, but actually
benefited from its new duties, since it was soon allowed a new set of tires
and a better battery.  Meanwhile, diligent Dorothy continued to suffer on the
Lonn Guyland, as the veteran commuters called it.  Even she got some pleasure
from my gas coupons, however, since occasional little trips which we could not
have done on an A-ration book (into Manhattan and back for a concert, for
instance) became possible with a C sticker.  And to my amazement, Farrand made
me an allowance for gasoline and bridge tolls.

<p>

Sy Rosin and I reported to a man named Bob Tripp, who had been chief engineer
for Disney, and was a fountain of weird ideas.  Sy was conservative and I was
still rather astronomical, so Tripp was a bridge to wilder shores.  I have to
get back to stories about the computer, but a short sample of the games we
played may be fun, if only to show how differently we had to approach problems
like flight simulation before we had computer graphics and heroic software.

<p>

Tripp had agreed to explore building a Flight Briefing Trainer, to simulate
invasion approaches to the Pacific islands and the Japanese coastlines.  He
planned a large room with an absolutely flat terrazzo floor (in my cynical way
<a name="[-26-]"><font color="red">[-26-]</font></a>
I claimed that this would be the hardest part of the whole project, and I was
right).  A powered cart with analog computing gear would run around on this
floor with the same freedoms as a dodge-em car at a carnival, and would carry
a simulated cockpit and controls, and the trainee.  He would be looking into
the eyepieces of a periscope, which stuck up through the roof of the cart and
could be raised or lowered by the cockpit controls.  On the ceiling was a
gorgeous relief map of the target area, and the head of the periscope could
come "down" close to the terrain.  What a monstrosity!

<p>

I was charged with designing the head prism and top end of the optics, which
had to replace the upper part of a specified Navy periscope.  Tripp had
already solved the problem of depth of focus, which is serious in all such
model devices, by planning to synchronize rapidly changing focal length of my
top lens with selective illumination of the map, on a 30-cycle-a-second basis.
Good grief - dodge-em cars and science fiction lighting!

<p>

Most of it was built, I heard later, but fortunately the war ended before full
operation was needed.  I'd love to have seen it, and ridden it.

<p>

There was a great Christmas party [1944], where us upstairs types got a
long-awaited chance to, ah, mingle with the all-female assembly and test crew
from the rangefinder area.  Dorothy had been hoarding red stamps to buy a
Christmas Eve roast, which was ruined long before I staggered in from my long
drive and other exhausting efforts, and collapsed on the sofa.  It was a very
cold Christmas, it was.  A once-a-year fall from grace might have been
forgiven, but coupled with other adventures which I had not concealed very
well, and with those wasted ration points...

<p>

I finished the initial periscope head design and began on the eye end.  The
idea was to split the light into two eyepieces to simulate infinite-distance
binocular vision, and also to feed in a view of the instrument panel.  Then
Tripp said one day that he and Mr. Farrand wanted to build optics for
projection television after the war, and would I put a few hours a month on a
library and patent search, since I knew about Schmidt and similar high
aperture systems, and since the shop downstairs was making deep-dish mirrors
on a secret contract?  I quickly decided that to check out even a few patents
would require hundreds of hours of ray-tracing - even with a machine like the
one planned at Kodak!

<p>

Unlike an initial design, where you trace a ray or two and then change
something, and trace a few more, in the assessment of finished designs you
could select an assortment of rays in advance and trace them all through the
first surface of the lens, or even through the first surface of each of
several lenses under investigation.  Then you could repeat through the second
surface or surfaces, and then the third, and so on.  I was of course reminded
of Wallace Eckert's punched card shop at the Naval Observatory, and of
Comrie's work at Greenwich, where calculations for many dates were carried
ahead one step at a time.

<p>

Today we would immediately think of parallel computing, one of the major
current big-machine enthusiasms.  In a machine with say 1024 processors we
could trace a hundred rays through each of ten lens designs (at a millisecond
a surface),and finish all ten analyses in less than a second.  In 1945 you
could only have one "processor", and it would be a whole room full of
<a name="[-27-]"><font color="red">[-27-]</font></a>
electromechanical punched card machines, and with two or three operators.  Ten
complex lenses might well take a week to run - but by hand it would take
months.

<p>

One very nice thing about working at Farrand was that you were encouraged to
keep up with the literature.  And not just by subscribing to it yourself; the
company took all the useful journals, and suggestions for additions to the
list were welcome.  These were circulated briskly, and Rosin and I were right
behind Mr. Farrand and Bob Tripp in priority.  In early April a very short
article appeared in SCIENCE to the effect that the International Business
Machines Corporation had appointed Dr. Wallace J. Eckert, former director of
the Nautical Almanac Office at the Naval Observatory, as head of a new
Department of Pure Science, and that he would be establishing a Watson
Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University.

<p>

The note said that the laboratory would have a full complement of IBM gear,
which would be used for instruction and research.  It mentioned Eckert's
former connection with Columbia as chairman of the astronomy department, and
somewhat <i>sotto voce</i> that the chief executive of IBM was a prominent
trustee of the university.  I saw the piece at the beginning of May, and
immediately wrote Eckert a letter explaining my idea about mechanizing
large-scale optical calculations.  I suggested he might let me come over at
night when things got rolling, and experiment a little.  And to sugar-coat
things I mentioned that my employer, "Farrand Optical in the Bronx", would
have commercial use for such an application after the war.

<p>

Ten days later a little man showed up in Farrand's office.  He introduced
himself as representing a Manhattan Engineer District, a secret agency of the
Army with offices in the Empire State Building.  I never knew exactly how he
approached it, but somehow he explained to Farrand, who of course had very
high level personal security clearances, that something much more important
than optical design was going on out in New Mexico.  He produced my letter to
Eckert, which Farrand had never seen, and said he wanted me for this operation
at Columbia.  Coooo!

<p>

They had me in.  I was dumbfounded.  I protested that I had not talked to
Eckert, that I had had no idea of going to work for this new laboratory, that
I liked it where I was.  "No matter," said the little man.  "Report to this
Mr. Eckert tomorrow, and he will arrange everything.  His office is at 590
Madison Avenue."  I protested that no such impressment was possible - I
remember using the term "shanghai" - and that my Michigan draft board would
have to be consulted.  But down inside, a great feeling of excitement was
growing.  I was going to get my hands on punched card machines at last, and do
some massive computing.

<p>

The next days were a blur.  I went in to Manhattan with Dorothy on the train
the next day, and discovered that 590 Madison was the headquarters building of
IBM.  In later years I invented the name "Galactic Headquarters", but the
Watsonites then called it merely "World Headquarters", capitalizing on the IBM
phrase "World Peace Through World Trade" which T.J. had adopted in the
Thirties.  In typical IBM fashion, I was expected (although the reception desk
was somewhat disconcerted by my beard and sport jacket).  Eckert was indeed
upstairs, and was delighted to see me.

<p>

Within a few minutes I knew that there was to be an atomic bomb.  It was
<a name="[-28-]"><font color="red">[-28-]</font></a>
mid-May, two months before the Alamagordo burst, but Eckert had not been
cleared for such information.  What he knew, and passed on to me, was that a
secret laboratory had been established "near Santa Fe", that very senior
scientists like his old friend I. I. Rabi of the Columbia physics department,
and the famous John von Neumann, were prime movers, and that the group was
harnessing the fission of uranium to make a fantastic weapon.

<p>

This laboratory, which I was to hear called Los Alamos a few days later, was
officially just a post office box in Santa Fe (which among other curious mail
got several hundred copies each month of ASTOUNDING STORIES!).  Eckert told me
that there was a major punched card installation there, with something like
four IBM 601 multiplying punches, all of which could allow for algebraic signs
and two of which could actually do division.  There were supporting machines:
tabulators and sorters and reproducers and such.  The shop was run by Stan
Frankel and Nick Metropolis (and, I found out many years later, Doc Nelson),
who supervised a mixed bunch of young civilians and dragooned enlisted men; it
was working around the clock and still falling behind, and there was neither
floor space nor personnel to expand the operation.

<p>

"They came to IBM for help," Eckert said.  "Mr. Watson and John McPherson
(whom I was about to meet) thought immediately of the Astronomical Bureau at
Columbia, but it is heavily engaged in fairly high priority work for another
part of the Army, and really has no room for physical expansion anyhow.  It
has only two 601s and an old 285 fixed-plugboard tabulator, and there is
hardly room to move."

<p>

What I had not thought of when I read the story in SCIENCE was that IBM itself
had to have wartime priorities - and very high ones at that - to retain any of
the machines that were coming down its overstressed production lines.  Even
the cards were under strict allocation.  If T.J. wanted to help the war
effort, and at the same time position his company for postwar scientific
initiatives, here was the perfect opportunity.  He had his all-seeing eye on
Eckert, on the Naval Observatory shop, on Columbia of course.  He was still
outraged at Harvard.  So he decided that there should be a new venture on
Morningside Heights, told McPherson, who was then director of engineering at
590 Madison, to see to it, and turned to his next imperial task.

<p>

Eckert was offered a chance to go back to his beloved Columbia in a very
prestigious role, a chance to direct a far more powerful computing facility
than he had ever had before, a chance to build a better machine than Aiken's -
and, as I found out sixteen years later, at two and a half times the rather
good salary he was getting from Uncle Sam!

<p>

He had set up the little astronomy shop a decade ago with his own hands, but
it had been run for the last five or six years by a vigorous woman he had
selected and trained, named Lillian Hausman.  The newer enterprise in
Washington had been run for him by Jack Belzer, about whom more in later
stories.  Eckert needed another subordinate, and was therefore delighted to
get my letter.  I was well known to him, a fellow astronomer of the same
celestial mechanics persuasion, a Ph.D. acceptable to his snooty Columbia
buddies, an expert computer and numerical analyst - scarce as hen's teeth,
especially in wartime - and I lived right next door!  And also I came cheap,
although it was
<a name="[-29-]"><font color="red">[-29-]</font></a>
a year or two before I sadly recognized the fact.  But I
couldn't have said no, with that little man telling Farrand where to send me,
could I?

<p>

Eckert and McPherson had worked out a list of machines, and the Columbia
administration had found space on the tenth floor of Pupin, the physics
building which contained the astronomy department and the Thomas J. Watson
Astronomical Computing Bureau.  There was even an old teaching telescope up
topside, for undergraduate use on the three clear Manhattan nights a year!
The Los Alamos priorities began to function; crates of IBM equipment, chairs
and tables and file cabinets (and a very big safe), cartons of punched cards
and tabulator paper, all appeared as if by magic.  What fancy priorities
couldn't provide, IBM money and prestige - and Wallace's old Columbia
connections - always could.

<p>

All I had to do was put it together.  McPherson said he would send some
bodies.  I went upstairs and borrowed operating manuals from Lillian and her
people, and asked naive questions about plugboards (Wallace had not ordered
nearly enough).  We all knelt down prayerfully in front of the hoary old 285
for my first wiring lessons - wasted, because it turned out we were getting a
much fancier machine if the Pupin elevator was up to it.  You have to
understand that I had never even run a sorter!

<p>

Also I had summer flu, and Dorothy's parents arrived from California for a
long visit.  And the cat was pregnant again, but not urgently.

<p>

The intellectual excitement was enormous.  In two weeks we had visits from
Johnnie von Neumann, Hans Bethe, Roy Marshak, Maria and Joe Mayer, and - like
a torrent from a firehose - one Richard Feynman.  Three of them were to be
Nobelists, and Johnnie was supposed to be the world's greatest applied
mathematician (I was a Chandrasekhar rooter myself).  The punched card boys
were too busy to come, but Feynman seemed to know all about the machines (and
everything else besides).  For instance, he showed me how to wire a chain of
selectors on my new 405 tabulator, a technique which in those days was too
esoteric to be in an operating manual.  He showed me once, and pretty briskly;
you didn't get a second shot with Feynman!  Lillian didn't know such tricks,
Eckert didn't know, McPherson knew (he had edited "IBM Pointers" for a couple
of years) but was far out of my reach.  So I had to learn from a future Nobel
prizewinner!

<p>

World Headquarters had me fill out a form or two, and took over the struggle
with my draft board.  I still have my original ID card, almost certainly the
first one ever issued at 590 with a beard on it.  There was no physical; a
year or so later the personnel department ginned one up, and told me to get my
tonsils out - no mention of removing the plaid lining in my sport jacket.  I
kept my tonsils, and have them today; they are healthier than the rest of me,
having been exercised much more vigorously.

<p>

An expert machine operator?  One appeared.  Machine repairs?  A very good man
was on call.  A receptionist?  A secretary for Eckert?  More plugwires?
Coming right up!  Ah, IBM!

<p>

The operator was an oldtimer named Cliff, who had the machine room culture
down pat.  He could joggle a vast wodge of cards, carried a sorting needle,
knew how to stick chips back in a card for a quick fix.  The customer engineer
(IBM for "maintenance expert") showed me where the machine
<a name="[-30-]"><font color="red">[-30-]</font></a>
blueprints were
hidden.  Lillian knew these things as well, but thought astronomers should be
above such details; when I got tired of imitating Cliff I would sidle upstairs
and talk to Everett Yowell, who was running the military project in the
Astronomical Bureau for her (years later he was scientific marketing manager
for NCR).  He didn't have his Columbia degree yet, and had to be affable.

<p>

One day an attractive young blonde - sharp features, summer freckles, clear
voice - came up from 590.  Her name was Marjorie Severy, and she had just
graduated from Wellesley with a math major.  The personnel people thought she
would make a possible machine room supervisor.  She was just what we needed.

<p>

By this time Eckert and I knew that the unit of temperature in my calculations
was a million degrees Kelvin, and so on.  We kept the equations I was working
with, and my translation into computable form (approved, with a warning, by
the great Johnnie on his first visit), and the starting values, in the big
safe.  What Marjorie and Cliff and the others saw was a long shelf of 28 IBM
plugboards, which when cycled through the various machines produced a messy
and unlabeled printout from the 405 tabulator.  While I bundled this up and
mailed it with my own hands, registered, to von Neumann - later, to Marshak -
at the anonymous Santa Fe box number, the machine room team began to repeat
the cycle.  We did two a day; each predicted the temperature and pressure up
to the (moving) shock wave after one more time step - a millisecond.  Allowing
for the fact that we did not work Sundays, that was 50,400,000 times as slow
as the real atomic explosion!  A Cray 2 today would be ten million times
faster - and give you Saturday off besides!

<p>

About von Neumann's warning: he instantly realized that Eckert and I were
experts only on numerical solutions of systems of ordinary differential
equations, which are central to all the problems of celestial mechanics.  I
had had a good course in quantum theory in graduate school, but no practice in
solving those kinds of partial differential equations numerically.  Nor had
Eckert; in fact, nobody had - solutions took much more computing power than
the physicists were accustomed to in 1940.

<p>

The little group of Giant Brains at Los Alamos, especially Feynman and the
card pushers, had learned from Johnnie and from sad experience that if a
certain ratio of distance interval to time interval was exceeded, the numbers
went wild.  I was told to check after each time step to make sure that ratio
was still all right - a minor desk calculator operation.  One of our new
hires, a bluestocking named Liz Ward, did our desk calculator work.  After
figuring out where the shock wave had gotten to, she did the little ratio
calculation carefully, but neglected to report to Marjorie or to me when the
ratio went bad.  And I didn't look over her shoulder: mea culpa!

<p>

So I had to get on the telephone to Johnnie and confess we had blown two
cycles - a day's work.  "Dr.  von Neumann, suppose I run a smoothing operation
to get rid of the ripples?  Will it distort what follows?" "That will make a
nice dissertation topic in applied mathematics after the war, Grosch.
Meanwhile, to be safe, do the last three time steps over." And there went
Sunday!

<p>
<a name="[-31-]"><font color="red">[-31-]</font></a>
Eckert and I had clearances, and access to that safe.  McPherson had even
higher clearances - IBM was involved in cryptography, for instance - but no
need to know.  The machine room gang had none, although they did know they
were doing something very important.  Oh, and the listings I mailed to Los
Alamos had no hand-written labels, but matched a labeled master copy that had
been carried back by Feynman: primitive but exceedingly effective security.

<p>

Then it was August 6, and the radio and the newspapers told us about
Hiroshima.  We knew what we had been working on, and that tens of thousands of
Japanese civilians had been incinerated.  Before the moral pressures could
mount, events swept us away.  The war in the Pacific ended, the war in Europe
ended.  All our perspectives lengthened overnight - from a few months "to the
end of the war," to the long reaches of peace.

After almost five years of war, peace was a stranger.  And I did not remember
it all that fondly, especially when I thought back before my college years.
The Great Depression had been pretty awful for a youngster, especially near
Detroit, where the clang of closing factory doors was nastily punctuated by
the splat! of defenestrated bankers.

<p>

My parents, Bessie Mabel Adams ("Mabel") and Reuben John Grosch ("Bert", since
his father had also been Reuben), had emigrated from England to Western
Canada.  They were both Londoners - Walthamstovians, and from large families.
Dad had been apprenticed as a cabinetmaker, and retained the skills all his
life - made very handsome violins as a hobby during the Evil Thirties.  The
rather Germanic name stretched back through a line of furniture makers,
perhaps to the Hanover accession with its train of tradesmen - always in the
London suburbs.  Dad broke the pattern; came out to Saskatchewan as a
construction carpenter, and sent for Mabel as soon as he had his feet under
him.  They were married in 1912.  I was born in Saskatoon in 1918 in Caesarean
style, and survived only because the Central Hospital had just added an
incubator to its equipment.  Not surprisingly, I remained the only child.

<p>

We moved steadily eastward in the next years.  When I finally got back to my
birthplace fifty years later, I asked my hosts to drive me past the hospital
to see if there was a plaque to their first (and presumably most famous)
incubator baby; alas! they had torn the place down.  My host, Andy Booth,
ex-Birkbeck College, London, and builder of the first British drum computer,
claimed they had sown salt in the ashes!

<p>

I went to school in Ontario; first in Chatham, then in Windsor.  Canadian
schools did not, at least in those less-U.S.-influenced days, let a student
sit
<a name="[-34-]"><font color="red">[-34-]</font></a>
idle; I spent one semester in each grade and ended up three years ahead of
myself.  I remember only one teacher clearly.  The provincial government was
instituting French classes as I was zooming through the sixth grade [1928],
and I can still sing a few phrases about the bridge of Avignon.

<p>

My father had been inside superintendent and senior detailer for a Detroit
fine-woodworking company, commuting across the river each day.  He was offered
a better job in Toledo, Ohio, and worked there for a few months while coming
home to Windsor on weekends - via interurban trolley, today only a hobbyist's
dream.  He persuaded Mabel to put away her English preferences and emigrate
yet again.

<p>

Parenthetically, he soon became a U.S. citizen, and conferred the same
citizenship on me by the derivative route, but my mother remained a determined
British subject.  George V and George VI were much more real to her than our
all-enveloping FDR.  Yet although she corresponded copiously with relatives
and friends in England from 1912 until her death in 1962, she never showed the
slightest interest in going back to visit the country that seemed to hold her
loyalties.

<p>

I started the seventh grade at Alexander Hamilton Junior High School in
Toledo, a few days before my tenth birthday.  The teachers were dubious,
especially when they found that I believed the Canadians had won the War of
1812!  Within a month or two the science teacher, Mrs. Linhart, and I had
started the school's first Science Club.  A few weeks more and I was writing
for the school paper, usually the province of the eighth graders.  My English
teacher, Miss Morgan, reported to Mother that she wanted to hug me, and to
shake my head off, on alternate days - an emotion shared often in later years
by a long string of wives, managers and friends.

<p>

In the spring rehearsals began for the Annual Play, customarily dominated by
the older grade.  But this year the staff had chosen "Benjamin Franklin",
which required a smallish boy to be on stage continuously, gabbling away the
while.  Guess who was the only boy in AH that could memorize the part?

<p>

I loved it - loved being up there in front of those kids and teachers and
parents, the center of all attention.  It turned out that in spite of my
glasses, and my reading, and my science club, and my good grades, I was a Born
Ham.

<p>

The previous August I had persuaded my dubious father to buy me my first
AMAZING STORIES, the pioneer Gernsback science fiction magazine, which I read
without missing an issue for over a dozen years.  Twenty five cents, it cost,
and had a drawing of Jupiter as seen from Ganymede on the cover, and the
original Buck Rogers story ("Armageddon, 2419 A.D.") inside.  I had started
with the Oz books at five, and Dr. Doolittle; then Verne; then a heavy dose of
mythology - Greek, Roman, Norse, even Hindu.  Well before my tenth birthday I
was off into space!

<p>

AMAZING led me to Wells and Burroughs, and a year or two later the first
issues of ASTOUNDING appeared on the newsstands, with science as well as
fiction.  Perhaps more importantly, I graduated from the primarily juvenile
library collection in the basement of the Toledo school, to an adult public
library, and later to the large main Detroit Public Library.  Reading had to
be the prime resource of a boy three years younger and a head shorter than his
classmates.

<p>

One of my teachers got me enrolled in a Saturday class at the very good Toledo
Museum of Art, and I liked it.  But I really wasn't much at fine arts, and
enjoyed wandering among the collections more than being creative with pen and
brush.  A modern color graphics terminal would have helped, of course.

<p>

And I discovered sex.  Given my social disabilities, it didn't involve girls
or women, or even boy friends
<a name="[-35-]"><font color="red">[-35-]</font></a>
- just what the Victorians rightly called
"solitary" and wrongly called "vice".  I was barely ten.  I thought it was
terrific.  Not one day has passed since that first wonderful discovery without
my wishing for or planning for - or on good days, experiencing - the manifold
pleasures of sex.

<p>

The company Dad had worked for in Detroit, a private outfit named Moynes,
which did fancy churches and Grosse Pointe mansions and lots of circular
staircases, wanted him back, and came down to Toledo and said so.  This was
1930; in the Fifties and Sixties, when I was asked back for second hitches by
IBM and GE and Uncle Sam, I often thought of his experience.  He was
flattered, as I was later; he accepted.  We moved to a convenient Detroit
suburb, Royal Oak, and I entered the ninth grade at the senior high school.  I
was barely twelve.  The Great Depression was only a few months away.  I don't
remember much about mathematics in Windsor or Toledo.  Skipping ahead as I
did, I missed whole chunks of arithmetic and only noticed it once, when a
review examination revealed I had never had decimals!  I did the whole exam on
the assumption that 6.28 meant 6 and 1/28th, got an abysmal grade, and
discovered the right system by myself, in a week or two.  The teacher never
knew.

<p>

At Royal Oak I took considerable pleasure in algebra and geometry, and was so
expert that in my senior year I sometimes sat in as instructor for the
freshman algebra teacher's last class while he coached football.  At the end
of my second year my geometry teacher, Miss Gibson, who was to teach
junior-year algebra, gave me the next textbook to work over during the long
summer vacation, graded my problems and administered a mini-final examination
in October, and excused me from classes.  In my senior year we did solid
geometry in the fall and trigonometry in the spring; the latter introduced me
to logarithms, and I spent many hours in class - while the others sweated -
building a better seven-place table from a curious book I got from the town
library which had accurate logs, but of prime numbers only.

<p>

From that same library - adult side, but they had lots of Jules Verne on the
juvenile side! - I got the Granville Smith and Longley calculus text which
turned out next year to be used in my college class.  I tried to master it on
my own, but stuck at the approach to the limit idea.  I asked my trig teacher,
Miss Kirk, for help, only to learn she had never had calculus and taught her
"advanced" classes by rote.  I was disillusioned.

<p>

On the Ham side, I soon discovered debating, a big thing in that part of the
Middle West, with a statewide competition among high schools each year and
even college scholarships similar to but less plush than those for football
and basketball stars.  But it was the public-appearance thing I enjoyed,
especially when it involved a trip to another high school, and a fresh
audience.  I soon became the expert rebutter and "closer", much improved the
Royal Oak standing in the state, and captained the squad my senior year.

<p>

On the science side, I became unofficial lab assistant in chemistry, had the
<a name="[-36-]"><font color="red">[-36-]</font></a>
complete run of the shop for two years while the teacher, Mr. Erickson, very
good indeed but also busy coaching track, watched my struggles to do primitive
qualitative analysis without a good balance (I remember making standard
solutions with constant-boiling hydrochloric acid and lots of pipette/burette
work).

<p>

My father cut into a gas line at home and inserted the appropriate fixture so
I could have a Bunsen burner instead of an alcohol lamp.  I did the usual
dangerous flashlight powder/ thermite/ gunpowder experiments in our back yard,
and decided to be a research chemist.  All this was amplified by a steady flow
of books from the big Detroit Public Library, for which I managed to promote
an adult permit on the strength of Dad's employment a few blocks away.  I was
then just thirteen, but persuasive!

<p>

Physics was a bust.  Astronomy I studied out of AMAZING and ASTOUNDING, plus
dull books from my three libraries (there was a rather good library in the
high school also).  I didn't confuse the sources; I already understood at
twelve or thirteen that H.G. Wells' "cavorite", which took his confused heroes
to the Moon, was an impossibility - and why.

<p>

This is a good place to explain why I flourished so early, and yet didn't turn
into some kind of a monster.  I was immersed in a rather ordinary environment
- good schools, good teachers, but nothing like the Bronx High School of
Science, or the Cambridge or Pasadena hotbeds.  And everything was seriously
damped by the Depression, which was raging with special virulence in the
Detroit area.  That meant no travel, very little spending money, very few
purchased books, and at school very limited equipment.

<p>

On the other hand, my parents and all my teachers were enormously supportive.
The former never really understood what I did after I finished high school,
but they were proud of my honors and my Ph.D. and my mysterious jobs.  They
watched me as Benjamin Franklin and as debating captain, came to all the
school events - but shunned the PTA.  My teachers were no great minds, but
they worked far harder, especially on me and the other bright kids, than they
would today; teaching was still honored in Canada, and a stable and fairly
well-paid job in Toledo and Royal Oak - and the Depression sharpened their
appreciation.

<p>

Of course it seemed like a struggle at the time, and I had occasional setbacks
and social disfunctions, but compared to most youngsters in those Depression
years I had a red-carpet path.  My debating coach, Miss Moore, got me the
offer of a scholarship at Albion College; my Latin teacher, Mrs. Land, was an
active alumna of the University of Michigan, and helped me apply for and win a
tuition scholarship there - and that, I accepted.

<p>

If I had been surrounded by really fancy teachers, or if my parents had been
intellectuals, I would have been steered to Harvard or Cal Tech or whatever,
and with much more generous scholarship support - I saw this quite clearly
after only a couple of years at Ann Arbor.  And I could have upgraded myself,
but by then I was doing published research - at seventeen! - and was far too
engrossed to make the effort.

<p>

About the high school social thing: I yearned for girls and cars and
sophistication just like other boys, but I was too small for athletics, too
young to drive or work (and there were no jobs, anyhow), and too intellectual
to be
<a name="[-37-]"><font color="red">[-37-]</font></a>
a smoothie.  I managed a year of "going steady" when I was a junior, and
only fourteen, but was dissatisfied with the meager sensual pleasures extended
by my lovely but cautious girl friend, and regressed to less frequent dating
as a senior.

<a name="[-39-]"><font color="red">[-39-]</font></a>
I arrived in Ann Arbor on the 16th of September [1934], just three days after
my birthday.  Freshmen had to be sixteen on registration day, which was the
25th for Names Starting With G; I made it with 12 days to spare!  The new
Alumni Scholars were welcomed during Freshman Week by the president, a
herpetologist named Ruthven.  I next shook hands with him when I received my
doctoral diploma in 1942 (when I got my bachelor's, he handed it to me at
diploma length).  It was a big place, not at all like Royal Oak Senior High
School, and I was excited and challenged.

<p>

There were a thousand rules and regulations about course selection.  I had
studied the catalogue for months, and knew it much better than my advisor, but
was unable to find a way into the "professional" introductory chemistry class;
the department wanted you to have calculus along with it, and calculus was
normally a sophomore subject.  The best I could do with math was to choose the
"professional" introduction, which got you ready for differential equations as
a sophomore, but clearly didn't do calculus for many weeks.  Physics was also
impossible, and with more justification; the budding chemists didn't use
calculus at all, even in the second semester, and the budding physicists
certainly could have used it - but usually didn't.

<p>

I wiggled on the hook.  In a careless moment the advisor allowed me to sign up
for the entry astronomy course, which really was also for sophomores.  It was
a snap for someone who had been reading and rereading Verne, Wells, AMAZING
STORIES and ASTOUNDING STORIES for six enthralled years.  By the time an
assistant dean called me on the carpet for being in a sophomore subject, I was
leading the class, and the laboratory class as well.  He could see I had been
a knowing infractor - but he let me stay!

<p>

I had been depressed that my trigonometry teacher had not known calculus.  Now
I was in a different league; my math professor was a famous mathematician, who
took the advanced freshman section to encourage entry
<a name="[-40-]"><font color="red">[-40-]</font></a>
into the field.  My
astronomy lecturer was a real live researcher who became director of the
Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria a few years later.  Even my
English class was taught by a publishing poet, who was also proselytizing (it
too was an advanced section).

<p>

And I made the freshman debating squad.

<p>

The Depression was fierce.  Dad managed to get me a little summer work as a
helper, building a temporary keg-washing plant for the Stroh Brewery in
Detroit - alas, I had not yet learned to drink beer, pails of which I brought
out for the delighted carpenters.  I suspected it was a non-standard
arrangement; there were unions about, and I was still only sixteen.  And it
was heavy work - but how I needed the money!

<p>

Ann Arbor was a relief that fall.  With my tiny earnings I found a single room
in a nicer boarding house: great landlady and good housemates (I lived there
contentedly until I left for Washington six years later).  I signed up for an
advanced astronomy course, and unknowingly set all the rest of my career in
train.  I had been drawn to the astronomers of my freshman year, and chose
physics in the new term - yes, the fancy course - instead of chemistry, and to
take an extra fifth subject, as a consequence.  But in September [1935] I was
also thinking about being a mathematician or a physicist; by Christmas, those
options had pretty well faded.

<p>

The fifth course was Astronomy 101, Practical Astronomy - the old-fashioned
stuff that had been the entry to classical astronomy for centuries, and was
then withering under the fires of relativity and quantum mechanics and
astrophysics.  There were only ten students.  Most of the others were seniors
and graduate students majoring in other subjects (surveying and navigation and
such), and there were two or three apprentice astrophysicists.  I was the
first student who ever elected the course before choosing a major, and was
five or six years younger than the rest.

<p>

We were to do the old precise-measurement kind of astronomy: use of the
meridian circle and the chronometer and the filar micrometer.  No photography.
No spectroscopy.  Very accurate.  Lots of spherical trigonometry; in fact, it
was the only course in the university which taught that variety of math
heavily.

<p>

The professor was one Allan Douglas Maxwell, unhappy with the way that his
kind of astronomy was being brushed aside by the astrophysicists, and hungry
for a disciple.  He had been at Ann Arbor for nearly ten years and had not had
a single doctoral candidate.  His father had been a streetcar conductor in
Woodland, California, and by his mathematical aptitude Maxwell had won
scholarships and prizes at UC Berkeley.  He became the final disciple of Armin
Leuschner, then chairman of the department and head of the Student Observatory
(not to be confused with Lick, on a mountaintop behind San Jose, where the
Real Research was done).

<p>

Leuschner had spent much of his career reformulating old methods of computing
the orbits of asteroids and comets for "modern" calculating techniques.  He
discouraged the use of six-place addition-subtraction logarithm tables, used
a hand-cranked German Brunsviga desk calculator and tables of natural trig
functions, and looked forward to the days when many computers - remember,
computers were still people in those days - when many computers would have
access to calculators with (gasp!)  electrical motors.

<p>

<a name="[-41-]"><font color="red">[-41-]</font></a>
Maxwell found this immensely satisfying.  He did a thesis, helped Leuschner
write and publish a major text on orbit computing methods, corresponded with
the other dozen or so specialists elsewhere in the U.S.  He was ready to go
out into the world.  The University of Michigan had a tradition in the field
and in the specialty: there had been an active observatory in Ann Arbor for
over a century, and one former director was James Craig Watson, whose book
Theoretical Astronomy had been the standard American text for (logarithmic)
orbit computing since 1867.  Even the astrophysicists conceded that Ann Arbor
should have another orbit man, and Maxwell had been their choice.

<p>

He taught by demonstration.  At the blackboard he would derive the appropriate
expressions for computation, and then distribute beautifully prepared
computing sheets, with an example filled in on one page or set.  We called
them computing forms, and they were the equivalent of programs - the term
"software" would not be invented for more than twenty years.  They directed
the computer, Maxwell himself or a student, step by step through the complex
calculation.  The sample showed how many decimal places to carry, neither too
few nor too many, and he would justify the choice and recommend calculating
tools and tricks as we went along.  Just as in today's software, bugs
sometimes showed up, or (much more frequently) Maxwell would see a better way
to do the job.  Then the forms would be revised or replaced.

<p>

Instead of a laser page printer he had his personal hectograph machine.  It
was a long roll of jelly on a cloth backing.  He would draw a form in
hectograph ink on bond paper, roll out a fresh foot of reproducing surface,
press the original face down for just the right number of minutes, peel it
carefully off, and then draw off duplicate forms on plain paper until the
copies became too faint or blurry (copiers were also twenty years in the
future!).  When the takeup roll was full he would go back to the beginning,
where the six-month-old image had completely absorbed, and start over.  I
thought such modern technology was terrific.  Why, you could even use more
than one color!

<p>

Maxwell did all his calculations in ink, and admonished us to do likewise.  I
did; the others tried, and reverted to pencil.  He told us that engineers had
to do many calculations in bound laboratory books, for patent and similar
reasons, and that they worked in ink and crossed out but never obliterated
errors.  "In practical astronomy and especially in orbit calculations, which
you will do in Astronomy 201, the calculations are so voluminous that the
sheets would be a mess, so I use ink eradicator on my mistakes, and write
again in ink after the spot is nice and dry" - much shifting in their seats by
the poor victims, who were mostly resolving never, never to take 201.  I
adopted his tactics enthusiastically, and in later years helped him experiment
on what combination of paper, eradicator and fountain pen ink worked best (one
of the Hammermill bonds, Clorox [!!], and blue Washable Quink).  I made very
few mistakes; indeed, I didn't dare!

<p>

One of the young astrophysikers dropped out.  The surveyors and would-be
navigators grumbled.  Then, metaphorically at least, the heavens opened.  An
astronomer named Delporte, at the Uccle Observatory near Brussels,
photographed a very rapidly moving asteroid.  Even assuming the motion was
<a name="[-42-]"><font color="red">[-42-]</font></a>
entirely lateral, and against the grain of the solar system, it could not move
so fast unless it was closer than any previously observed body - except
meteoroids, of course.  The world orbit-computing experts were agog, at all
eight or ten sites: Harvard, Leningrad, Berkeley, Greenwich, Cincinnati, Ann
Arbor et al.

<p>

Observations were sent by specially-coded telegrams from a central bureau.
Maxwell started in.  But he needed a check computer, who would work twenty or
thirty hours straight and not make many more mistakes - hopefully, different
ones - than he himself.  The forms were ready, although like today's software,
"a few small changes" were required.  Ignoring the child labor laws, and the
fact that I had an examination in Physics 35 scheduled for the next day, he
drafted me!

<p>

I still have the sheets.  Faded now, and not at all elegant because I had
never done anything that serious and that urgent before, they mark my
initiation.  I was barely seventeen.  I loved the whole thing; I was doing
research, just like a real astronomer or an AMAZING STORIES hero.  And in the
end I got an A in the physics course anyhow.  I had become a computer.

<p>

Maxwell was my leader for almost six years.  I took my Ph.D. from him, but
much more important, learned numerical analysis and practical computing as his
apprentice.  Neither of us doubted, from early 1936, that I would follow the
line, through Oppolzer the eclipse computer and Leuschner the asteroid
computer (he had been Oppolzer's disciple in Germany) and Maxwell the comet
computer, to become Grosch the (as it turned out) satellite computer.

<p>

There were obstacles, mostly financial.  I was literally undernourished.  My
parents managed five dollars a week my freshman year, out of which I paid room
rent of $1.25 [!], surely the lowest in Ann Arbor, saved toward next
semester's textbooks, and bought AMAZING and ASTOUNDING of course.  A
wonderful thick malted milk was ten cents in those days, and a large hamburger
the same, but it was several years before I could afford breakfast.  It will
give some idea of my priorities to note that I always bought brand new
textbooks, even when used ones were available, and that after dozens of
transcontinental and intercontinental moves I still have the best of them - no
longer pristine - on my office bookshelves!

<p>

The sophomore year started out only a little better; my earnings as a summer
worker were minuscule.  But I was quickly adopted by the observatory "family".
The University of Michigan Observatory sat on a knoll across from the big
teaching hospital, which was unfortunate for the observing astrophysicists
because of light pollution, but good for me because it was within walking
distance of the main campus and my boarding house.  The director, a wonderful
warm old guy named Heber Curtis, lived in an attached residence which went
with the job, and used to walk through the intervening halls and library at
all hours, often finding Maxwell and his prize catch computing away,
independent of bad observing weather.

<p>

Maxwell used to take me out for late snacks after such sessions, and observed
my scrawny state.  I ate everything the all-night Greek cafe could produce,
including messes I couldn't look at today after decades of gourmet
<a name="[-43-]"><font color="red">[-43-]</font></a>
dining all over the world.  He reported this to Curtis, who first produced a
$50 "assistantship" (it was too late in the budget cycle to do more), then in
my third year somehow awarded me half of a graduate astronomy fellowship, and
later heavily supported my applications for larger scholarships and
fellowships.  Also, fearing that I might collapse under the 8-by-10 beams of
my construction job, Curtis gave me summer observing assistantships in 1936
and 1937, ostensibly "to show you what most astronomers do at night", but
really to provide eating money.  I was nurtured by Maxwell and Curtis, and
intellectually by the other astronomers as well: nice, nice memories.

<p>

The office that I was to share for more than five years was at the end of the
main block, and butted on to the circular wall of the main reflecting
telescope.  This was convenient during thunderstorms, since the dome was
metal, and Maxwell, who was deathly afraid of lightning, could unobtrusively
slip out of his quarters and be safe.  The observatory carpenter had built a
set of inexpensive shelves along another wall, and on these shelves sat sixty
or so identical cardboard suitcases, the size of a large attache case.  Almost
everything Maxwell owned was in these cases or elsewhere in the office; he
kept his meager wardrobe and linen in his nearby apartment, but his
professional and private belongings were "at work".

<p>

An unwilling bachelor of 36 or so, he belonged to a faculty eating club called
"The Apostles".  He would rise early - when he had not been up all night
computing or, on clear nights, observing - put on a clean shirt and one of his
two somber suits, and go to his club for breakfast.  He would then go to the
office, where in my thesis years he would find me banging away after an
all-night computing session, and take down Suitcase 14.  Opening it at his
desk, he would take out his electric razor (the first one I had ever seen;
they were quite new) and a small round magnifying mirror, and shave.  Putting
these tools carefully away, he would next take out a large paper envelope
containing one empty and six laden smaller ones, labeled for the days of the
week.  Slipping the noose of yesterday's necktie over his head, he would put
it in the empty envelope.  Taking today's equally dull necktie from its
envelope, he would put it on, draw the loop tight, and be ready for the day.
Except for infrequent trips to astronomical meetings, he did this every single
day of the year.  He was never ill.

<p>

I have mentioned that the computing forms were often replaced by improved
ones.  Obsolete forms were cut in half and saved, since their blank back sides
made admirable scratch paper for calculations, first drafts of letters, and
such.  When I was made Keeper Of The Suitcases in 1937 - or to be more
precise, Indexer - "we" had three suitcases of scratch paper, and the number
grew to five by the time I left for the Naval Observatory.  Maxwell's rather
small technical library was in university-issue bookcases; his professional
correspondence was in suitcases, his tiny family mail likewise; his skimpy
loveletters and miniature diaries were in a locked tin box in his desk (but
the spare key was in a carefully labeled envelope in Suitcase 1).

<p>

Our days revolved around two other possessions, however.  When he made me a
computer in late 1935, he had two Monroe calculators on trial.  One was full
size, and had electric shifting - you held down the plus or minus bar for the
six or less revolutions of a multiplication (for seven, say, you
<a name="[-44-]"><font color="red">[-44-]</font></a>
"shortcut" by doing one forward, shift, three backward; shortcutting saved 27
percent compared to just holding down the motor bar and gritting your teeth at
the nines), then shifted with an adjacent bar.  The other was, ahem, a mini,
and you shifted the carriage with a knob (left hand) while you held down one
motor bar or the other (right hand).  It had never occurred to me until I
wrote these lines that there were no left-handed desk calculators, manual or
electric!

<p>

I did the check computing on the Delporte Object with the mini, and Maxwell
used the bigger and faster machine.  We agreed the other way around would have
evened out our speeds, but he had additional chores to do while I was plugging
away, such as decoding the observations coming in by wire.  Oh, and teaching
his classes!

<p>

Next year [1936] he tried the equivalent Friden, which shortcuts automatically
when you push the multiplier digit on a separate keypad, and the
top-of-the-line Marchant, which had multiplier keys up the right edge of the
main keyboard, and a higher RPM.  In the end he bought the mini-Monroe and the
Marchant, Model ACT-10M.  And the observatory had a communal Heavy Old Monroe,
which sat in the conference room.  It had been retrofitted with a giant
external electric motor, and experiment revealed that if you pushed down all
of the keys on the keyboard - that is, ten in each of the ten columns - held
down the motor bar, and switched on the motor, the entire sixty-pound
contraption would leap at least half an inch vertically.

<p>

It drew only a few users, and most of the staff used logarithms - the
astrophysicists, Maxwell and I would say scathingly, only needed six-inch
pocket sliderules.

<p>

My esteemed preceptor - and, needless to say, good friend, although I always
called him "Dr.  Maxwell" until I left his tender care - had three goals.  He
wanted to get married (I considered that a euphemism, but bluntness was not
appreciated), he wanted to have a nice car, and he wanted the best calculator
available.  But he only earned $3500 a year, so he settled for buying his own
machines (the Marchant was over $600, even with a professorial discount) and a
drab second-hand Chevrolet, and yearning after the pretty young girls he saw
going to the classes of the other Apostles.  Alas, he complained, no such
lovelies ever elected Astronomy 101, let alone 201!

<p>

He made no effort to steer my course selections in the following years, mostly
because he approved of my choices.  I took all the astronomy courses, a great
deal of mathematics - not too pure - and as little other than sciences as the
regulations permitted.  But I was deeply interested in the outside world; as
my finances improved I joined a local rental library, brooded over Mussolini
and Hitler, and for broader themes managed to get a stack permit for the huge
Main Library, where I read mountaineering and city planning and fine
bookbinding, and Rider Haggard.  The Observatory, physics and math libraries
were very good, and Curtis would approve special purchases for me (and other
apprentices); I still remember his permitting me to get the Oberth text on
rocketry, and another serious German book by Hohmann about space travel
trajectories.

<p>

Maxwell had not been infected with academic greed.  Where the poor physics
grad students were doing research in the name of their advisors, or
<a name="[-45-]"><font color="red">[-45-]</font></a>
helping build the Michigan cyclotron - not only without credit but mostly even
without pay - my guy was routinely making me co-author of "our" publications
and even nominating me for membership in the American Astronomical Society -
at twenty! Sure, he yearned for a disciple, and wanted me to stay around, but
he was naturally generous - and disapproved of the way other youngsters were
exploited.

<p>

What has stayed with me, and what (mostly through me) he contributed to the
philosophy, the morality if you will, of modern computing, were the ideas of
economy and elegance.  The first lessons were elementary - don't work to seven
places if five will do, use the special qualities of the machine at your
disposal, make your computing forms carefully and revise them continually.
Then he showed me the ways of using higher differences in tablemaking, so as
to minimize the size of complex calculations, and introduced me to the
publications of one L.J. Comrie, then head of the Almanac Office at Greenwich.
The economy he had had to learn because he worked alone so much; the pleasures
of accuracy and neatness and elegance were natural to him.

<p>

It wasn't all sweetness and light.  I got uppity, and poked fun at some of his
idiosyncrasies, and he sat on me firmly.  For nearly a year [1938/39] I
drifted away from him toward what you might call computational astrophysics:
the use of fancy applied math to explore stellar interiors, following the work
of an Indian at Yerkes named Subramanyan Chandrasekhar.  I got excited about
mechanized computing - punched cards - after reading Comrie and Wallace
Eckert, and was unhappy when Maxwell would not introduce me to the local
expert in Angell Hall, who did much administrative stuff and a little
statistics, and years later published one of the first books on matrix
arithmetic.

<p>

What drew me back in the end, along with the old friendship and his continuing
support, was another discovery.  An astronomer at Mount Wilson named Seth
Nicholson, who was allowed to use the 100-inch for old-fashioned direct
photography, announced two new satellites of Jupiter, X and XI, and the
recovery of VIII and IX, which had not been identified for several years.  I
was intrigued with the odd problem of preliminary satellite orbits, which
didn't seem to be in the textbooks.  I was about ready to start thesis
research, having decided to pass up a master's degree as not useful in
astronomy (holders seemed to end up as planetarium lecturers, and NASA and the
missile boys were two decades ahead).  How about the new Jupiter moons?

<p>

Maxwell was willing, but pointed out that the observational material was
pretty skimpy for a definitive orbit, and that out at the edge of Jupiter's
gravitational dominion the solar perturbations would be enormous, and
therefore hard to calculate.  I set to work to investigate.  Much to my
surprise, I found that multiple solutions were possible.  On reflection, you
realize that an observed direction would be the same if the satellite were "in
front" or "behind" Jupiter - that is, less or more distant from the observer
than its primary - and that four combinations of early and late observations
were possible.  Three of these fit the mid-range data only for very strange
orbital parameters; the fourth was probably right, but you could only be sure
after the new satellite had been observed for a near-revolution.

<p>

I had won a super fellowship for my first full graduate year, 1938-39: one
<a name="[-46-]"><font color="red">[-46-]</font></a>
of the new Rackhams, a gigantic $1000.  I got my teeth fixed, bought a better
radio and a three-speed bicycle, and still had money left over.  I decided to
attend an all-summer conference at Harvard Observatory, where Fred Whipple and
Leland Cunningham, contenders with Maxwell and Grosch for the orbit computing
championship, held forth.  I gave a conference talk about the multiple
solution thing, which was well received, but found out from Whipple that Paul
Herget of Cincinnati had sort of staked out the two new satellites, with the
concurrence of Nicholson.

<p>

I wrote Nicholson, and he replied promptly that Herget was really being a
little ambitious because of observational deficiencies, that IX seemed to be
lost again, but that there was a wealth of data going back thirty years for
VIII.  Moreover, VIII seemed to be the most highly perturbed satellite in the
solar system, and had already been lost (and recovered) three times.  "A
really good job would not only keep that from happening again, Mr. Grosch, but
one might later make a very valuable determination of the mass of Jupiter"
(relative to the Sun, that is).  I announced to a waiting world - about six
people, including not only Maxwell and Curtis and Nicholson and Whipple and
Herget but a woman in Leningrad named Boeva, who had done the best orbit so
far - that I would massage VIII to a fare-thee-well.

<p>

It was probably more than I should have tackled.  A reasonable thesis topic
would have given me my Ph.D. in mid-1941, at 22.  The usual age for the degree
in those simpler times, at least for astronomers, was 27 or 28 if you worked
right through (unusual even then).  As it was, the huge mass of calculations
took 2500 hours of all-night Marchant work - I kept meticulous logs, as
Maxwell would have done - up to May 1941, when I left Ann Arbor for the Naval
Observatory job, and many hours more in Washington.  Still, I got done with
everything except the writing by Pearl Harbor time, and was able to take my
doctorate at the 1942 Commencement.

<p>

This chapter is not really about my doctorate, but about an early and
effective computer now almost forgotten.  There were dozens like him, and not
just in the United States.  Some were innovators, like Wallace Eckert.  Some
were caught up in the early machine revolution, like Paul Herget.  Comrie, by
far the greatest of the clan, was elected to the Royal Society for his
contributions, but died before the Big Boom.  Maxwell, having helped me so
much, dipped a toe in the waters and pulled back.

<p>

He wrote me about his discouragement with astrophysicists.  Should he follow
me to the Naval Observatory (I was well into IBM by then), and would his
preference for and his expertise in hand computation be valuable? "Allan," I
said, "what you do is basic to any kind of calculation, and vital for
astronomy.  But these places are going to get electronic machines.  Can you
still work with youngsters using them, who need to be schooled in numerical
analysis, and encouraged to do better than just grind away?"

<p>

He went.  The Almanac Office got an IBM 650.  He returned to teaching, in
Washington, and told me the last time I saw him that he had more or less
retired his desk calculators, and reverted to logarithms.  He found it dull to
sit there and watch the machines - even the Marchant - "do all the work".

<p>

But I was delighted with him that day, and for a very intimate reason.  While
all this was going on, he had finally married.  Mona was an Ann Arbor
<a name="[-47-]"><font color="red">[-47-]</font></a>
town girl, proud to be the partner of such a clever and remarkable man.  After
all those years, he no longer needed fancy desk calculators.  He had a better
car.  And he had found a wife.

<p>

He was the best computer I ever worked with.  He died some years ago.  I
haven't forgotten him.

Maxwell and I more or less assumed I would follow in his academic footsteps,
although certainly not at Michigan or Harvard or Berkeley or Cincinnati, where
there was an ample supply of orbit computers - that is, one at each
institution.  We talked idly about the circumstances of Leland Cunningham, who
was an assistant to Fred Whipple, Maxwell's counterpart at Harvard.  We
decided that, as Cunningham did not seem to be getting a doctorate and did not
seem interested in marrying, he probably could stay on at Harvard
indefinitely, but at bicycle rather than used-car (let alone new-car) wages.
That didn't attract me.

<p>

My orbit of Jupiter VIII progressed forward from the 1938 observations through
1939, where I gleefully discovered that Nicholson's single published
observation at the 100-inch was of something else, and was able to tell him
where to look on his plates to find a genuine image.  I was beginning to run
the calculations the other way, to pick up and use the 1935 data, when the
summer of 1940 rolled around.

<p>

I had gone to the conferences at Harvard the year before, at my own expense,
and the 1940 version promised to be even better - a course by Dirk Brouwer,
undisputed international champion of fancy celestial mechanics, and an unusual
offering by a Harvard Society of Fellows chap named James Baker.  The latter
was giving lectures - perhaps the only ones he ever gave, since the war
carried him upstairs the next year - on his unusual optical design methods.
Some pages back I mentioned my attempt to design a field-flattening lens for
the peculiar Naval Observatory reflector - well, this was the methodology.
Baker turned out later be the very best lens designer in the whole world, and
the father of the Baker-Nunn cameras NASA used so enthusiastically in the
Sixties (and of their classified variants orbiting overhead).

<p>

Trouble was, I was not as flush as I had been in 1939.  I still had a good
<a name="[-50-]"><font color="red">[-50-]</font></a>
fellowship, thanks to Curtis and Maxwell, but not the lavish Rackham.  So I
wrote Harlow Shapley, the famous head of the Harvard Observatory, and asked
his help.  He produced a Summer School tuition scholarship, and a public-night
Dowse Institute lectureship.  I talked about the satellites of the solar
system, and got paid $100 - the very first money I ever earned by my speaking
talents.  Ham that I already was, I loved it - both the lecturing and the pay!

<p>

When Maxwell shipped me off he counseled me to be alert for attractive women
the first few days.  "I have been to many such conferences, and taught summer
classes, and the pretty ones get taken early", he said mournfully.  There had
been two or three possibilities in 1939, and I had indeed been too late to
pick one off.  Years of all-male graduate science classes had blunted what
little negotiating skills I had had in high school, and the four dates I had
managed with a lovely but wary creature from Michigan State that spring had
not re-sharpened them all that much; nevertheless, I promised to do my best,
and report.  We had shared many a Saturday night expedition to the Detroit
burlesque theaters, but it didn't seem likely I would attract anything that
spectacular.

<p>

A few days later I found myself and a reasonably attractive young professor
named Frank Edmondson paired off at Harvard with the two prettiest female
attendees.  By the luck of the draw - who was standing closest to whom - Frank
went with Katherine Gordon, who later turned out to have driven up from the
family apartment on Park Avenue [!] in her Packard convertible [!!].  My
partner was a Dorothy Carlson, from the Mount Wilson office in Pasadena - yes,
she knew Nicholson well - who had been saving for two years to see "the East",
and meet some younger astronomers.  She was delighted with the arrangement,
since it turned out Frank was married.  I was delighted because, in order to
share the rumble seat [!!!] with Frank, Kate let me drive the convertible on
all the double dates.  <i>Quelle exstase!</i>

<p>

Dorothy and I had a wonderful time together.  Because it was my second year at
the conference, because I had been helped very substantially by the ineffable
Shapley, and because a nice young couple was easier to accommodate socially
than awkward male singles, we were invited everywhere.  The Shapley family had
a complete set of Gilbert and Sullivan, album after album of heavy shellac
78s, and we went to their "evenings".  Afterwards we would wander around the
dark grounds of the observatory, and perhaps lie on the opened roof of the
patrol camera building and help watch for meteors.  Much handholding, much
kissing, much talk of futures (my future, mostly, as I remember).

<p>

We went with the younger crowd to Boston's Chinatown.  I had barely mastered
middlewestern chop suey, and only with a fork.  This bunch was full of
experts.  Dorothy was already more used to the Chinese cuisines than I, having
lived in Pasadena for years and gotten her degree from Berkeley, but managed
not to let me see it too often.  Mandarin was considered advanced in those
days; Szechuan and such had not arrived.  Still, I learned a lot.

<p>

There were trips to the country, notably a lightly chaperoned one to the main
observing station in a darker part of Massachusetts.  And we shared many good
evenings with Kate and Frank (and the Packard).  I reported most of this
<a name="[-51-]"><font color="red">[-51-]</font></a>
to Maxwell, emphasizing my charming companion's openness (and Mount Wilson
connections) and not her willowy figure, which would have disappointed his
stripteaser expectations.

<p>

I also reported on intellectual matters.  I was able to observe Whipple and
Cunningham close up, and discovered that Cunningham filled more than the
assistant role; in fact, was the real force in the computing work.  Neither of
them had Maxwell's passion for neatness, nor his interest in the performance
of desk calculators, nor in Comrie.  But it was obvious even to me that
Freddie was already a skilled politician, worthy of his Harvard tenure.  The
calculating work done during many later years at his so-called Smithsonian
Astrophysical installation confirmed my 1940 assessment; it was not
astrophysics, it was at Harvard rather than at the Smithsonian, it got major
press attention - and it was Whipple through and through.

<p>

Baker was harder to fathom.  I was enormously impressed with what he had done,
none of it reported in the literature.  He didn't hold back on his methods; on
the other hand, he talked equations rather than practical computing - how I
wished he would hand out forms, like Maxwell, or tell us how many trials he
had to make to finish one of his super-Schmidts!  He had a Friden in his
office, but clearly did most of his work at home.  Later, in the Fifties, he
had a major long-throw optical testing laboratory in the huge basement of his
Winchester house.  (He threw a party there for Optical Society people, and
hired Tom Lehrer, still a Harvard student, to entertain).  He was by then the
design genius behind Perkin-Elmer, and the source of the very best aerial
camera lenses.  He was elected president of the OSA.  But somehow he never hit
the publicity levels of, say, von Neumann or von Karman.

<p>

Two more stories about Baker, before I go back to the mating game.  He had a
curious problem at the end of the war: the Society of Fellows, of which he had
been a member for the years while he developed his methods and began to
demonstrate them, did not permit course credits.  You were supposed to do
research and think beautiful thoughts, and some day drop back into routine
Academe for your degree.  Jim did all this magnificent war work, and came back
(after being fawned on for several years by two-star generals and company
chairmen) to the realities of astronomy: no Ph.D., no instructorship.

<p>

Harvard was great; they called his secret NDRC reports and super lens designs
his "thesis", and awarded him a doctorate sort of by acclamation.  The
astronomers, however, were unforgiving - jealous of his reputation, which was
spread vigorously by the Perkin-Elmer organization to boost its already
excellent market position - and relegated him to a trial untenured slot out
West.  "Do some real astronomy", they said, "and then we'll see".  He took it
for a while, and finally went back to optical design; that was better for
everybody, astronomers and optickers and the whole world of technology.  But
it was still a sad story.

<p>

The other yarn is more technical.  When Watson gave Harvard the ASCC, Baker
went to see the irrascible Aiken.  High-aperture lens designs were known to
suffer from a computing <i>lacuna</i>.  Desk calculation was too slow and
expensive to permit the tracing of skew rays.  These were rays which did not
stay in one plane - the plane of the lens cross section.  They would have
taken six or eight times as much work per surface as the ones usually
traced; <a name="[-52-]"><font color="red">[-52-]</font></a> moreover, the
designers, since they never traced skew rays, had also never worked out how
to use the results.

<p>

You designed the lens in two dimensions, and tested a sample on the bench (the
effect of skew rays could be examined by using appropriate masks).  The
folklore of lens design, which was the stock in trade of Kingslake and his
father-in-law, much less familiar to Baker, and hardly known to me, said that
certain types of fast lenses, notably the Zeiss Sonnar family, suffered less
from wandering rays than most.  Some of Baker's methods bypassed this
difficulty, but he wanted to explore the problem in detail.

<p>

Aiken reluctantly let him write a skew ray program for the big machine, and
trace one ray.  Losing patience with the whole thing - perhaps partly because
the ASCC was by this time the, ahem, Navy MARK I, and Jim's wonderful designs
were for the Army Air Force - he ran the protesting young man off the
premises.  When I reported tracing thousands of skew rays on the SSEC in 1949
(and, not accidentally, through a Sonnar type), Baker told me he liked my
formulation, and had used a less satisfactory equation "on Aiken's machine",
which is how I first heard the story.  When I pressed him to say whether he
would use the new machines that were on the drawing boards, he put on his
Perkin Elmer hat.  Of course he and his assistants did in the end.

<p>

Well, Baker's course and Brouwer's course, and the ones Dorothy was taking,
came to their ends.  I pressed her to come down to the New York World's Fair
with me (absolutely no chaperones) but she had family visits to make.  In the
end I went alone, took notes on Gypsy Rose Lee and her competitors for
Maxwell, and got back in time to take Dorothy off the train in Detroit the
following week.  She met my parents, who were a little reserved - they feared
for that doctorate.  We went out to Ann Arbor and saw Maxwell, who approved
thoroughly.  That evening I put her on the train to Chicago and California.
We would meet at Christmas, in Pasadena, we agreed.

<p>

I ran Jupiter VIII back toward 1935 enthusiastically.  But I also resumed
talking to Maxwell about a job.  He thought things were rather quiet in all
the astronomical fields at the moment; there would be post-doctoral
fellowships at a few places like Yerkes and McDonald (in very remote Texas),
"but not for orbit men".  I cast about.  There was an announcement in SCIENCE
of an examination for openings at the U.S.Naval Observatory: Junior
Astronomer, $2000 a year.  Now, the starting salary in 1940 for an unmarried
instructor was around $1600 - maybe $1800 if married, but that was not
considered too sensible, at just 28 - so in spite of the high cost of living
in Washington, the stipend sounded pretty attractive.  And it would be my kind
of astronomy, not an appendage to astrophysics.

<p>

This was a competitive written technical examination, administered at the Ann
Arbor Post Office [!] by a Civil Service official.  Different from 1986:
instead of writing a FORTRAN program (or describing in poor English how
experienced you were at writing FORTRAN programs), you sat down with curious
logarithm tables furnished by the examiner and actually did sample
calculations.  It was easy for me; the budding astrophysicists across the
nation must have sweat gallons - well, liters!

<p>

I was surprised to run second in the country, of over a hundred aspirants; I
had assumed I would be an easy victor.  In fact, the victor, whom I knew
slightly, was named Victor, which probably accounted for his victory.  He
<a name="[-53-]"><font color="red">[-53-]</font></a>
ultimately did not take up the post, and in the early spring [1941], after a
marvelous Christmas, I got a stodgy telegram from the Secretary of the Navy -
well, that's what it said - offering me the job.  Needless to say, I packed up
Jupiter VIII and went.  What I found across the hall from my new office is
described in the following chapter.

<p>

About that Christmas: Dorothy and I corresponded four or five times a week all
through the fall.  I would bicycle down to the Ann Arbor station on my way to
an all-night session with the Marchant, and post my love letter in the slot on
the side of the Chicago-bound mail car as it came through just before
midnight.  Behind steam, big beautiful 60-inch-driver steam - what a thrill to
see your increasingly urgent literary efforts go ka-chuff, KA-CHUFF,
<u>KA-CHUFF</u> away to California.  A diesel would have seemed second rate!

<p>

We arranged I would come out to sunny Pasadena by Greyhound - three days, five
busses - as soon as school shut down.  That got me to Dorothy on Christmas
Eve, in time for Swedish Lutheran festivities and family celebrations.  I was
to stay a week, meet Nicholson of course, spend one night "up on the mountain"
- that is, in Kapteyn Cottage (for visiting astronomers) on Mount Wilson.  We
were to visit Griffith Planetarium, the Cal Tech workshop where the 200-inch
mirror for Palomar was being ground, and go down to Palomar itself.  John
Carlson donated the family car for much of this, and Dorothy's mother Ida and
brother Bob were fairly happy with me also.

<p>

Southern California was still smog-free.  There were lots of orange groves.
Each evening we parked up among them in Altadena, and shared a wonderful
private world - after the windows steamed up, that is!  We were definitely
engaged.  We would marry when I found a job.  We would not "spoil things" by
endangering my doctorate, however, so it looked like a rather long wait (I had
not yet heard that the Naval Observatory job was still unfilled).  The war in
Europe worried both of us.

<p>

There was a small problem about ages; Dorothy was six years older than I, and
nervous about my parents, and criticism.  I pointed out that I was now running
five years ahead of the pack in every other aspect of my life, and that she
could not just, ah, rob me of my precious virginity and run off into the
bushes (a very unsuccessful joke)!  We agreed most people would assume I was
her age - and that I would still be the youngest wolf in the pack.

<p>

Decades later I looked around and found I was the oldest wolf in a very, very
much larger pack.  I tried to remember the crossover but found I couldn't.
The biological clock keeps not only nonlinear but discontinuous time.

Before I get into the story of the world's first permanent rent-paying
scientific punched card computing laboratory I have to loop back to my
earliest days as a computer, in Ann Arbor.  Maxwell had set me down in front
of the Monroe and explained very briskly indeed - he was, in the inelegant
phrasing of today, hot to trot - how I was to check his preliminary orbit
calculations.  He had taken away his samples, so I would not be tempted to
duplicate his undetected mistakes, and left me to it.

<p>

Years later, when I was building up my first major staff in unexplored General
Electric, I used the same tactics.  I called it the swimming pool method: you
took the victim over to the edge at the deep end and gave a vigorous push.  If
you had picked your candidate for initiation correctly, he or she learned to
swim very quickly.

<p>

After you had a few swimmers, you moved on to the buddy system, which was in
vogue through most of the Fifties at 701 and 1103 installations.  Fewer
drownings!

<p>

Maxwell and I did a series of better orbits of the Delporte Object; it had by
then been assigned the temporary identification 1936 CA by the international
astronomical telegraph bureau which was sending out further observations.
Each of these efforts covered a longer stretch, and also utilized data from a
gaggle of remote observatories like Algiers which wanted to get into the act.
Things were a little calmer in Maxwell's sanctum, and I had time to wonder
what was in all those suitcases!

<p>

In early 1936 "we" decided to do a definitive orbit.  The little rock that was
causing all the excitement had now receded too far for even the great
telescopes like the Yerkes 40-inch refractor to pick it up any more, and
forthcoming observations from strange places could be added at any point in
<a name="[-56-]"><font color="red">[-56-]</font></a>
the final cycle.  The big problem was to allow for the close Earth approach,
which clearly must have perturbed the original path around the Sun that we
were approximating with the preliminary orbits.  Maxwell said, "This will be a
nice variation, since we will need to separate the influence of the Earth and
the Moon - so we can't use Comrie." Who was Comrie?

<p>

"Comrie" turned out to be an oversized but thin purple volume called
"Planetary Coordinates", which contained the rectangular coordinates of all
the major planets for four decades, usually at 40-day intervals.  It was put
out by His Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office at Greenwich Observatory - where
my father later told me he had installed cabinets when he was a young
apprentice in 1904 England.

<p>

The author of this crucial tome was the director of the Almanac Office, Leslie
John Comrie, whom I regard as one of the giants of the strange computer trade.
He was a New Zealander by birth, and computer historians Down Under are now
proudly excavating his record.  He wasn't much of an astronomer, and Greenwich
was one of the great centers of the science - historically the fount of most
classical observation and calculation, proud of its association with Newton
and Halley, home of the Astronomer Royal.  And Comrie was not at all a whiz
kid: not a Sagan, or even a Whipple.  What he was, was the inheritor and last
monarch of the kingdom of mathematical table making.  The work of the national
almanac offices - Greenwich and Washington and Paris, and the German and
Russian and even Argentinian equivalents - was all calculation and
table-making; the observational work was done by others.  He was the top, and
at the top.

<p>

Maxwell explained this over the first months of our association.  Comrie was
"not an orbit man," but he and his people, and to a lesser extent their
American opposite numbers, furnished all sorts of tools without which orbit
computing would have been almost impossible.  Even today, with Crays popping
up in every corner and more orbit experts in NASA (let alone DOD, and Europe
and Japan, and Russia and China) than in all human history up to Sputnik, the
almanac offices produce the fundamental numbers.  Their calculations, which in
the Thirties were accepted as the most intricate in human experience, now
occupy less than the full capacity of a supermini.  As Galileo said, things
sure do move!

<p>

Since the purple masterpiece tabulated, not the position of the Earth, but the
position of the center of gravity of the Earth-Moon combination, Maxwell had
to work out new ways of using other data from the ephemerides - the annual
compendia of astronomical positions which were the main output of the almanac
offices - to get the positions of the Earth and Moon separately, and relate
those to the figures in "Comrie." I was deeply immersed.

<p>

From our best unperturbed orbit we calculated the approximate coordinates of
1936 CA; from the newly produced coordinates of the Earth and Moon we
calculated their influences on the asteroid (even though the little rock had
come within a million miles or so of us, the pull of the Sun was very much
greater).  Allowing for these perturbing forces, we recalculated the basic
constants of the asteroid orbit.  The idea, of course, was to keep track of
the object and pick it up several revolutions later, if it came close again.
Nobody except a few weirdos who read science fiction [ahem!] were yet doing
Lucifer's
<a name="[-57-]"><font color="red">[-57-]</font></a>
Hammer; the idea was to more closely determine the scale of the
solar system (now done directly using radar and laser measurements) by
triangulation of close approaches.

<p>

Before I get back to Comrie and such, I have to say that we lost the little
planetoid.  All the efforts since 1936, when Maxwell and I put out our major
publication (my first), which have featured much more elaborate perturbations
and used modern computers, have failed to predict a recovery.  There is now a
family name, the Apollo Group, for asteroids that come as close to the Sun as
the Earth does, and 1936 CA, permanently christened Adonis by the discoverer,
was the attention-getting member of that family.  Delporte found 213 other
minor planets, but Adonis was his masterpiece.

<p>

In addition to many volumes of mathematical tables, culminating in a
two-volume set of six-figure material published proudly by Chambers, and all
the astronomical and navigational tables from Greenwich, Comrie kept up a
remarkable flow of methodology papers in a wide variety of British
publications.  As an extreme example, he even made suggestions on how to do
optical ray tracing, some of which I incorporated into my own efforts during
the war.

<p>

He refined the use of hand-cranked Brunsviga desk calculators, including
unusual variants like a model with two setting barrels that did Ax and Bx when
you cranked in x (or even, with a reverse gear, -Bx!).  He explored the use of
enormous multi-register bookkeeping machines for differencing columns of
figures, or to build up and print tables from higher order differences; the
ugly term was "cross-footing," which hung on in IBM manuals until the early
Fifties - in fact, until IBM quit painting the old clunkers black.  In all
this, his concern was to use the exactly optimum devices, mathematical and
mechanical, for a given task; he was undoubtedly the culmination of his race,
and the best we will ever see: a very Tyrannosaurus Rex of non-automatic
computing.  Yes, the breed is extinct.

<p>

But the reason I think so very highly of him is not his stubborn precision,
not his expertise in using old- fashioned machinery, but the exact opposite:
his vision, his appreciation of novelty.  You have to remember that to use a
two hundred pound key-driven bookkeeping machine was innovative, in the
Twenties.  To find optimum devices he had to try new things, and sometimes
overshoot.  I suppose he encountered more resistance in his (by today's
standards) narrow world than Gene Amdahl or Bob Noyce did, in the fantasy
universe of microtechnology.

<p>

Those clanking monsters, and the IBM Bank Proof Machine of the same era, were
the summit of non-automatic information technology - that is, of computing
devices that required one human operator per machine.  Automatic machinery,
not necessarily electronic or even electrical, was being built by Jacquard at
the beginning and by Hollerith at the end of the nineteenth century.
Bookkeepers and their ilk, and later, statisticians, were exposed to its
power.  Comrie was the first astronomer, the first scientist in fact, to put
it to work.  Wallace Eckert, one of the heroes of my first chapter, who was in
a dozen ways Comrie's opposite number in the U.S., acknowledges his enterprise
repeatedly.

<p>

In 1928 Comrie published his experiences in using punched card ["Hollerith"]
equipment for table making, and in 1930 he dug down into His
<a name="[-58-]"><font color="red">[-58-]</font></a>
Majesty's shallow purse and rented a set of machines for the Almanac Office.
His young ladies punched up the fantastically complicated double- and
triple-entry tables of the motion of the Moon, due to E.W.  Brown of Yale
(Dirk Brouwer, who drew me to Harvard in 1940, was Brown's successor).  The
systems design, to use modern terminology, must have been extraordinary.  But
that was only the beginning; he then made up a punched card for each date for
which he wanted a lunar position - every few hours for several decades - and
ran the huge pack through step after step after step of intricate multivariate
interpolations.  There were problems with checking: the results had to be
perfect, not only for the astronomers around the world who would use them for
the rest of the century, but because lives depended on the navigating tables
which were distilled from the Greenwich data.

<p>

After many months of the most detailed and demanding effort, the task was done
- and Comrie promptly returned the machines to British Tab; he could not
justify keeping them for the other work of the office.  He published the story
in the major British astronomy journal, to which his eminence gave him access
(it was not exactly ordinary 1932 research material).  It was read bemusedly
by the old-timers (which I have to admit included Maxwell), enthusiastically
by a young Yale graduate student named Wallace Eckert, and in 1938 by an even
younger undergraduate at Michigan whose fingers were coupled to a very
non-automatic Marchant!

<p>

You will meet Comrie again a little later, when the computer revolution was
noticeably under way, and when he was honored in the U.S.  But let me go on to
another publication which enthused that Michigan student.  It was a book
called "Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation," and it was announced
in the American astronomical journals as I got ready for my second Harvard
summer.

<p>

It has recently been reprinted by the MIT Press as the fifth of the Charles
Babbage Institute series on the history of computing.  I have done a review
which recalled its bright orange 1940 cover and labeled it "the second
signpost I encountered on the computer road" - the road of the user (the first
signpost was the 1932 Comrie article, of course).  Even with a dull cover, it
makes remarkable reading.

<p>

The author was Wallace Eckert, and it is now time to identify him more
completely.  He was the second man to strongly influence my career, although
by the time I went to work for him in 1945 I had my rudder welded firmly in
place.  It was his book, and what I saw of his work at the Naval Observatory,
that had the real effect.  Those two things, and my excitement about Comrie's
experiments, weaned me away from Maxwell's conservatism and steered me toward
punched cards and the automation of computing processes.  When the little man
from the Manhattan District came for me, I was ready!

<p>

Eckert was a graduate student under Brown at Yale.  As I intended under
Maxwell to become an old-fashioned orbit computer, so he intended to become
an old-fashioned celestial mechanics researcher.  He was intimately acquainted
with the lunar tables when Comrie was mechanizing them, knew the details of
the work at Greenwich before final publication, and like me in Ann Arbor
dreamed of mechanizing the arduous calculations of classical astronomy - but
dreamed of it five or six years before I did.

<p>

<a name="[-59-]"><font color="red">[-59-]</font></a>

As I later went off to the Naval Observatory before finishing my doctorate, so
Eckert went off early to Columbia.  He got his degree somewhat before the
Comrie article came out, however, and was ensconced in Academe before the
Depression struck - and it was less severe in New York than in Detroit.  Even
so, he saw clearly that a good set of punched card equipment would be far too
expensive for the Columbia astronomy department.

<p>

Across campus, in the famous but much less purist Teacher's College, Eckert
observed a statistical research set-up featuring a slightly modified IBM
tabulator (a ton of gears, electro-mechanical counters and circuit breakers
driven by a big motor).  The proud "owner" was a Ben Wood, who had benefitted
from an early dose of Watsonian foresight, or charity (or both).  T.J.  was an
extremely influential Columbia trustee, with direct lines in to the equally
famous Columbia president, Nicholas Miraculous [Nicholas Murray Butler].

<p>

Eckert enlisted the support not only of his department and the eminent
Nicholas but of the American Astronomical Society, and approached The Great
Man - the first of many, many times he got to sit outside Mr. Watson's busy
office.  The result was the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau I
have already mentioned.  The work Eckert did there, considerably more advanced
than the huge job Comrie had done at Greenwich, culminated in the publication
of the Orange Opus.

<p>

Where Comrie used standard British machines, and Ben Wood had only a somewhat
improved giant adding-subtracting tabulator, Eckert obtained from the IBM
laboratories a multiplying punch with added sequencing capabilities.  He
could change the plugboard without changing plugboards, so to speak.  And with
it, making my mouth almost literally water as I read, he was able to integrate
an asteroid orbit just as I was manually integrating my Jupiter VIII orbit.
The details are excruciating, and even at that Eckert left out how he had to
use a clothespin on the end of a stick to extend his reach!

<p>

He probably couldn't do a time step much faster than I could on Maxwell's
Marchant, and I didn't need a clothespin.  If you worked out in detail, as
Comrie would have done, how much it was costing (including commercial rates
for the IBM machines), my stuff was probably five times cheaper.  But using
the machines was fun, at least for a while, and people like Comrie and Eckert
and Grosch and of course McPherson - and, remarkably, Watson himself -
expected newer and more powerful machines every year.  A better desk
calculator might reduce my cycle in Ann Arbor from twenty minutes to fifteen;
better IBM equipment would reduce Eckert's cycle from ten minutes to less than
a second (on the SSEC, in six or seven years), and to a few microseconds
today.

<p>

About the time the Orange Opus appeared, a wider door opened for Eckert.
Those ephemerides that all the national almanac offices published were what
astronomers and geodetic surveyors used.  But each year the astronomical
product was transmuted into a navigational volume, called in Britain and the
U.S.  the Nautical Almanac.  The data was for fewer objects, and given less
accurately, but for more closely spaced dates and times, so that it could be
extracted easily by gnarled fishing boat skippers who used marine
<a name="[-60-]"><font color="red">[-60-]</font></a>
sextants rather than meridian circles.  It obviously needed to be more easily
readable and useable.

<p>

The human computers and calculating machines to do this were in place.  But
the humans were in short supply; each year some astronomical work had to be
deferred because there weren't enough people to do everything.  This was
partly money; the Civil Service could have scraped up more Victors and
conceivably even, more Grosches, if budgets permitted - but not overnight.

<p>

For some years the military had wanted the Almanac Office at the Naval
Observatory to produce a third book, an Air Almanac, for the special needs of
primitive aerial navigation.  Bubble sextants, hence less accuracy; cockpits
instead of pilot houses, hence even simpler user facilities (today we would
say "very user friendly"); only a few stars, and the brightest planets; three
or four slim volumes a year, instead of an annual one.

<p>

The money had not been forthcoming.  Now the war was upon them; bombers were
being ferried across oceans; they anticipated long over-water or over-cloud
military missions.  Money was available at last, but there was no time - and
no more trained people.  You couldn't reassign the ephemeris personnel, or
there would be no fundamental data to boil down.  You needed the marine book
more urgently than ever.

<p>

The senior astronomers, and most of the computing staff in the Almanac Office,
knew about Comrie and Eckert and their machine successes.  An approach was
made.  Could the young Columbia professor put aside his academic career, and
his IBM-sponsored laboratory, and come down to Washington?  At the same time,
the Navy told IBM of its problem, and asked for a quick and sophisticated
response.  It came together quickly; IBM would rent the Observatory an
assortment of its best machines, and make sure that exceptional customer
engineer service was provided; Eckert would become the director of the Almanac
Office, the equivalent of Chief Scientist today; a small cadre of operating
personnel would be hired.  The Air Almanac would have top priority, with other
work to be transferred to the IBM machines when opportunity offered.

<p>

Eckert left the Columbia astronomical bureau in the hands of his capable
assistant, Lillian Feinstein Hausman.  To run the machines at the Naval
Observatory - and he understood he would be far too busy to do it himself - he
and Lillian looked around New York, and recruited a youngster from the
cloak-and-suit arena.  He knew all about punched cards, a lot about IBM, and
nothing whatsoever about astronomy.  His name was Jack Belzer.

<p>

The installation was under a full head of steam when I arrived, eight or ten
months later.  I tried to get the powers that were - not the Secretary of the
Navy, for sure, but senior people at the Naval Observatory whose names I knew
- to assign me to the almanac operation.  I had no advance knowledge of
Belzer's shop, unfortunately; the notices of Eckert's apotheosis had carefully
not emphasized the novelty or given details of the appointment, although
Maxwell and I had nodded sagely to each other and said "punched cards."  I
wrote Eckert, with whom I had had no earlier direct contact, and a Dr. H.R.
Morgan, head of the fundamental meridian circle work and of the internal
scientific council which advised the superintendent (a Navy captain of
absolutely no distinction, named Hellweg).

<p>
<a name="[-61-]"><font color="red">[-61-]</font></a>
Eckert replied that there were no vacancies in the Almanac Office - true, in
the sense of authorized Civil Service openings, in spite of the military
urgencies building up at every scientific institution in the government.  In a
later chapter I will tell how the same sort of bureaucratism got in Wernher
von Braun's way in 1957, when the race to orbit a satellite was heating up.

<p>

Morgan told me I would be assigned at first to the Equatorial Division, but
that in view of my interest and advanced training in "theoretical"
[computational] astronomy the observatory would try to move me over to
Eckert's shop "in the future" - that is, when an Assistant Astronomer slot
opened up.  He then went on to detail the skimpy arrangements for my actual
arrival - no travel or relocation expenses in 1941!

<p>

I was to share an office in a small, rather new building with John Willis.
John was an old hand in the Equatorial Division, and sort of in charge of the
unpopular Ritchey-Chr?tien reflector (not much of an observing program, and
hence not much observing).  He did little computing - just what was required
to reduce the measurements he made of the strange circular photographic
plates.  I was therefore allowed prime custody of "our" calculator, which was
by a considerable margin the funniest (in both senses of the adjective) I had
ever used.

<p>

It was a Millionaire, made before the turn of the century in Germany, and
examples survive today in collections and museums.  It had a gear shift.  You
cranked a non-ergonomic handle once, while with your left hand you selected
one of ten multiplier digits.  Clank! Crunch! And the carriage moved to the
left, ready for your next assault.  But that wasn't all.  I had seen such a
machine already, perhaps at Harvard.  This one, though, was motorized!

<p>

Some crazed mechanic, probably from the observatory instrument shop, had slung
a ten-pound electric motor underneath, and provided a leather belt up to "the
works." There was a neat pushbutton on the top of the crank, and the latter
could still be worked by muscle power when the belt broke - which was
frequently!

<p>

I couldn't believe even Captain Hellweg would want me to live with such a
beast, let alone finish my thesis calculations on it.  But Willis assured me
he preferred it to the little Brunsvigas that others in the building used,
although he mentioned wistfully that "the Almanac people" - those who didn't
prefer logarithms - had Marchants and Fridens.  I reported all this to
Dorothy, who was suitably sympathetic, but busy arranging to come East and
marry me.  She wrote that she was sure she could learn to operate it for me in
the long evenings when I would be writing my thesis.  I obviously was
acquiring a helpmeet as well as a bedmate.

<p>

My Millionaire pangs were intensified by what I found across the hall.
Because of space limitations in the Main Building, and I suspect also because
Eckert was wary of complaints about the noise and heat of the heavier IBM
machines, Belzer and his equipment - and, aha! two handsome young ladies - had
been put out of the way in my building.  I had had only glimpses of the stuff
before, and the pictures in Eckert's Orange Opus didn't do it justice.  The
machines, and especially the big 405 tabulator, were huge.  They were
obviously expensive (although I now found out from Jack that they were only
<a name="[-62-]"><font color="red">[-62-]</font></a>
rented, never sold).  They were noisy --even the key punch and verifier, which
the more nubile of the young ladies operated.

<p>

Eckert had a 601 multiplying punch on order (without the special features of
his Columbia machine), and the usual sorter, reproducer, interpreter and
collator.  There may well have been a gang punch attached to the 405, by which
accumulated totals could be entered into blank cards.  There will be more
about these fascinating - to me - black boxes later.  The important thing for
history buffs is that this was the very first permanent IBM installation in
the whole world to pay regular rent and do scientific work.  Comrie's
Greenwich effort had not been permanent.  Eckert's shop on top of Pupin in New
York had been one of Watson's many benefactions.  There were places all over
the world doing fancy statistical work, up to and including actuarial
calculations, which were as complicated as what Belzer was doing (although not
up to the Comrie and Eckert-Orange-Opus level).  But this adventure was
unique; I understood that clearly.  And I could go across the hall several
times a day and watch.

<p>

Eckert had a special challenge, and Jack a different but also very important
one.  Eckert's solution remains a landmark - a completely forgotten landmark.
Belzer's efforts were writ on water, but amusing to recall, in a day of page
description languages and desktop laser printers.  Eckert's Air Almanac was
even more demanding than its astronomical and marine-navigational relatives,
as regards errors.  An error in astronomical data would set back a research
program, and waste time and money.  An error in nautical data was
life-threatening; the ship might be wrecked if its position turned out to be
in error.  But the tempo was slow, and the sea floated the customer with
relative safety.

<p>

In the air, things were much tougher.  A navigational error meant running out
of fuel, or missing a vital landing spot.  And the book would have to be used
under dreadful conditions - a tiny cockpit, poor lighting, heavy turbulence.
Things happened fast.

<p>

The men and women who planned the book before Eckert and Belzer arrived did
their very best to make it user friendly - simple to use, and fast besides.
Belzer was responsible for making it readable.  Eckert was to figure out how
to make every single digit correct, and he did so.  Decades later the Almanac
Office could say that not one error had ever been detected in any copy of the
hundreds of volumes, tens of thousands of pages, tens of millions of digits,
of the Air Almanac.  True, cynics like me pointed out that those aviators who
found errors never came back to report them!  But the claim was undoubtedly
valid.

<p>

There had long been a tradition of perfection in the computations.  Whether
done by logarithms, by desk calculators, or (later) by automatic equipment or
modern computers, techniques like duplication, with great care not to
replicate errors - ah there, Maxwell - and every kind of differencing and
consistency checking, made the numbers unexceptionable.  But to turn these
values into mass printings - that was the rub.  Obviously they could be set in
type, and the plates made photographically from the masters would be perfect,
except for deterioration which careful printers would catch.  All that
<a name="[-63-]"><font color="red">[-63-]</font></a>
had
been in train for many years.  But how did you make sure the masters were
correct? Proofreading: dull, dull, dull - and error-prone.

<p>

The most senior and valuable men and women in the Almanac Office did it.
Juniors, and clerks and such, simply could not be trusted to not overlook that
one incorrect digit in a sea of figures.  There were attempts to cross-check;
sheets drawn from the master plates were differenced by hand, or at Greenwich
on Comrie's bookkeeping monsters.  And that gave Eckert his clue.

<p>

Sheets pulled from the production plates, the actual plates from which the
tables would be printed, were given to Jack's keypuncher.  Without having the
faintest idea what the numbers meant - and that was good, not bad - she
punched them onto IBM cards.  When Jack had done his job (we haven't gotten to
that yet) the sheets that were photographed had been made from another set of
punched cards.  The set that young Rubye made was compared with the older set,
in a conventional IBM 513 reproducer.  <i>Ecco</i>!  Completely mechanized
proofreading, and by inexpensive and draft-proof help!

<p>

In the early stages of the installation, that set of cards from which the
plates were made was punched up from the handwritten numbers sent over from
the main office.  As production neared, however, much of the subtabulation of
the marine and astronomical data was being done on the IBM equipment - and all
of the work would be transferred when the multiplying punch was checked out
and in daily use.  Over many years the interface with astronomy would move
upstream, so that less and less data (and more and more program material)
would be key-entered.

<p>

This triumph over human proofreading drudgery and fallibility was complete
when I arrived in May [1941], but Jack was in the very middle of his struggle.
Eckert had charged him with producing the master sheets that were to be
photographed, on the IBM tabulator.  Sounds easy: wire the plugboard; feed the
cards in; tear off the pages neatly.  Check once in a while to make sure the
type is clean.  But there were a million little glitches.

<p>

He and Eckert, and the printers, had had to choose very special paper and work
out the forms (very light blue ink), and then persuade some overworked
Washington forms manufacturer to produce them, and with better-than-normal
precision.  It may well have been IBM itself, which had a card plant in the
vicinity - I never knew.  Then the forms had to track nicely through the 405,
which was new but not perfect, The single-use ribbon, also carefully chosen,
had to be monitored almost continually; a slip on the last line meant an
hour's work to be done over.  Experiment had already shown it was not
practical to splice or patch or correct the sheets.

<p>

But there was worse, much worse.  To solve major problems of formatting and
presentation, and in view of the photographic reduction that was needed to
make pretty pages, a narrower type style was absolutely necessary.  And even
for Eckert, even for the world's first whatsit, and even for Our Brave
Aviators, IBM could not rebuild the typebars and the printer unit on its 405.
It would have cost the earth, and there wasn't time.  What they did do was
accept an order from Eckert for a special printing device to be delivered a
year or two up the line - and of course Pearl Harbor intervened - and propose
a crazy interim solution, which Jack was trying to make work when I arrived.

<p>

IBM put narrow-face slugs in the standard-width type bars, which went
<a name="[-64-]"><font color="red">[-64-]</font></a>
up and
down 150 times a minute for numerical output.  They provided a one-of-a-kind
platen adjustment which moved the platen and the paper half a typebar width
laterally by manual intervention.  Jack and the customer engineer and the
less-nubile young lady ran the input deck of cards into the feed and printed
every other column.  Then they collectively held their breaths, and the
customer engineer rolled the paper back [!!!] and moved the platen over.  A
switch changed the columns being read from the cards, the deck was run again,
and the missing columns filled in.  Today we would say, "You've GOT to be
kidding!"

<p>

The whole unnatural process revolved around the customer engineer, who had to
be ultra-precise and superhumanly patient.  IBM had supplied one, as promised.
He was Richard Bennett, a quiet but attractive man in his late twenties.  To
the chagrin of Jack's young ladies, he was married, but this did not keep the
draft off his neck; after Pearl Harbor and its follow-ons, and after the
arrival of Eckert's table printer, I suppose (I was off into optical
adventures by then), they took him away.

<p>

IBM had a policy, mistaken in my opinion, of never requesting deferment for
its customer engineers, its manufacturing people, or its engineering staff.
In some cases a military agency might do so directly - I've always assumed
that was what happened in my own case in 1945.  More frequently the dragnet,
warned of the great value of a trained maintenance man, what with the hundreds
of important punched card installations everywhere in the American military
environment, captured guys like Bennett as they entered the system.

<p>

IBM - or Watson himself, more likely - thought poorly of these youngsters
doing the same job they had been doing in civilian life, at a fraction of the
pay and without the comforts.  Also, like Dick, many of them had families: in
The Old Man's view, these, and the families of IBM men in combat, were valued
parts of the extended IBM family.  So the company, uniquely in the country I
think, made substantial supplementary payments to ease the pain.  And, as you
will see later, it made careful provision to re- absorb the men after the war.

<p>

About that table printer: unlike much of the Belzer/Bennett effort (writ on
water, I said), there are two or three articles about it in the remote and
scanty literature of the time.  Eckert was rightly quite proud of it, and told
me years later that several copies had been made for other almanac offices and
similar institutions.  It was a black proportional spacing electric
typewriter, which IBM had just begun to make in the Forties, in which most of
the alphabetic characters had been replaced by extra numerical fonts: bold
face, or small size, or small-size subscripts and superscripts; all designed
to be harmonious.

<p>

Automatic spacing was crippled, and put instead under external control.  This
was embodied in a (black) key punch, which read the stack of data cards,
rather slowly of course.  On such punches there was a rack for a master card,
which rode back and forth in synchronism with the detail card.  IBM had
modified the circuits so that the holes punched in the master card now
controlled the spacing of the typewriter.  Belzer's shop also supplied other
material and controls on the detail (data) cards.

<p>

The results were extremely elegant, and the Air Almanacs and marine
<a name="[-65-]"><font color="red">[-65-]</font></a>
versions printed with the device for decades were also much more readable.  It
was my knowledge of this antique but extremely successful accomplishment,
along with a hundred adjurations from my hero Comrie, that made me such a
grouch about character reading standards (MICR and OCR) in later years.

<p>

I told the stories earlier about how I left the Naval Observatory in 1942 for
war work, and how Eckert was called away in 1945 by IBM to start the Watson
Lab.  And I have mentioned that Maxwell served there unhappily for a year or
two.  The Observatory was a seedbed for computational innovation in a way that
Comrie could not duplicate.  This was partly due to the different kinds of war
pressure; Greenwich was seriously bombed, while life went on very quietly
indeed at the U.S. Naval Observatory.  It was also due to the fruitful
relationship between Wallace Eckert and The Great Watson.

<p>

If I may drop back into autobiography for a few lines, I can fill in about a
very warm and productive marriage.  Dorothy was delighted with my telegram
from the Navy (even at that crucial moment, by the way, I wrote rather than
telephoned - ah, 1941!).  She immediately began planning to come East and join
me, and we agreed to marry in Washington, and without family; both sides were
very short of money, the seniors as well as the Happy Couple.  There were
showers and feminine festivities in Pasadena, and Dorothy also had to help her
bosses find a replacement.

<p>

It was more a mark of the times than of my, um, overbearing nature that we
assumed she would help me with my astronomical career rather than attempt to
keep her own going.  She had had one Mount Wilson publication, but she
regarded herself as an assistant to the Hubbles and Humasons and Dunhams and
Nicholsons, rather than as a junior aspirant.  The war made a difference, of
course, but the attitude remained.

<p>

My parents were a little dubious about my leaving Michigan, but in their usual
supportive fashion promised me the family Plymouth - then pushing 75,000 miles
but in excellent shape - as our wedding present.  I resigned my last
fellowship (only two months remained), shook hand with Maxwell fondly - we
both knew it would never be the same again, but even the most ardent disciple
has to go on the road in the end - and moved six years of belongings back to
Royal Oak.  Sorting furiously, I packed all the technical stuff and most of
the personal - bye bye, bicycle - into the Plymouth and took off for
Washington.  There were no interstates or autoroutes; it was a long drive.

<p>

I found a temporary basement studio apartment near the Swiss Embassy, and on
nice days could walk to the Observatory.  I had been unable to have a car in
Ann Arbor; I could not afford one, of course, but also university regulations
prohibited - an excellent leveller, but difficult on today's overextended
campuses.  By the time Dorothy arrived - to stay chastely at the University
Women's Club; it was a different time! - I had found a new but very small
unfurnished apartment (with a suitable closet, it later turned out, for our
foldboat - but no garage).

<p>

We shopped frantically for furniture, had dinner one night with our nice
witnesses, and tied the knot in minimum Lutheran style.  We could not afford a
honeymoon.  However, just as I always managed to buy new textbooks in my
<a name="[-66-]"><font color="red">[-66-]</font></a>
darkest Ann Arbor poverty, so I managed a platinum wedding ring for Dorothy!

<p>

Things went very well indeed, although the fine frenzy and the steamed-up
windows of the Altadena orange groves did not recur.  Indeed, one of our more
promising sexual experiments one Sunday afternoon was interrupted by the radio
announcing Pearl Harbor, and Dorothy worried for several years whether a
wrathful Swedish Lutheran deity had not disapproved of her waywardness!

<p>

She indeed learned to run the Millionaire, with and without motor.  She was
welcome at the Observatory until Pearl Harbor, after which the inimitable
Hellweg made it off limits.  She typed my thesis, on a rented - yes, black! -
typewriter.  She waved me off on my first overnight train ride, back to Ann
Arbor for my orals, and insisted I have a berth to be fresh for the ordeal.

<p>

She came proudly with me to Commencement, and was the first one after Maxwell
to call me "Dr.  Grosch" - and kissed me besides! The war consumed us; she had
only gotten time off to come with me through the intervention of her new boss
Dr. Meggers.  The uranium was throbbing in the spectrograph, so to speak.  But
with all the troubles of the time, we were beginning a good marriage.

The looping around is now almost done.  To draw you in to an exciting time,
and to introduce you to some rather spectacular actors "early on", as the
Brits say, the narrative was decidedly non-lineal.  To disentangle it,
re-order the chapters: 04, "Three Years Ahead Of Myself", was boyhood.  Then
came college, and Maxwell made a computer of me in 05, "2500 Hours On A
Marchant."  I spent a Harvard summer and a Pasadena Christmas, and got a wife
and a job, in 06, "Mate In Two Moves."  The war and the doctorate arrived in
07, "Comrie, Eckert, And A Jack Belzer."  Dorothy and I did war work in 02,
"In A Glass Darkly," and I was drafted to work at IBM in 03, "A Little Man
From The Manhattan District."

<p>

Then there was a gap; things that happened a year or two later are described
in the first chapter, "Watson In All His Glory," but the transition from von
Neumann, and Los Alamos and The Bomb, to relatively peaceful late-Forties IBM,
is missing.  I'll tell that story now, and when this chapter is done we will
jointly be on a non-tangled course - from the Watson Lab days well after the
unveiling of IBM's first electronic giant, the SSEC, to the day sixty years
later when I finish this book.

<p>

The crates of equipment, and that big safe, and the first Giant Brains Of Los
Alamos, all came to the tenth floor of the Pupin physics building at the north
end of the Columbia campus.  In the whirl of getting going, I hardly noticed
the relationship to the parent IBM - "590", as I soon learned to call it.
Eckert was luxuriating in the familiar and welcoming embrace of his old
university and department and friends, which he had missed greatly at the
Naval Observatory, and he drew me in to the circle from the beginning.  It
wasn't necessary; he could have left me outside the door.  But I was a fellow
astronomer, and had all the other academic credentials, and he wanted me to
help him do more at Columbia than what he had time for personally - cooperate
in teaching and research, and in nurturing bright youngsters.

<p>

He wanted to spread the gospel of mechanized computation, not to make money
for IBM, or even to thank The Old Man for his long and substantial support,
but because he believed in it and wanted to help others to see the light.  He
saw me as a fellow preacher.  Little did he dream that the little sect he and
I were helping found would throw off a torrent of machines and languages, a
worldwide glossolalia with Fifth Generation Japanese and born-again
spreadsheeters rolling in the aisles and masticating the carpets!

<p>

He put me up for the Men's Faculty Club - yes, there was a Women's next
<a name="[-70-]"><font color="red">[-70-]</font></a>
door, not nearly so well equipped.  I began eating lunch nearly every day at
the informally arranged round tables.  There were famous scientists
everywhere, and humanists as well.  There were men interested in both sides
like Selig Hecht, whose work in the mechanism of color vision I knew from
optical references, and Harold Urey the Nobel chemist, who shared a bloody
field with me at Cal Tech fourteen years later, and Maurice Ewing the
oceanographer.  And across the room, once, Einstein.

<p>

We astronomers ate part of the time with the physicists, and part with the
mathematicians.  The latter were pretty pure, and getting purer as the war
wound down; Eckert and I were both more comfortable with the former, and I
noticed that Jan Schilt, who had succeeded Eckert some years back as head of
the astronomy department, was also more at ease with the physicists.  Jan was
in some ethereal sense also my boss, since I had without even asking been made
an associate of his department (Eckert was reassimilated as a professor,
although like me without salary).

<p>

As I have said, Wallace quickly cast out a net for Rex Seeber, and rescued him
from Howard Aiken and the horrors of umpteen-decimal-place Bessel functions,
which the Navy was calculating with the help - I have always assumed, the
reluctant help - of Grace Hopper.  My opinion of the Harvard computations was
shared by Comrie, I found out rather quickly; Eckert also thought them a waste
but didn't worry much about it.  Rex was more at ease with the IBMers downtown
and was soon swept away by Hamilton's SSEC project, so we didn't see much of
him at the Faculty Club.

<p>

Before the Watson Lab left Pupin for its mid-life home on 116th Street, Eckert
came to me about another prospect.  He had had his name from Higher Authority
- I assumed IBM, which was silly of me; I realized years later it must have
been von Neumann, who had a finger in nearly every erudite pot in the war
effort.  This was Hilleth Thomas, a world-famous but exceedingly unworldly
theoretical physicist who had been doing interior ballistics - that is,
explosions and such, as distinguished from exterior, which was trajectories,
and which astronomers and ENIACs worked on.  He had been a user of the
Aberdeen punched card computing shop, which is why I thought "IBM", but it
turned out Great Johnnie had scrimmaged on that playing field also, and at
Aberdeen.

<p>

Thomas, who had a doctorate from Trinity, Cambridge - the best of all the
great prewar scientific colleges in England - had been teaching in the late
Thirties at Ohio State.  <i>Mirabile dictu</i>! a Welsh fish in midwestern
shallows.
As a member of the regional astronomy Neighbors' Club, which he often
attended, I had met him in Columbus and recognized his great applied
mathematical skills.  I told Wallace he would be a real catch, and after
checking around with our luncheon companions Eckert made him a bewildered
IBMer - the company's third scientist.  He fit as perfectly into the Columbia
ambiance as Wallace, and was a valued member of the physics table from his
first luncheon.  Sartorially he fitted as poorly at 590 as I, but at least he
had no hair on his face!

<p>

Eckert had a good relationship with I.I. Rabi, who was still senior man in the
Columbia Physics Department, although seconded to the MIT radar laboratory as
Number Two to the director, Lee DuBridge.  When Rabi returned
<a name="[-71-]"><font color="red">[-71-]</font></a>
in late 1945, he saw that Thomas was given professorial status.  I believe
Hilleth had had tenure at Ohio State, but since access to normal academic
advancement on Morningside Heights was not a problem for those of us drawing
IBM salaries, it didn't really matter.  He was the first of the Watson Lab
staff to acquire a doctoral candidate: Robert Jastrow, now a major warrior on
the space publicity and government grant battlefields, but then only an
overbearing graduate student, contemptuous of us plugboard wirers.  He came
too late to meet Feynman!

<p>

Wheels ground swiftly, down at 590.  Watson wanted a handsome presence at
Columbia for his new Pure Science Department and its Watson Scientific
Computing Laboratory.  While I was leaping around like a trout on a hook in
Pupin, Eckert was drawn in to real estate negotiations downtown.  T.J. had
found out that a small fraternity had owned an interesting building adjacent
to the main Columbia campus: 612 West 116th Street.  The building was vacant;
the young men were serving elsewhere - many of them in the Pacific.  Orders
came down to buy it, refurbish it for IBM occupancy, and then transfer it to
Columbia ownership.  I'm sure those subterranean beancounters at World
Headquarters made sure proper tax advantage was taken, but I knew nothing
about such matters, nor I suspect did Wallace.

<p>

I was swiftly drawn into the planning, which was complicated.  The building
was only twenty-five feet wide, wedged in between two large apartment
buildings.
Aside from one very small light well, the only windows were at the front
(north) and the back.  There was a small rear yard which was never used, but
which guaranteed a little breeze; there was of course no air conditioning.

<p>

There were five above-grade stories, and two basements.  One of these, as was
common in such structures, was only slightly down from the street and had a
separate direct entrance under the formal front steps, and a rather large
front light well.  The most serious problem for a computing shop was access;
there was no elevator, nor any sensible way of installing one.  In the event,
heavy equipment had to be brought in through the front lobby
for the first floor, over iron railings and through large French doors into
the library for the second floor, and down through that awkward light well for
the upper basement - or, theoretically, through alleys and the back yard, but
we never had to do that while I was in charge.

<p>

The stairwell was rebuilt to fire-resistant commercial standards; there was no
other vertical trafficway - no back stairs.  The kitchen and dining facilities
were torn out, and in the process steel I-beams were put in to support my
heavy equipment (false floors, which T.J. insisted on at the SSEC, were never
even considered).  Heavy wiring, entirely different from what the fraternity
boys had needed, was installed.

<p>

There was an amusing problem with the toilets.  First the architect tried to
put two toilets on each major floor, on the side lightwell: much too wasteful
of space.  The unisex arrangements of Europe and of small retail
establishments were out of the question for staid IBM.  I said, "Male in the
first basement, female on One for visitors and a receptionist; male again on
Two, female on Three, male on Four.  There are gonna be guys on Five and in
the sub-basement, but they can hoof it."

<p>

Alas for rationality, after the building was done, and as we were moving
<a name="[-72-]"><font color="red">[-72-]</font></a>
in [1946], an alarmed minor IBM vice president noted that Dr.  Eckert (on
Three) would be <i>hors concours</i>.  Additions were made: urinals and
sanitary
napkin dispensers, as required.  All the labels were switched.  But the
urinals were not taken out of the new Ladies, prompting one of my more
outspoken gals to say that she really appreciated the chance to examine one
closely for the first time!

<p>

The vice president concerned ended up at Diebold (Safe and Lock;
He-Didn't-Invent-The-Word John Diebold was still at Harvard).  Indignant
surviving IBM vice presidents have heard me tell this story and have denied
the culprit was, ah, eliminated because he juggled the johns, but my view is
that if that wasn't why they shipped him out, it ought to have been.

<p>

The living room of the fraternity house was converted into a lovely reception
room, featuring a lovely receptionist who wore lovely tight skirts, lovely
high heels, and ran a large and very unlovely switchboard - the kind with lots
of cords.  More about this room later; it was the scene of one of my greatest
triumphs.

<p>

In the waist of the building was a space for "special" machines.  Pete Luhn's
babies lived there first, and later a modified pencil-mark-reading IBM test
scoring machine.  Still later [1949] I put the prototype 604 there, and it was
still working away fourteen hours a day when I left.  Then came a Men's
(formerly Ladies), and the main machine room: full width, and about fifty feet
long.

<p>

On the floor below - we usually said "basement" - there was a spare room in
front, in which Richard Bennett (yes, the same wonderful customer engineer who
had made the Air Almanac printable in 1941 at the Naval Observatory; we will
celebrate his Watson Lab advent a little later) was to build an automatic
astronomical measuring engine for Eckert.  Then came a space for many, many
punched card file cabinets, and a restricted number of boxes of blank cards
(the main stock was in the sub-basement, along with my foldboat).

<p>

In back was the second machine room, also fifty feet long.  This was the
facility more frequented by our evening-working students and visitors, and the
WC immediately became genuinely unisex, even before the offending VP had
ceased to encumber us.

<p>

In the front of the sub-basement, which had a horrid access chute originally
intended to bring in coal, we planned a small machine shop.  This sounded
wonderful to me, although it was not for my outfit; I had had the run of an
experimental machine shop at Sperry, and enjoyed making little gadgets
(remember that foldboat in the storage area).  In the middle was a brand new
oil burner, procured with enormous 1946 difficulty by IBM to replace the coal
furnace.  And, miraculously, a walk-in vault for the fraternity silver or
whatever, whose door I promptly had renovated by a fancy locksmith so I could
store our Los Alamos material there.  When we moved in, I sent the giant Pupin
safe back to the Manhattan District.

<p>

Behind all this was a general storeroom.  There was no toilet, and the
machinist would theoretically have to climb to the main floor.  There was a
sink in the oil burner room, however.  I had had it installed for the janitor,
or so I said.

<p>

<a name="[-73-]"><font color="red">[-73-]</font></a>
There had been two sets of fireplaces, which the architect reluctantly
plugged.  The rear one left lovely mantelpieces in the two machine rooms (east
wall) and went on up to the fourth floor.  By no coincidence at all there was
a fireplace in my third floor office.  The more elaborate set began in the
measuring-engine room, flowered in the reception room and the beautiful
library on the second floor, became more conservative in Wallace's office on
Three, and terminated on Four.

<p>

The library was as large as the reception room below, which meant twenty-five
by
fifty feet.  I had it done with walnut shelving all around, to the height of
the mantelpiece.  To put at the front, where the French doors needed to be
kept free for equipment to be rigged in, I had Mary Noble find me a matched
pair of globes, terrestrial and celestial; big, expensive, handsome.  On top
of the shelf cabinetry were items from the IBM American Ceramics collection.

<p>

"Mary Noble" was Mary Noble Smith, in charge of the IBM art collections.  Her
successor in the Fifties, when T.J. put more emphasis on having museums inside
his empire, was called a curator, but Mary Noble had not attained that title.
For one thing, she did curtains and drapes as well, and furniture, at least
for 590 and places like the Endicott Homestead.  She appeared even before the
alterations on 116th Street were finished, and Wallace shot her over to me
with a sigh of relief; I was deeply interested, and he didn't care an iota.
He was concerned about books for the library, however, and first got The Old
Man's permission to buy some, and then solicited lists from his buddies in the
math and physics and statistics departments, which I gladly incorporated into
my own.

<p>

Mary Noble was in her late fifties, walked rather slowly with a cane, was
distressingly barrel-shaped.  But she had the proper connections all over New
York City to do her multi-faceted job, whether it was to find a huge, gorgeous
Oriental for the reception area or merely an ornate gold frame for the big
photograph of T.J. which naturally had to go over its fireplace.  And,
although perpetually harried, she was a nice person, and an eye-opener about
The Old Man and the inner reaches of IBM.  Mind you, IBM was only a $140
million a year company in 1945 - but it already had lots of inner reaches!

<p>

She came to me just after the move, and before there were books in the
library.  "Dr. Grosch," she said, "perhaps you can intercede with Dr. Eckert.
Mr. Watson (she seldom said `IBM', and never `T.J.') has a wonderful
collection of portraits of American scientists, and I have asked Dr. Eckert to
select some for the library, and his office.  There are twenty-five...".
"Good grief, Mary Noble," I broke in, "how did T.J. get so many? They aren't
all by the same painter, I hope?"

<p>

"Mr. Watson sponsored a competition for young portrait artists across the
country," she said, "and the judges picked these as the best.  Mr. Watson
bought the whole collection.  Remind me to tell you about our lovely ceramics
pieces; he did the same thing recently at Syracuse University, and I have the
forty-eight state prizewinners in our warehouse."

<p>

"Didn't Eckert like the paintings?"  "He didn't want to see them.  He just
looked at the list and said `We'll take him', and that was that."  "Who'd he
choose, Mary Noble?"

<p>

"It was a Willard Gibbs.  Do you know him?"  "Yep; the greatest American
<a name="[-74-]"><font color="red">[-74-]</font></a>
name in thermodynamics - and from Yale besides."  She didn't know about
Wallace's connections.

<p>

"Let me see your list."  Short pause.  "OK, we'll take Benjamin Franklin; he
was quite a natural philosopher even if not a full-time research man."  "But
Dr.  Grosch," she wailed, "how about all the others?"  "They're not
scientists, dear lady, and the boss obviously won't give `em house room."

<p>

She had Edison, and the Wright Brothers, and lots of other inventors.  I told
her to hang them on the walls of the Endicott engineering lab or in the
Education Building next door to it.  Mary Noble bristled a little - a very
little.  "Whom do you call a scientist, Doctor?"  "Oh, Isaac Newton, say."

<p>

Three weeks later the art van drove up and delivered a big oil painting of the
great Sir Isaac.  I had them hang it over the mantelpiece in the library, the
place of honor.  "Mary Noble, the Newton is just great.  I hung it over the
fireplace.  Where did you find it?"

<p>

"I had it painted for you," she said placidly.  As I said, <u>lots</u> of inner
reaches!

<p>

One of the curious customs in the IBM Empire in 1946, and for many years
thereafter - it probably survives in mutated form even today - was the
Portrait Kit.  Not to be confused with my Newton or Wallace's Gibbs, it was a
package of standard framed photographs of IBM executives which appeared
mysteriously whenever a new office opened, and even when someone was promoted
into physical surroundings where a current or appropriate-level package had
not landed.  Everybody got the standard Watson portrait, and a THINK sign; the
size and framing of The Old Man's picture of course varied with your
importance, or the importance of the new office.  Then in proportion, there
were portraits of other officers, and big shots in your own line.

<p>

Thus Hamilton had not only a large Watson Senior, an early Watson Junior, and
several other Olympians, but famous engineers Bryce and Lake and - very
naughty of him - a matching but non-standard one of Hollerith.  Eckert had a
very large Watson Senior over his mantelpiece, and a pile of THINK signs to
give to visitors, but hung the Other Faces out in the hallway.  The big Watson
in the reception area was carefully matted and elaborately framed by Mary
Noble, but nevertheless was the standard pose.  Some mysterious cubbyhole at
590 dispatched these kits all over the world (the French got
R?FL?CHISSEZ, with the proper acute accents; the Germans, DENKE).

<p>

Over my fireplace I had a handsome French post-Impressionist scene, offered by
Mary Noble from her Homestead stock - that is, out of the general IBM art
collection, from which paintings and sculptures and such were rotated through
the various IBM country clubs and guest houses.  I had elegant built-in
bookshelves (Thomas had such a mass of books the architect gave up, and let
him put in ceiling-high office shelving).  And we all had good W.&amp;
J. Sloane furniture, but only Eckert had a rug.

<p>

Oh, by careful scheming I had a Marchant - yes, the familiar Model ACT-10M -
on my side table, and made very good use of it.  The two machine rooms had
Fridens.  Wallace didn't need a calculator, and Hilleth used a slide rule or
looked sort of cross-eyed while, like von Neumann and Feynman, he did sums in
his head!

<p>

I've said that T.J. decided everything.  After we had been in business on
116th Street for a while, I asked the boss - I called him "Dr. E." - if I
might buy a printing calculator; that is, a fancier adding machine that would
do simple multiplications rather clumsily, but print on a tape.  In today's
world of TI and HP and Casio hand-helds you get that and a great deal more for
under fifty bucks; what I wanted was a Remington Rand machine that weighed
twenty pounds and cost four hundred 1947 dollars.  Eckert by this time was
alert to IBM customs and prejudices; he added my request to his list of things
to ask Mr.
<a name="[-75-]"><font color="red">[-75-]</font></a>
Watson.  The next time he got to sit outside the throneroom, and get inside -
the latter did not by any means always follow the former - he said that
someone at his place wanted to buy a RemRand adding machine.  The Old Man
looked at him sternly and said, "Buy an Underwood!"  Next item?

<p>

Usually I saw T.J. at a distance, or through the eyes of others.  There were
ceremonial handshakes, and receiving lines, and he would be paternal at the
IBM Children's Christmas party (where Santa Claus brought
<u>Mrs.&nbsp;Watson</u> the big
present, and the childless were relegated to the Waldorf balcony).  I remember
a spectacular dinner in the Hall of Stuffed Birds at the Museum of Natural
History - he was probably a director of that museum too - when he announced an
Arabic typewriter, and Dorothy got the giggles at the incongruities.

<p>

After The Bomb was dropped he wanted to celebrate the IBM contribution, and
incidentally to re-emphasize the recent creation of the Watson Lab.  He gave a
magnificent luncheon at the Waldorf, with General Groves (unfortunately) as
guest of honor, and with a curious mixture of science types and military men
and his personal friends.  No Oppenheimer.  Eckert had seen that invitations
went to von Neumann and the others at Los Alamos, but only a few came - I seem
to remember Bethe.

<p>

Eckert was at the head table, and I was also introduced.  But what I remember
is pure IBM - and because of the man involved, nice IBM.  For such a
gathering, with all that brass, even Watson had to have liquor.  The Waldorf,
for one of its most valued customers, dug `way down, and produced the best
Scotch and bourbon and such - this in the depths of rationing, and when gin
was made in Puerto Rico.  I was much impressed; it was my very first IBM
function, and I already looked forward to many more.

<p>

As I stood in the lively crowd, with a double manhattan and a handful of
luscious canapes (and not wearing a sport jacket, you may be sure), an older
man in IBM costume - very dark blue suit, white shirt, striped tie,
conservative black wingtips - came over and introduced himself as a Garland
Briggs "from 590."  "I envy you people from the Watson Laboratory," he said.
"Those of us at World Headquarters don't feel free to have a drink at lunch."
"Must be tough," I said sympathetically, setting my empty glass on a tray and
reaching for another big manhattan.

<p>

Actually I was safe.  No one from 590 would dream that the bearded character
in the gray suit worked for IBM.  Briggs, who had a degree in astronomy [!],
knew Eckert and was interested in me, and in what we had been doing for the
Bomb Boys.  He was trying very unobtrusively to warn me of the No Booze rule,
and I realized only a few weeks later that I had been, in a very unusual way,
warmly treated.

<p>

Briggs had migrated to the headmastership of a fancy boy's school, and tripped
over the Depression.  A friend had slid him into the financial structure
<a name="[-76-]"><font color="red">[-76-]</font></a>
at IBM in the late Thirties, and by 1945 he was something like Assistant
Treasurer.

<p>

Eckert told me his story.  A few weeks after he came to 590, and long before
he had recovered financially, his son came down with polio.  No sparrows were
permitted to fall anywhere near IBM without The Old Man hearing.  He ordered
that "the young man" be given the best medical care, at IBM expense, and as I
said earlier, turned to his next imperial task.  Briggs would have died for
him.

<p>

Later in the year of the SSEC dedication [1948], the Watson secretariat at 590
found time for The Great Man to make his first visit to the Watson Lab.
Eckert was informed well in advance, and sat down with me to decide what to
show him.  Lacking an elevator, it had to be the three "main" floors, or less.
We decided on the first floor machine room, because of the unusual Aberdeen
machines which he had not seen in their latest form, and one or both of Pete
Luhn's specials (this was the occasion on which T.J.  "ordered" Pete to
separate the calculating equipment and the work station).

<p>

Wallace wanted to show him the measuring engine Dick Bennett was laboring
over.  I thought it ill-advised to be too astronomical, but Dr. E. was the
boss.  And instead of his ascending painfully to Eckert's eyrie, we decided to
set him down in the beautiful library for the hardware presentation, and then
trot him back to the electronics lab, which you haven't heard about yet.  Then
back to the waiting limousines and 590.

<p>

Mary Noble and her advance men descended on us like furies.  Windows had to be
washed, slip covers and curtains sent out for dry cleaning.  Strange actors
from 590 invaded our stage and irritated the junior staff and the Columbia
janitors (I was absolutely agog; they could have rolled me up and sent me to
the cleaners too, and I would not have protested).  Amazingly, a flower fund
was installed at the nearest good florist, and the receptionist (who had
lovely hay fever as well as lovely everything else) was dragooned into
stopping for masses of fresh flowers every day or two.  As Mary Noble well
knew, Watson might suddenly decide to go to Washington, or Timbuctoo, or even
Endicott.  The Visit, as we had begun to capitalize it, was iffy.

<p>

On D Day, we received minute-by-minute reports.  I honestly think little
people were stationed in phone booths along Broadway (Manhattan phone booths
still worked in those days) to report on the cavalcade.  Remember, there were
no car telephones or CBs.  Yet the switchboard would report, "They're at
Columbus Circle."  "They're at 79th."  "They're at 108th."  And the entourage
swept in, only a little behind schedule (the secretariat had probably squeezed
in the Chilean ambassador at the last moment).

<p>

Everything went well.  We gathered for farewells in the reception area.
Mr. Watson looked around the room, which was panelled in cream and touched off
by half a dozen small oil paintings of Paris scenes I had chosen from Mary
Noble's best.  He looked approvingly at his portrait over the fireplace.  He
nodded his head.  "Everything is quite nice," he said, and the heads of the
company all nodded blissfully.  "There is just one thing, though."  The heads
of the 590 people all began to shake doubtfully, and the 116th Streeters began
to shake all over.

<p>

"These paintings," he said, waving his imperial arm around the room (he
<a name="[-77-]"><font color="red">[-77-]</font></a>
was a big man).  "There should be photographs of galaxies, and atoms, and
scientific things.  This is a laboratory, after all."  Mary Noble turned
white.

<p>

"Mr. Watson," I said, "our visitors see that sort of thing all the time.  What
really impresses them is that IBM, a world leader in technology, has collected
these beautiful paintings - is a patron of the arts as well as of science."
Dead silence.  This miserable, bearded nonentity has contradicted Mr. Watson!!

<p>

He looked hard at me for a moment.  As Pete Luhn said about his own case, if I
ever tripped up in the future, The Old Man would remember my intransigence and
my beard.  He asked a vice president about the limousines; the whole entourage
of seniors and sycophants swept out; peace descended like a blessing from on
high.

<p>

The very next day Mary Noble appeared.  "Doctor, about those galaxies and
things...".  "Forget it, Mary Noble," I said.  "Those paintings stay right
where they are."  "But Dr. Grosch - he specifically said...".  "Let's call him
up and check.  My recollection is that he agreed with me."  "Oh God, no!"

<p>

When I left for Washington more than two years later the big room still looked
lovely.  Watson never visited again.  But when the laboratory people outgrew
the little 116th Street building and everybody moved into much larger quarters
nearby, the pictures in the new lobby were not from the art collection, but
"galaxies, and atoms, and scientific things."  Eckert remembered!

<p>

And Mary Noble turned off the flower fund on her way back to 590.

<a name="[-79-]"><font color="red">[-79-]</font></a>

Life on 116th Street was not all panelled reception areas and the IBM ceramics
collection.  The Watson Lab was a nexus of attention for men and women all
over the world who had dreamed for years, or had now begun to dream, about
doing big technical calculations.

<p>

They read about the ASCC - the Harvard Machine, everybody called it, since
Aiken's militaristic "Mark I" didn't sound right, postwar.  But like a
khaki-suited dog in the manger, and acting as if he had one of his migraines
even when he didn't, Howard drove the supplicants from the temple.  In the
days before ENIAC and the SSEC came on stream, he controlled the
best-publicized fraction of the world's computer resources.  And he was
wasting it on a ridiculous project to calculate Bessel functions.

<p>

In fact, even Bessel function enthusiasts were upset.  Dorothy and I had a
famous applied mathematician as house guest - J.C.P. Miller, who was helping
Comrie establish the first for-pay scientific computing bureau, in London.  He
spent much of his leisure time plowing through every page of my 1942-47
collection of ASTOUNDING, from which he had been cut off in wartime England,
and what little time was left in "collecting" New York's bridges.  Well,
Miller, who like Maxwell had spent untold hours bent over a hot desk
calculator, grumbled first about unnecessary accuracy and then, reluctantly,
admitted that "the new machines" would calculate such things as they went
along, so that great tables were obsolete.

<p>

So it was no use petitioning at Harvard.  A few super-priority jobs got taken
on - Los Alamos stuff - via high Navy channels, but in general, no.  The
announcement of ENIAC raised fewer hopes, because the monster was to be
shipped off to Aberdeen Proving Ground as soon as it could stand the journey,
and the backlog of Army calculations waiting for it there was known to be
enormous.  And not nearly as silly as Aiken's Bessel functions; at least the
Army
<a name="[-80-]"><font color="red">[-80-]</font></a>
planned to kill some people outright with their computations, and not just
bore them to death!

<p>

The SSEC was different.  Watson had dedicated it to science - or to Science,
to be precise - and there were ways to get access.  You could be in the Pure
Science Department; Eckert did his Moon calculations, and I did a beautiful
optical job.  You could be an astronomer, which meant you knew Eckert, and
about the older Columbia bureau.  You could appeal to the remains of wartime
patriotism (and of priorities, which never did die off completely), often
through John McPherson.  You could come in via Columbia connections.  You
could be a specially-favored IBM customer, like General Electric.

<p>

Eckert and I, with help from Hilleth Thomas and the physics table at the
Faculty Club, performed a calculational triage.  Some applications went
downtown, for Rex Seeber and his crew to fit in on the overloaded SSEC.  Some
ended up in my machine rooms on 116th Street, either queued up for my
youngsters to run - that is, to analyze and wire plugboards and push the cards
- or struggled over by the sponsors themselves, when they could get machine
time (usually in the evening).  And a lot were put in a quiet place to die.

<p>

One major job done on the SSEC was a simulation of nuclear fission for David
Hill of Los Alamos.  He used an analogy based on a drop of liquid, and the
resulting equations were unclassified - in fact, his results were published.
Wouldn't happen today, but we were at peace in the late Forties.

<p>

Another was an unsuccessful attempt to calculate steam flow through the blades
and buckets of a giant power turbine, using fancy applied math from an
academic consultant and the lovely money of the General Electric Large Steam
Turbine Department.  That was the first job the SSEC undertook for pay.  It
introduced me to a pupil of the great Theodor von Karman, an aerodynamics
expert from Schenectady named Hans Kraft who became a valued friend.  His
calculations did not converge satisfactorily, but he did not blame the SSEC -
only his consultant and himself.  Would that the tens of thousands of
customers of such activities who were to follow him had been so civilized!

<p>

At Columbia I serviced George Kimball, a chemistry professor who wanted to use
computing instead of test tubes.  He introduced me to the American Chemical
Society committee on punched cards, I introduced the committee to the strange
relay machines and European ingenuity of Pete Luhn, and Pete ended up many
years later president of ASIS, the American Society for Information Science.
ASIS is sort of the computers-for-library-science outfit, and strong on
information retrieval.

<p>

Because I would almost certainly forget to mention it later on, I'll say here
that Pete was also the father of automatic abstracting and indexing, common
currency today on PCs and word processors.  He had the idea of counting word
occurrences in text - he used paper tapes from TIME - discarding a standard
list of linking words (and, the, to) and no-content words (I, ouch, today),
and ranking the rest by frequency.  He assigned weights, went back and counted
the sum of the weights of the words in sentences, ranked the sentences, picked
out a few of the weightiest, printed them out in their original order and with
the garbage words put back in - presto: an abstract.  Not bad for a German
relay circuit designer, over thirty years ago!

<p>
<a name="[-81-]"><font color="red">[-81-]</font></a>

Kimball also sent me over some X-ray diffraction experts, who needed a lot of
low-precision sums of products.  For half a century they had been using
Beevers-Lipson strips, sort of cardboard slide rules.  Punched card machinery
looked good to them.  I helped a formidable woman do hemoglobin on our 405,
and hoped the Watson Lab was helping medical research too.

<p>

Another Columbia figure was Maurice Ewing, an oceanographer who had done
important war research on propagation of sound between the thermal layers of
the ocean.  He mostly sent over graduate students, one of whom, Frank Press,
was much later the president of the National Academy of Sciences.  Another
became a major figure in radio astronomy, which had not yet begun to surge in
1949.  And I remember several attractive women.

<p>

Early on, before the SSEC was commissioned, I undertook my last serious
astronomical project.  There had been a famous facility in Germany, the
Astronomisches Rechen-Institut, which calculated (by hand, and with enormous
diligence) the annual appearances of the 1500 or so named asteroids.  Most of
them didn't excite anybody very much - my Adonis was an exception, and there
were other unusual ones, and the larger objects of course - but you had to
eliminate them when you were finding new ones.  The task kept a dozen
subprofessionals busy around the year; the annual appearance of KLEINE
PLANETEN memorialized their efforts.

<p>

Well, their institute was rubble in 1946, and the people scattered or dead -
and no money to pay them with if they reappeared.  The KP was published two
years in advance, so 1945 and 1946 had come out before the crunch.  There were
plans to do the 1948 in Leningrad (the Iron Curtain had not yet descended, and
we had occasional Russian visitors at the Watson Lab).  The question was, how
to produce the 1947 volume, in just a few months.  It was an ideal task for
Comrie/Eckert punched card techniques; I said we'd try.

<p>

We made it with a few weeks to spare.  I did the planning, and printed up the
final results on hectograph masters (shades of Allan Maxwell's computing
forms!).  Had to put in some decimal points, and degree symbols and such, by
hand; Eckert and I had talked about using the gorgeous table printing
typewriter at the Naval Observatory, and sighed over how handsome the result
would have been; alas, there wasn't time.

<p>

The calculations would have taken many weeks on the regular machines, but we
had just received our two Aberdeen machines - correct IBM nomenclature:
Pluggable Sequence Relay Calculators.  And equally important, I was in process
of absorbing the remains of the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing
Bureau.  And while the machines were pretty standard, I was delighted to find
Lillian Hausman in the first crate!

<p>

She not only was a superb operator - after all, she was the senior full-time
scientific punched card expert in the whole world - but she knew a lot of
astronomy.  In fact, she probably could have done my part of the job too.
Anyhow, she wired the horrific Aberdeen boards, helped run the big decks at
what seemed like miraculous speed (6,000 multi-operation cards an hour, or say
0.000005 megaflops).

<p>

Another nice benefit was that Lillian was so eager to learn the very difficult
new machine, and my supervisor Marjorie Severy was so genuinely admiring of
her skills, and we were all so crazy busy with the asteroids, and
<a name="[-82-]"><font color="red">[-82-]</font></a>
the Columbia night workers, and helping train the youngsters like John Backus
and Ted Codd for their coming SSEC duties, that there were no jealousies and
no frictions, and we all ended up on the same side.  Everybody laughed their
heads off at my adventures with Mary Noble and the art collections, and that
helped a lot.  It was a good, good time.

<p>

About equipment: after merging in the better machines from the Pupin attic (I
kept the old 285 horizontal tabulator as long as Marjorie had room for it, out
of sheer wonder at its clumsiness), we had two machine rooms with sorters and
reproducers and collators, an interpreter, a gang punch, and several key
punches.  The most expensive machine (renting for over $1000 a month with all
the bells and whistles I could hang on it) was the huge 405 tabulator, with 80
characters of alphanumeric storage, eating and disgorging 150 80-character
cards a minute, printing 80 characters wide a line at a time (the type bars
were too long to do this at full speed, but other models could print numbers
only, at 150 lines a minute or 200 digits a second; the earth shook!).

<p>

The key machines, however, were the multiplying punches, of which I once, for
a few weeks, had fourteen.  Most were Type 601s, modified to take account of
the algebraic signs of the three operands.  The typical operation was A times
B, with C added or subtracted from the product; it proceeded at the
spectacular rate of 600 operations an hour.  Usually the operands were read
from a card and the answer punched on the same card, but you could get real
wizard and hold a factor over from one card to the next, or make it a constant
for a while under control of master punches in the deck.  Fancy, huh?

<p>

The punching mechanism on the 601 was derived from the key punches, so you had
to put funny metal or formica strips (you could file the formica ones
yourself) called skip bars, on the carriage, to suppress unwanted punch
cycles.  Every machine room had racks of these stupid things, usually near the
key punches, and you planned your output so as not to have to cut a fresh skip
bar!

<p>

The 601s broke down pretty regularly, often signaling their malaise by
throwing their cards petulantly on the floor.  It was not uncommon for late
workers - my wife Dorothy and I, for instance - to quit only after the last
multiplier was busted.  You left notes for the IBM customer engineer, who in
our case came very early six days a week and fixed as many machines as he
could before the troops arrived.  (The notes helped him decide which machines
would respond most readily.)

<p>

Need I say all these machines were black?  The day of The Grim Gray Giant, a
phrase I coined when the 700-series machines were gray, or of Big Blue,
today's equivalent, had not arrived.  All the major machines had little locked
trapdoors, behind which lived curious stylized blueprints of that machine's
current features - the bells and whistles I referred to.  The customer
engineer kept these prints up to date as he added selectors and emitters and
such; when a new engineer appeared he opened the trapdoor and read his
patient's chart.  All the keys were identical, and the rites of passage for a
new supervisor included capturing one of the keys, so as to be able to gaze
blankly at the secret documents of "his" machines.  Marjorie depended on
feminine
<a name="[-83-]"><font color="red">[-83-]</font></a>
appeal, and someone always produced the prints when she needed them.
<i>Lillian</i> had a key.

<p>

As the IBM inventors and designers got into the post-war swing, improvements
began to emerge.  I traded four of my least reliable 601s for a new 602, which
had a larger and more rational plugboard, requiring new kinds of plugwires
(sigh!) but with a "flexible" skip bar (ah!) you stuck little teeth into.  It
was more microprogrammable than the 601s, which was admittedly faint praise.
And it was a little faster.  And the control punches for algebraic signs could
be in any of the eighty card columns.

<p>

But the 602 was a failure.  Our copy worked fine, but of course we had really
great maintenance.  Most of the machines out in the field seemed to be tender,
and didn't stand up nearly as well as planned (the 601s cost the earth to
maintain, and the 602s were intended to be much cheaper).  Now, T.J. didn't
permit IBM to put out fallible machines; there was a whole string of poor
jokes built around the idea that customer engineers were supposed to work on
the <u>customer</u>! So the 602 was not, ah, withdrawn; it was upgraded to a
602A.  True, to anyone but a very loyal IBMer the 602A looked like an entirely
different machine, from plugboard to covers.  Well, it used those same new
plugwires, hmm? Anyhow, I reluctantly traded in my 602 for a 602A; the
youngsters learned its capabilities, approved heartily, and in the end asked
for more.

<p>

About documentation: the poor little wartime manuals were replaced for even
the simplest machines by handsomer, well-illustrated, glossy-paper successors.
The contents were dull: routine operating dope with a few very simple
plugboard diagrams, which most supervisors and operators followed blindly.  To
tell the truth, so did I when it came to one mysterious machine called the
collator.  Lillian claimed to understand it, and one of our brightest young
men, Eric Hankam, could make it (and the 602, and the 602A) sit up and beg.  I
suspect they opened those trapdoors and studied, when nobody was around!

<p>

One of the rival orbit computing shops back in my days with Maxwell had been
at Cincinnati Observatory, and it was run by a Paul Herget.  Paul had come out
of the Bottoms, which is Cincinnati talk for the poorest part of town, and he
dreamed of some day being director of the observatory.  The director in the
Thirties was Everett Yowell Sr., whose son knelt down in front of the 285 with
Lillian and me when I was learning wiring in 1945.

<p>

Paul went to the Naval Observatory to help with WW II, arriving after I left
but long before Eckert was called away to New York by Watson.  He was a great
success - probably why Maxwell wanted to go, a little later - and became a
leading expert on IBM machines like the 601.  I mention it here because in
early 1946 he published, at his own expense (those were the days!), a most
peculiar private operating manual for that machine.  He had discovered that
many of the plugboard holes, and the functions they controlled, had extra
capabilities.  There were things called "bottle plugs" - think of them as
pawn-move plugwires, connecting adjacent holes - which were described as
switches in the IBM documentation.  Paul told us to wire some of those
switches both on and off, simultaneously, and what the results would be.

<p>

For about three years possession of one of these coverless manuals was the
secret mark of a scientific (IBM) computer - again, computers were still
<a name="[-84-]"><font color="red">[-84-]</font></a>
people in those halcyon days.  They were photostated extensively up and down
Watson Country, and even overseas - no Export Control Act!  When the 602As
emerged, the people who had Herget manuals were the first to get the new
machines, so the flowering was brief.  I had the same experience later with my
special kind of punched card mathematical tables, which blossomed nicely but
was killed off by cheap storage.

<p>

My shop had an advantage for the IBM engineering groups.  It was full of
bright users, some of them IBM employees and some, outsiders like Ewing's
students and Dr. Hemoglobin.  One-off machines and prototypes could be tried
out "at Columbia" without the hazards of public announcement and 602-type
failure.  Luhn was our first patron, partly because of The Scientist We Love
To Hate, Edward Teller.

<p>

The Los Alamos connection wound down rapidly in 1946.  I was a charter member
of the Federation of Atomic Scientists, which started its third chapter at
Columbia, and worked at getting the Manhattan District to take away our
classified material; the people we had dealt with were scattering; Eckert
wanted to get back to astronomy.  Urey came back to Columbia for a while, as
did Rabi from the radar labs at MIT.  Johnnie von Neumann dived into
computers.  Feynman disappeared for a while, and emerged with a Nobel, as did
a terrific woman named Maria Mayer.

<p>

Maria and Joe Mayer, and I think Roy Marshak, brought Teller around to the
Watson Lab in late 1945.  He had some partial integro-differential equations
to solve, and money to solve them with.  I never knew how IBM handled my
initial calculations; the Old Man might well have done them as an act of
patriotism, but somehow I think the beancounters probably sent General Groves
a bill.  Same for Teller.  I didn't yet know about the Super, as the hydrogen
bomb was then called at Los Alamos, so I didn't try to avoid the job.

<p>

Problem was, the sequences of calculation were much lengthier than the ones we
had been doing.  Not more difficult - Teller's people had punched card
machinery in mind when they did the numerical analysis.  But it looked like
hundreds of plugboards per cycle, instead of two or three dozen.  I reported
this to John McPherson.

<p>

A few days later an elegantly dressed engineer named H.P. Luhn came down from
Endicott (T.J. paid his inventors - in fact, everybody but me - very well).
He told Eric Hankam and me about his experimental relay calculators.  For the
smaller one he had modified a key punch [!!] by adding several movable sets of
reading brushes - the holes in IBM cards were read by little wire brushes that
contacted a brass roller when holes came along, and the timing of the
electrical pulses told the machine what the numbers or letters were.  Luhn had
his machine punch out initial results to save storage; that result was then
read downstream by one of the brush sets and used as one operand in the next
addition or multiplication, and so on until you ran off the end of the card.
Eric loved it (he was a three-dimensional chess enthusiast).

<p>

The arithmetic was done in a box on the back containing almost a thousand Lake
relays, which Frank Hamilton was using in vast quantities in the SSEC as
intermediate storage.  There were the inevitable plugboards, but I seem to
remember some of the sequences were hard-wired after Eric's analysis.  Oh,
when a card was full you reproduced the good stuff onto the
<a name="[-85-]"><font color="red">[-85-]</font></a>
beginning of a fresh card, so in a sense you could think of a hundred-card
string as a single 6,000- or 7,000-column card.  As in the earlier work on the
Trinity burst, there was to be a card for each space point, and a deck for
each time step.

<p>

Eric ran the thing himself.  He and I both took the transformation of Teller's
equation into number crunching as a given.  I didn't want to know, Eric really
enjoyed the machine more than the mathematics, and we both knew we could call
on Hilleth Thomas for help if the calculations ran away.  If they did, nobody
told us.

<p>

Pete had shipped us two machines; the other was a modified 405 tabulator with
a separate, much larger box of relays.  One of the machines was named Virginia
- I think the larger, which was the one T.J.  ordered him to split up.  The
other was called Nancy - also feminine.  The smaller one I put in the space
next to the disputed first floor WC, so Pete could show it off; the other had
to go in the main machine room, much to everyone's annoyance.  But one of
Pete's young engineers kept it occupied, and gave us a lot of informal
intelligence about progress on the SSEC on the side.

<p>

Pete also made several copies of a Survey Computer, which was supposed to go
out in the field (say, 150 pounds - and it needed 110 volts).  It was an
electric typewriter hooked up to the usual Luhn box of relays, and it did
polar to rectangular coordinates.  You typed in X and Y, and a series of
distance-azimuth pairs that you had measured with your surveying instruments,
and the machine typed out a series of new Xs and Ys.  Shades of today's
handheld calculators, which will do the same including printing, and three
times faster, for less than a hundred dollars!

<p>

I produced an extremely compact table of sines and cosines, which were
hard-wired into stepper switches in the relay box.  Reminded me of the little
boresighting gadget I had done aeons ago at Navy Ordnance (ah, six years ago,
that is).

<p>

After Virginia And Friend disappeared a modified mark sensing machine lived
near the WC for a while.  IBM made a machine that read soft pencil marks
(electrically, not optically), and also sold "special" pencils at a huge
markup.  The machine ate paper sheets with multiple-choice tests on them, and
scored the results on a meter.  Analog, by gosh! Anyhow, some engineer wanted
to convert the meter reading to digits and punch it on a card.  Bob Walker was
contemptuous - oh, I haven't gotten to him yet!

<p>

The final occupant of that space was the prototype, good old Serial Number
Zero, of the enormously successful IBM 604.  When Mr. Watson decreed the SSEC,
he also set wheels in motion "to use these electronic capabilities in the
IBM."  The circuits had been patented before the war, mainly by one Halsey
Dickinson, whose photo showed up in the SSEC brochure.

<p>

At about the same time as the SSEC dedication, IBM let the sales force have a
few - twenty, maybe? - Type 603 Electronic Multiplying Punches.  These were
one-card-feed gang punches that ate a hundred cards a minute, read two
six-digit factors off each card, and punched the product on the same
<a name="[-86-]"><font color="red">[-86-]</font></a>
card.  That's all - you couldn't even control rounding - but it ran ten times
as fast as a 601.  Convair San Diego swore by theirs.

<p>

The box of electronics was connected to the punch by a cable over an inch in
diameter, and contained about 600 full-sized vacuum tubes - the same as the
ones used so lavishly in the SSEC.  I sat it up on a window-seat in the
downstairs machine room, and we opened the window behind it whenever we used
it - great space heater! We soon had better stuff, so it didn't stay too long.

<p>

Now, the 604 was a different matter.  It was post-war circuitry and miniature
tubes, and designed for production.  I got mine in early 1949, and the first
production version went to Freddie Uffelman at Oak Ridge, and was the Big
Event of ACM's annual meeting down there later that year.  That was the second
ACM meeting outside New York; there had been a major conference at Aberdeen
the year before, with Johnnie Von presiding over one session, at which John
Mauchly describing the metal tapes of his next machine (which turned out to be
the UNIVAC I).

<p>

Freddie got Number One because there were still priorities; he used it to keep
track of the raw materials and finished products at Oak Ridge, which was still
a restricted city.  Lots of mason jar white lightning, though!

<p>

He was really doing a very simple inventory/accounting job, but with
extra-sensitive goods.  He wasn't an academic, and his crew were hill girls he
had raised from key punchers.  But he was sharp.  Too sharp for IBM; he
complained profanely all the way up to 590 that the #$%&amp;* 604 wouldn't run
right.  "Fix it," he screamed," or I'll have my boss telephone Old Man
Watson."

<p>

I went over to see him from the ACM meeting, with Red Dunwell, later to be the
head of the STRETCH imbroglio.  Red was conciliatory.  I christened Master
Uffelman "Foul-mouthed Freddie," which tickled the dear boy no end - and his
harem, too.  In the end I persuaded Red to persuade IBM to replace every
single one of those 1500 miniature tubes; they'd gotten cooked somehow, and
FMF was quite right.  I was awarded the Mason Jar Accolade; not by preference,
but all of the hill girls were temporarily taken.

<p>

About Uffelman: like many of the best punched card whizzes of the day, he was
self-taught; had no degree of any sort.  Yet he was married to the daughter of
a fancy Berkeley professor (well, actually only a dean).  He had had most of
his gut removed some years back, and was all crouched over and miserable; no
wonder he was foul.  He begged the doctors to help him, and they said,
"Frederick, this is a Big Deal; when you don't care any more whether you die
on the table or not, come back."

<p>

Shortly after his 604 got cracking, he went back and said, "I'd rather be
dead!"  So they took out the rest of his innards, and it worked fine: last
time I visited he was playing softball, and his harem was noticeably less
horny.  His wife Jane stood by him beautifully through all this, left him
when he was out of trouble, and ended up a valued member of the Rand
Corporation staff in Santa Monica.

<p>

The 604 came out of Poughkeepsie, which by 1949 had been transformed from a
typewriter plant into an impressive electronic enterprise.  This was Ralph
Palmer country, and he had great people from MIT and other centers of
excellence working for him.  The machines came streaming down the floor,
<a name="[-87-]"><font color="red">[-87-]</font></a>
and customers - not all scientific, either - were lined up outside begging for
more.

<p>

The punch unit was much more sophisticated than the one on the 603, and the
electronics box was five feet high and quite handsome, at least to someone who
had had a 285, or racks of skip bars!  On one end of the electronic unit was a
one-panel plugboard, and it used ordinary plugwires - none of that ENIAC coax.
The thing that fascinated the early users was that the machine was what we
would now call microprogrammable; you could put together counters of various
sizes, perform a completely flexible string of commands pipeline style, carry
data over from card to card - and you could divide!

<p>

In those days one of the commonest problem areas was matrix arithmetic: sets
of simultaneous linear equations, and so on.  I had had to do several sets of
sixth order, to pretty high accuracy, in my thesis work.  On the Marchant that
took most of a day, and the time went up as the cube of the order - that is, a
set of twelve equations would have taken eight times as long; say a full week.
At the Watson Lab this was a common exercise, involving a fairly complex
pattern of eight plugboards and careful sorting.  On the 601 the time dropped
by a factor of about five compared to a desk calculator, which meant that if
we had been paying rent for the machines and the building, and so on, hand
work would have been about as cheap (Comrie said the same, in London).

<p>

The 602 and 602A helped, but not by much.  But the 604 ate the problem for
breakfast, or so it seemed at the time; cost per hour, if the shop had been
run for pay, would have been about the same, and the speed was at least six or
seven times the 602A, and nearly ten times our vanishing 601s.

<p>

That brings up horse racing - yes, really!  I had met a strange little man
named Andrew Salter, who was a psychologist or thereabouts, and who worked
over an impressive range of Broadway and Hollywood types in his Park Avenue
office - Judy Garland, for one.  He made the cover of LOOK the year I met him:
something about hypnosis.  He offered to operate on my wife Dorothy, which
sounded good to me but emphatically not, to her.

<p>

Andy had a wall of bound Racing Forms and other Triangle publications outside
his office.  This was decades before Dick Francis, and I didn't know much
about racing, or (more important) about betting.  But the prospect of
supplementing my IBM pay - Andy said we ought to be madly rich in no time -
drew me in.  I proposed to work out a predictor formula, linear in twenty
variables like jockey weight and track muddiness, which would give the most
probable speed of the horses in tomorrow's race.

<p>

Parenthetically, this is about what most stock market prediction programs do
today, on microcomputers.  They make it sound much jazzier, of course.

<p>

In betting (and I suspect in the stock market play as well), you then have to
apportion your money in accord with how others are playing; it does little
good to bet only on the winner, and especially if the odds are poor.  I had
ideas about how to do it, but never got that far.  I fit my formula, by least
squares, to the horses in a set of a hundred past races which Andy and I
carefully picked.  The 604 gave me the results in a few hours, versus weeks on
a 601.

<p>

Playing the predictor back against the original hundred races, I found we did
only five percent better than random - and the track and the state were
<a name="[-88-]"><font color="red">[-88-]</font></a>
taking 17 percent.  And of course, results were bound to be less favorable on
past races not in our package, and still less on future cases.  So I shut
down.

<p>

It was literally years before I saw that the whole project was unethical -
that I had absolutely no right to use the Watson Lab equipment on such stuff.
The climate was incredibly different from today.  Everything was grist that
came to our mill.  Indeed, I got a tiny publication out of the experiment,
since the timings for 604 procedures on systems of that high an order were
news.  It wasn't even like, oh, using office supplies to write a letter; you
were Doing Something New, something challenging, something good for the art.
Today we would call it hacking, and I would be horrified at a senior
professional dreaming of such a thing.  Then, even Dorothy, who was a
distressingly moral person, never thought it questionable.

<p>

Before I get to the Aberdeen machines, I need to write a little more about
what professors call "the literature."  There wasn't any - at least for
computers.  Stuff about astronomical calculations went in astronomy journals;
about optics, in JOSA, the Journal of the Optical Society (which is where I
published Grosch's Law, <i>mirabile dictu!</i>); about punched card
techniques, in IBM's Pointers.  I must mention the exception, MTAC
(Mathematical Tables and other Aids to Computation), published quarterly at
Brown University with National Research Council money by a Professor
Archibald.

<p>

This was where Comrie, and Jeff Miller the bridge collector, and their
American counterparts hung out, and it was where the very earliest
descriptions of gadgets too special to get into the stodgy electrical
engineering journals had to be published.  Wallace Eckert's card-operated
typewriter at the Nautical Almanac Office is there, and the big Bell Labs
relay machine - and my Aberdeens.  It still appears, under a smoother title:
The Mathematics of Computation, or some such.  Its early years are a
cornucopia of antediluvian hardware history.  Some software, too, in a way -
Lillian and I put out lists of the punched card math tables in the Watson Lab
files, for instance, and people from Aarhus and Aberdeen and Acme Electric
wrote for copies.  In today's personal computing world, they call it
"freeware"!

<p>

There began to be specialized technical publications in 1949 and 1950, and
DATAMATION started in 1957 under an earlier name; now there are literally
thousands of magazines in several dozen languages - human, mostly, although I
seem to remember some in APL and LOGO - to satiate the old-timers and bewilder
the newcomers.  They range from the absurdly erudite to kiddie stuff, and all
are eager for material.  In the Thirties and Forties computer articles were
turned away from engineering and scientific journals unless very well
sponsored, and even MTAC was careful: snooty funding, and an Ivy League
location.

<p>

That having been said, I refer you to MTAC and an article on the IBM Pluggable
Sequence Relay Calculator if you want to read more about a really important
but forgotten machine.  Let me start with the word "Aberdeen"; the Aberdeen
Proving Grounds, in Maryland, was where the Army tested its guns and bombs and
tanks.  From World War One there had been a Ballistic Research Laboratory
there, where later Hilleth Thomas and Johnnie von Neumann did interior
ballistics (explosions) and Leland Cunningham - yes,
<a name="[-89-]"><font color="red">[-89-]</font></a>
the one that helped me learn to eat with chopsticks in Boston in 1940 - ran a
large punched card shop doing exterior ballistics (trajectories).

<p>

Why Cunningham? Well, in WW I a famous celestial mechanicker named Forest Ray
Moulton set them up with a hand computing facility, and they remembered.  When
the Army got into anti-aircraft fire and bomb trajectories in WW II Cunningham
ran out of capacity, even with IBM's best 601-type help.  The key officer
there - higher ones got most of the credit for a while - was a Major Leslie
Simon.  He let three contracts; in those urgent times, it probably took him
two or three weeks.  Today with competitive bidding, and EDS and Computer
Sciences, and the Big Business press watching, it would take two or three
years.

<p>

One contract was with the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the
University of Pennsylvania, and resulted in Pres Eckert and John Mauchly and
the ENIAC (note that the machine didn't get down to doing ballistic
calculations at Aberdeen until late 1947, by which time Cunningham had gone
back to orbit computing and Simon was a colonel).

<p>

A second was with the Bell Labs, and resulted in a magnificent machine made
out of rather slow telephone relays, with error detection and punched paper
tape input making it reliable enough to run all night unattended; it would
switch to the next problem if it got stuck, or shut down when it ran out.  It
had pieces of Fry and Shannon in it, but was mostly due to two men named Sam
Williams and George Stibitz.  And the self-checking features were elevated
later to a major part of the computer discipline by Dick Hamming, who came to
the Labs from Los Alamos.

<p>

Well, the Model V - there had been earlier Bell machines, for smaller tasks -
was slow, what with all that checking, and it didn't get to the Proving
Grounds until 1946 or so.  Mind you, it did yeoman work for years afterwards,
and so did ENIAC.  But neither, ah, saw duty in WW II.  The IBM machines did.

<p>

The third contract was with IBM Endicott, to develop two high-speed relay
calculators with plugboard sequencing.  Two, to run the same problem in
parallel (think of them as Maxwell and Grosch); high speed, because IBM had
developed the Lake relays, four times as fast as the telephone units, and was
building large numbers of them into supersecret cryptographic gear (MAGIC was
at least as secret as Los Alamos).  The key men for the Aberdeen project were
Ben Durfee and Don Piatt, both of whom later contributed to the SSEC - relay
storage, and much else.  The two machines were finished and shipped to
Aberdeen and put to work on actual ballistics before the end of the war; I
assume Watson had ordered that it be so!

<p>

At the end of the war they were both sent back to Endicott and rebuilt to more
advanced system requirements furnished by Cunningham (who had earlier
specified the sample calculation with which ENIAC was finally benchmarked).
At the same time three more were built to the new specs; one was sold or
rented to Dahlgren, the Navy's proving ground in Virginia, and the last two
came to the Watson Lab.  And by mid-1946; IBM didn't fool around.

<p>

Eckert and Lillian and Marjorie and I were delighted.  They were to be our
powerhouse for internal use for many years; until the lab moved to newer
quarters, I believe.  Really big jobs went to the SSEC downtown, and our
teaching was done on the standard machines, since IBM would build no more
<a name="[-90-]"><font color="red">[-90-]</font></a>
Aberdeens.  But for my minor planets, and Thomas' atomic physics, and the work
of our cleverer research visitors, they were the key equipment.  I still
treasure my dog-eared Ozalid operating manual.

<p>

Picture a looming black monster, filling a six-foot cube when closed.  The
front part was a much-modified 513 reproducer - two hundred-a-minute card
feeds and two stackers.  There were two double-panel plugboards dripping with
wires, on the front, and a panel of numerical switches on the right end.
Hinged to the back of the punch was a dour box of thousands of Lake relays,
and hinged to that a second box.  The covers were usually off for diagnosis,
although the un-air-conditioned and otherwise corrupted Morningside Heights
atmosphere was full of dirt.  There was a special oscilloscope cart nearby, to
check timings and look for contact bounce.  And lots and lots of thick cables.

<p>

Cards were read and punched at either feed under plugboard control: 16,000
decimal digits a minute at full bore.  Calculating speed was dependent on the
mix of operations: division and square root - yes, square root! - took almost
a whole card cycle, while two or three six-digit multiplies or half a dozen
faster operations could be fitted into the same.  Besides, the Aberdeens could
buzz away for several cycles without feeding or punching at all, but the
plugboards got awfully complicated.  On balance, each machine
problem-in-problem-out ran six or seven operations a second.

<p>

Mind you, the wonderful 604, when wired by an expert like Lillian or Eric, ran
almost that fast.  But we had the two Aberdeens for three solid years before I
got the prototype 604, and we ran each of them a hundred hours a week.
Powerhouse, indeed! The experimental machines that fill the history books
didn't even get fired up until the end of the decade, and had very little
input or output capacity.  Until 1949, it was places like Aberdeen and the
Watson Lab - including the SSEC - that were crunching the numbers; the Los
Alamos and tin airplane boys didn't have big machines, and the computers being
built in Britain and the U.S. weren't ready.  From 1944, when Aiken got the
ASCC, to the present day, the majority of scientific and engineering
computations worldwide have been done on IBM machinery.  Commercial data
processing too, of course, but that perspective is universally accepted.

<p>

One story about the Aberdeens and our night visitors: a Columbia connection
Wallace and I really enjoyed was with the astronomers.  Eckert was one of the
clan all his life, and while I soon realized I wasn't going back, I had
friends and admired great figures in the science.  One friend at Columbia who
obviously was going to be a great figure was Martin Schwarzschild, a nephew or
thereabouts of the nineteenth century astronomer/physicist/mathematician.
Martin had been at Harvard when Dorothy and I were courting, so his presence
close to the Watson Lab pleased both of us.  He had married a girl who was
helping him with his researches just as my wife was helping me.

<p>

Martin, who along with a dozen other contributions was later to become the
best-known balloon astronomer, was still doing stellar constitution
calculations - the sort of thing that almost drew me away from Maxwell in
1938.  Interest was high in the outer world because of the atomic upsurge;
people other than physicists and ASTOUNDING readers knew that the Sun was
powered by a nuclear furnace.  So, although he was too pure to be
<a name="[-91-]"><font color="red">[-91-]</font></a>
interested in fusion power and such, the public interest made him a prime
candidate for computer time.

<p>

Lillian wired him a complicated set of plugboards, and he came over with his
wife to run his cases.  We showed them how to print up the results on a
tabulator, how to reproduce fresh card decks, how to run a sorter.  He and
Barbara were sharp; it was easy.

<p>

They made their first long run one weekday evening, late.  There was a card
jam in the monster's punch unit.  Probably not their fault; all it took was a
defect on the leading edge of one card.  The two of them stood there watching.
Why weren't the cards coming out?

<p>

An experienced operator would have leapt for the stop button.  Even from
across the room, the change in the voice of the machine would have meant
trouble.  But it was all new to Martin and Barbara.  Suddenly the covers burst
open and a fountain of crumpled cards gushed out.  Typically, a card had been
accordioned to a cardboard rod eight inches long and about an eighth of an
inch square - and there were several hundred!

<p>

It took two youngsters and the customer engineer almost an hour to clean out
the junk next day.  Fortunately reconstructing the input cards was not too
difficult; while the two delightfully abashed Schwarzschilds were doing it I
asked them what they had felt.  "Herb," said Martin,"we thought the machine
was storing the data."  Wonderful!

Dorothy and I had lots of pleasures besides working until four o'clock in the
morning in a room full of recalcitrant black boxes.  Once the war wound down,
we began to use the freedoms of the IBM job and the Columbia Connection and my
Astronomical Society and Optical Society activities, and also again to enjoy
the outdoors.  After some hesitation she decided to give up her spectroscopy
at the midtown Interchemical Corporation laboratories, mostly to help me, but
also to eliminate the problem of fixed hours for her, and conflicting two-week
vacations, and the nasty commute from Long Island.

<p>

I had no fixed hours at the Watson Lab, nor did any of the professional staff;
Wallace gave us the same liberty we would have had across the street at
Columbia.  And he got the youngsters off the time clock, even though it was an
IBM product, and in spite of stories that The Old Man punched a gold-plated
one on the sixteenth floor at World Headquarters!

<p>

I had classes to meet, but not every semester.  So did Thomas, and Eckert
himself, irregularly (Lillian and Marjorie did the Machine Methods lab
sessions for him).  There was a steady stream of fascinating visitors from all
over the world: the assistant director of Pulkovo Observatory near Leningrad,
which was being rebuilt; a group of Indian statisticians - and Comrie!

<p>

He was to be honored at a meeting of the Institute of Navigation for the
beautiful tables he had turned out before and during the war, at His Majesty's
Nautical Almanac Office.  Dorothy and I had the great pleasure of escorting
him to the banquet, where he sat between us and Gerald Clemence, who had
succeeded Eckert at the Naval Observatory.

<p>

He was not too vigorous physically, but full of new computing projects, and
with plans to expand the commercial - well, not very! - scientific computing
service he had started on Bedford Square in London.  He looked rather Scottish
(I did not yet know he was a New Zealander; the current pleasant habit of
appending a sentence or two of biography at the end of a technical
<a name="[-94-]"><font color="red">[-94-]</font></a>
article was not then common).  He was quiet until things got going, and then
his enthusiasms took over.  Can you imagine being excited over which numerical
type fonts worked better in a math table? Shades of Don Knuth!

<p>

He had just published a magnificent INDEX OF MATHEMATICAL TABLES, one of whose
authors was J.C.P. Miller.  Comrie intended to update and extend it, and
Dorothy and I volunteered to work up a cross-file as a third part of the new
edition.  This involved her key-punching a good part of the 450-page book; the
days of machine-readable text were many years off.  The major part was
arranged by function, and the second was a bibliography of the books and
articles where the tables were to be found; we were to furnish a listing of
which tables were in each book or article.

<p>

I did the system design and printed up the results; she did the hard part.  We
sent the cards and listings over to England a year or so later, and Comrie
added it to the second edition.  It was in some ways a contribution to a dying
art, like hardening copper and gold (or designing lenses by hand, or wiring
plugboards).  But I was still deeply engrossed in 1947 computing techniques,
although of course excited about how they were going to change as electronics
took over.

<p>

Comrie, and Wallace Eckert of course, also saw these changes coming.  But I
had been reading science fiction for over twenty years, if you count the Oz
books.  I was more at ease than they were, in the future, although I much
enjoyed the present and valued the past.  About valued pasts: a year or two
after Comrie put out the new INDEX he was made the first member of the Royal
Society from our tribe.  He wasn't keen on honors, but that was one that
really counted.  He died in 1951.

<p>

As soon as gasoline rationing subsided, Dorothy and I began exploring.  We had
been limited to Long Island and the area immediately around Manhattan even
when I had my Farrand C ration, and our 1937 Plymouth had reached a
shuddersome mileage.  There was lovely country and new experience within
reach.  I got in touch with Jack Kissner, who designed and built foldboats in
Long Island City after the German Klepper type.  Ours had been one of the last
civilian models he had made in 1941, and he was just getting into production
again.  He invited us to join the little gang of enthusiasts who went out on
weekends to the Housatonic or the Delaware and enjoyed the white water, and
camped away from the roads and the traffic.

<p>

Along with Jack and his wife and daughter, our particular friends were Ted
Beckhardt and Chuck Weiss, who had served together in the U.S. mountain
troops.  Ted had been wounded at Monte Cassino, and was not yet up to vigorous
skiing.  Jack, Ted and Chuck (formerly Wolfgang) were all refugees from Hitler
Germany.  Ted's father left his Frankfurt department store behind and escaped
with his large Meissen china collection.  This resulted in a family porcelain
shop on Third Avenue, well thought of by serious collectors like my
Schenectady friend Hans Kraft.

<p>

Foldboating was really my first dangerous sport.  Following Ted and Chuck I
took up skiing; from skiing and a great deal of enraptured reading and book
collecting I started mountaineering, and from mountaineering I graduated to
the Cresta, which I rode for decades.  From sport cars I got into racing, and
from that into my third marriage - also dangerous, and also great fun.  But it
really
<a name="[-95-]"><font color="red">[-95-]</font></a>
started with white water running.  I perhaps ought to mention that I
was the first foldboater ever to do the main chute of the enormous Lachine
Rapids above Montreal (true, I did it upside down), and that I don't swim a
stroke!

<p>

A typical boating weekend would involve a hard drive in traffic out of the
city, stopping along the way for a quick snack, and setting up a tiny camp on
the river.  In the mists of morning we would take the cars and folded boats up
to the starting point, and a wife or girl friend would take one car back down
to the take-out place (we called this the "shuttle").  The heroes and heroines
of the day would set up the boats and take off.

<p>

Saturday night we would camp again, either out of the boats or where the
shuttle car had stopped.  This was the night for singing - usually German -
and campfire marshmallows, and loud snoring.  Sunday afternoon we would stop
early to dry the boats and repack them, becoming dry ourselves in the process.
The drivers would be shuttled up to get the other cars.  If possible we would
then go to a nearby restaurant and have a large and enthusiastic meal; there
was a big place called Flo-Jean's in Port Jervis on the Delaware that always
fitted us in, along with their fancy Sunday-driver customers, even when one of
us was in oilskins and a single espadrille, having lost his all in the river.
The owner was a canoeist.

<p>

For this my wife and I had to become campers.  She had done a lot of
early-California auto camping; I had hardly slept outdoors.  I applied the
usual medicine: went out and bought books about it!  Then we found postwar
sleeping bags - no down ones available yet - and cooking gear, and a very
small olive drab tent.  To erect it you used a short piece of wood as a
ridgepole, strung up the ridge using the lower branch of a friendly tree,
pulled out the side ropes, and behold: room for two good friends.  After a
little maturing we traded up to down sleeping bags that could be zipped
together; it was warmer on cold nights, and had other advantages.  In later
years the combination also accommodated a poodle puppy.

<p>

This weekend action was hard on cars.  They got into messy places, needed to
start easily after a night on the river, were required to hold large
quantities of junk, plus foldboats.  I took our wartime savings in hand and
went looking for a replacement for the faithful Plymouth.  "Not possible,"
said the Long Island small-car dealers, "we have a two-year waiting list of
pre-war customers." But this was New York, where people with friends or money
had lived well in spite of red points and blue points and gas coupons.

<p>

I thought about it.  In Manhattan fancy people were lined up outside the
Cadillac dealers, just as hoi polloi were queued for Fords in Hempstead.  But
how about fancy cars, in the boonies?  Jackpot!  They took my order for a
Roadmaster Buick convertible, with every option and accessory in the catalog.
Two years for a Chev, one year for a regular Buick, three months for a
Roadmaster; two months if you ordered fog lights.  Voila!

<p>

Dorothy and I had never even had a car radio.  We were living in a cheesebox,
and heating our hot water with pea coal.  But wow! did we have a car!  I had
vacation saved up, and besides, we astronomers ought as a matter of
professional business to attend the dedication of the 200-inch telescope on
Palomar.  Eckert didn't like to travel, thank heaven.

<p>

Dorothy and I planned the trip for a year.  I had maps of all the national
<a name="[-96-]"><font color="red">[-96-]</font></a>
parks and monuments, most of the national forests, special river maps that
showed profiles - where the rapids were steepest.  Since marriage we had
collected an almost complete set of the WPA Writers Project state guidebooks.
Gasoline companies gave away - yes, this was a long, long time ago - beautiful
highway maps.

<p>

I marked places where no Roadmaster, top up or top down, had ever been: a tiny
dirt road along the Colorado into Moab, the Escalante Canyon, Devil's
Postpile, the back road down from Lick Observatory.  We filled the trunk,
filled the back seat area, put in our foldboat and camp gear and the very
small tent.  And away we went.

<p>

We saw the American West at its best, with very few Americans yet cluttering
it up.  We camped, alone except for a few scrawny sheep, at the Black Canyon
of the Gunnison.  We drove most of the way around Crater Lake, until blocked
by snowdrifts - in July.  We cruised for hours on deserted roads at eighty
miles an hour.  We crossed Death Valley in midsummer with the top down.

<p>

And we indeed helped dedicate The Big Eye, along with hundreds of astronomers
from all over the world.  We saw Dorothy's family.  On the way back we stopped
in Reno, just before show time (Vegas was primitive by comparison, in 1948).
Dorothy ordered a trout; the waiter offered to bone it; she sent him away,
proud of her own skills - and the lights went down for the show!

<p>

About the eighty miles an hour: I hadn't yet gotten interested in sports cars
or racing, and wasn't knowledgeable enough to allow for the fact that the huge
Buick straight eight engine was splash lubricated.  We burned out the bearings
coming up from the Grand Coulee.  I sold the lovely beast "as is" in Spokane,
where there was a great apple harvest in prospect and no one had yet even
dreamed of a Roadmaster convertible, with or without fog lights.  We did
Glacier by train and Yellowstone and the Tetons by bus, and flew back to New
York from Jackson.  The Buick dealer in Spokane bundled up our big suitcase of
maps, our foldboat, and our very small tent, and expressed them home for us.

<p>

No Roadmaster meant problems with our river excursions.  I had been in the
Blue River above Dillon, and in the Gunnison, in Colorado.  And one of the
high points of the trip was a day on the Snake, below Teton National Park.  So
I wasn't exactly hurting for white water.  But when the spring runoff started
and the sun began to be warm even in Connecticut, we'd need transportation.

<p>

It wasn't an immediate problem, because we had moved into town just before we
left on the Palomar swing.  Dorothy said a reluctant goodbye to her victory
garden, I said good riddance to the pea coal supply, and Suzy the cat yowled
wistfully for her lost territory.  We found an interesting apartment in a
Chelsea townhouse, with the owners below to guarantee good heating and garbage
disposal.  There was little storage space, and the foldboat went to live
permanently at the lab, in the storeroom where I used to patch it after the
wilder trips.

<p>

We could go up to Columbia in twenty minutes on the subway, and that was a
real plus; the combination of driving to the Long Island station, changing in
Jamaica, battling the crowds in Penn Station, and riding the
<a name="[-97-]"><font color="red">[-97-]</font></a>
subway to 116th Street had taken an hour and a half each way.  I had usually
driven, and didn't mind with the older car, but even in the Forties leaving
something like the Buick on a New York street all day was asking for trouble.
I put a large sign saying "Trunk and glove compartment are EMPTY" in the
windshield after the top was slit the first time; I added a note that the
doors were unlocked.  The police ran me down one day and warned me that
unlocked cars were handy privies for bag ladies and such; I left undisturbed
the note that the doors were unlocked - but locked `em.  Also, although the
police were too busy to prevent damage to pretty cars, they were not too busy
to hand out parking tickets.  Ah, New York!

<p>

Another real plus was that Dorothy and I could now entertain - not just
visiting Brits, and other friends from out of town, but the youngsters from
the Watson Lab and the SSEC.  Marjorie was rather busy with her new husband,
Jack Herrick, and the natives like Lillian had their own families and friends,
but Betsy Stewart, the handsome woman at the SSEC console in the traditional
pictures, and Bill McClelland, and a certified Southern Belle named Aetna
Womble, and Woody Skillman, and a dozen other bright newcomers used to come to
our place, huddle over my von Bayros prints, and Frank Harris and Casanova,
listen to one of the first modern high-fi record players in town doing
Shostakovich and Benny Goodman, and pet our amiable cat Suzy.

<p>

Behind Aetna's charm lay an electrical engineering degree from Duke.  Behind
my amplifier circuits lay the Watson Lab electronics shop.  Behind Frank
Harris lay a growing collection of attractive erotica (the Danish pornography
revolution was a decade away).  Behind the little evenings lay our memories of
how observatory people and Cal Tech people used to enjoy each other.  The
Eckerts and the Thomases lived in a Columbia enclave in Leonia, New Jersey;
the IBM executives lived in luxury suburbs like Greenwich.  We were central,
and liked it.

<p>

There were birthday parties for the SSEC.  Since it was busy around the clock,
and since the No Booze rule was really serious, they were held outside.  The
second one was in the Dogwood Room on 58th Street, a relief stop for trampled
IBM executives not strong enough to face Grand Central.  John McPherson and
his wife came, much to everyone's pleasure, and I seem to remember Wallace and
Dorothy Eckert.  Rex Seeber and his wife, who lived up in IBM country, were
sort of givers of the feast.

<p>

There was a piano player, and much drinking.  McPherson pretended not to
notice, but could hardly ignore my asking the piano player to do what I
christened the Tom Junior Song: "Lucky old sun, with nothing to do but roll
around heaven all day."  Nevertheless it was a good party.

<p>

There was one other social component in our circle; I've hinted at it only
slightly.  Call it the other half of the Watson Laboratory, or the third part
of the IBM Pure Science operation, or call it the electronics group.  When
Wallace began to hire senior personnel for the lab, he looked also for men who
would supplement what he knew as the IBM engineering department.  The staff
director of engineering was his, ah, monitor, John McPherson; the Hamiltons
and the Luhns and the Piatts, and the Lakes and the Dickinsons before them,
got their floor space and their people and their paychecks from Endicott
<a name="[-98-]"><font color="red">[-98-]</font></a>
executives, their detailed technical instructions from John - and their
projects from T.J.

<p>

Eckert had seen some of this, and I assume was briefed about the 1945
situation in IBM when he came aboard.  He realized that the new electronics
was not yet represented in Endicott; he was close to Rabi, who was Number Two
at the MIT radar laboratories; he had some modern contacts even at the old-
fashioned Naval Observatory, and certainly through astronomer friends who were
doing war work.  One of Dorothy's bosses from Mount Wilson, for instance,
turned up doing magnetic mines, and others were in proximity fuses and such.
Wallace decided to help.

<p>

Through Rabi and other Columbia friends he turned up three men who were ready
to leave MIT: By (Byron Luther, a deep secret) Havens, John Lentz, and Robert
Walker.  To tie them to their later accomplishments in IBM, Havens was the
designer and builder of NORC, the Naval Ordnance Research Calculator - the
first supercomputer, delivered to Dahlgren in 1954.  He later moved to Europe
and became a senior manager at the beautiful IBM laboratory up behind Nice.

<p>

John Lentz was the father of the early IBM small scientific computers.  His
work led some years later to the 1620 and its progeny.  Bob Walker built an
analog linear equation solver, somewhat after the pattern of Clifford Berry,
Atanasoff's associate.  He also worked with a Columbia math professor named
Frank Murray, who was involved with the Cyclone machine (then still analog).

<p>

Eckert brought them to Columbia soon after Seeber and Thomas, and set them up
as an electronics group; today we would probably say, components group.
Walker took over the physical arrangements; there was a major workshop in back
of the second floor, with three technicians and an expediter (most supplies
came up from Cortlandt Street and the surplus houses, at least in 1945 and
1946).  He planned and set up the machine shop in the sub-basement.  And later
on he helped Havens put a NORC shop up in the Goat Room, a windowless fifth
floor space with an elegant floor and finished walls which I claimed was where
the fraternity toughs had initiated their new brothers.  It was the first
space in the Lab to be air conditioned: mid-1947, I'd guess.

<p>

There were few links between the Columbia professoriate and the three radar
experts, mostly because people like Ray Mindlin had been behind other walls
doing other war work.  Walker became friendly with Murray, as I said, and saw
a little Faculty Club action.  Lentz wanted to get his Ph.D., and so in spite
of his research record at MIT was in statu pupillari.  And Havens was soon too
busy to bother - tended to grab a sandwich at Chock Full O'Nuts.  Today all
three of them would be running work stations: be heavy users of computing.
Not in those days!  But I was fascinated with what they were doing, and played
Mohammed to their mountain for several years, so there was a link.

<p>

You have to remember there were no transistors yet.  The only semiconductors I
had seen were germanium diodes, exotic one-way devices which IBM had not yet
dared use behind the plugboards to eliminate back circuits.  The SSEC was
under construction, using full-sized vacuum tubes.  Havens and Lentz were
using miniatures.  Calculations and storage were decimal; ENIAC used ten or
eleven bottles per digit, the SSEC I think seven.  Havens was trying
<a name="[-99-]"><font color="red">[-99-]</font></a>
for four - that is, pure binary coding for each decimal digit.  His successes
(or initial successes, because it took a lot more than that to eventually
build a room-sized NORC) were carried off to Endicott, and later Poughkeepsie,
but Havens wanted to put together a whole system, not just furnish ideas or
experimental components to the boys upstate.

<p>

The electronics shop offered summer assistantships, and early on drew a
student from Harvard named Tony Oettinger, who succeeded Howard Aiken when he
finally retired, and later still became a president of ACM [1966].

<p>

My side of the house provided postdoctoral Watson Laboratory fellowships.  The
first holder was a young Belgian physicist named Carl Grosjean whom I met
again in the late Seventies; he had the chair of theoretical physics at Ghent,
and was on the verge of retirement.  Good grief!  Another was a chap from
Stuttgart named Helmuth Sassenfeld, who returned to the U.S. later and went to
work for von Braun in Huntsville.  And we had Americans, of course.

<p>

I used the term "social component."  Bob and Mildred Walker found a place near
our little Hempstead house, and we saw them frequently.  John Lentz and Alice,
who was a niece of Justice Burton of the Supreme Court, found a Riverside
Drive apartment through Columbia.  It had typical Manhattan advantages and
disadvantages; Burl Ives lived across the hall, and there were lots of
cockroaches.  It was partly envy of their location that drew Dorothy and me
into town later, and observation of Alice's problem that made us wary of
insect life.

<p>

John was an audio buff, in the days before this was common.  He had a huge
amplifier, built while they were at MIT, and was trying to add a variable-gate
preamp to cut the horrid scratch and rumble of 78 rpm shellac records.  This
is what is inside Dolby noise reduction circuitry today.  He never really got
it right, but like much else being done at the lab, it was interesting, and it
was very early.

<p>

He designed a later model amplifier for me, which I built at night in the
second floor shop, making the sheet metal chassis down in the sub-basement.
It used big black metal 6L6 tubes and a ten-pound audio transformer, and even
by today's standards was really very good.  Dorothy and I found a Hempstead
record shop with a big overstock of classical 78s, and arranged to return
albums that we played and didn't like - music or recording or too much
scratch.  Soon we had fifteen feet of solid shellac, although we never went
the Shapley Gilbert and Sullivan route.

<p>

John was too much of a purist to have a record changer, but we had an early
English Garrard.  After some 1946 investigation, he advised me to get a GE
variable-reluctance pickup, and it did yeoman duty until I retired the 78s
fourteen years later.  I still have two or three albums, notably the Szigeti
Beethoven and Piston's "Incredible Flutist" (and some vintage Goodman), but
don't have the machinery to play them now.

<p>

The records and the Lentzes led us to Carnegie Hall, where we had a
subscription for two years, but the problem of getting home to Long Island was
serious.  By the time we moved to Chelsea, we were doing Town Hall concerts
and Broadway musicals; the "Oklahoma" revolution was in full swing.  Senior
IBM executives tended toward the Metropolitan Opera because of the Watson
involvement, but I was not high enough in the heirarchy to ask
<a name="[-100-]"><font color="red">[-100-]</font></a>
for seats in the Imperial Box, and Wallace would have died a thousand deaths
if made to go.

<p>

About one other Watsonian interest: T.J. was a great believer in education.
In Endicott it tied to his job enrichment philosophy.  Where industrial
engineers elsewhere were trying to break bench jobs and assembly line jobs
into tiny specialisms - tighten one screw and pass the gizmo to the girl on
your right - Watson went the other way.  A new employee was put on a
single-spindle drill press, say.  After a few weeks he or she would be
encouraged to sign up for a course - blueprint reading, perhaps.

<p>

Next might come promotion to a multi-spindle machine; then a course in machine
tool operation; then a simple milling machine; then a course in measurement
techniques (and you got to keep the micrometer and the height gauge).  Soon
there was a little workshop around the employee; he put the parts in
appropriate jigs - and could get awards for suggesting tooling improvements -
set up his machine or machines, ran the pieces, inspected the work on his
little surface plate, and asked for the next batch.  Not at all
coincidentally, IBM had no unions whatsoever.

<p>

Those who didn't take courses didn't rise.  And, just as in the sales force
word on white shirts and striped ties soon spread among recruits, so shop
people soon discovered the advantages of the IBM education program.  Out in
the field it was more difficult, but even there you could sign up for
correspondence courses in Business English or Principles of Accounting Machine
Operation.  World Headquarters was riddled with courses: released time, after
hours, recreational.

<p>

Didn't look too apposite for an astronomy Ph.D.  But I couldn't ask my young
people to do what I wasn't doing, so after much thought I signed up Dorothy
and me - yes, families were invited to many courses - for Social Dancing I.
We learned to tango in the second-floor IBM cafeteria at 590!

<p>

Toward the end of my hitch at the Lab I managed to break the barrier which
kept all but aspiring customer engineers out of the serious technical courses
which described the innards of the machines.  I took a course about the
magnificent 407 tabulator, and found it very broadening.  One or two of the
senior youngsters did the same - Eric Hankam of course, and Stanley Rothman,
who was to come down to Washington with me in 1950.

<p>

Before I leave these small tents behind, I'm going to write just a little
about the courses we gave - that is, at Columbia.  These were all part of the
regular university curriculum, listed in the appropriate catalogs - we had our
own special one also - and open to any student with the prerequisites and the
money.  We did however encourage our own juniors on 116th Street and at the
SSEC to attend as auditors if they did not want to sign up for credit.  I
vaguely remember that Eckert made arrangements to have IBM pay tuition in the
for-credit case, but that there were no takers from downtown; the pressures of
SSEC operation were too great.  But almost everybody did a little auditing.

<p>

Most of our offerings were unusual.  Thomas did a very good course in
theoretical physics, in which he was a world authority.  I did a celestial
mechanics course one year; it was really a m?lange of spherical trig,
practical and theoretical astronomy (meaning time and position determination,
and orbit computing), and brief mentions of planetary and satellite mechanics.

<p>

<a name="[-101-]"><font color="red">[-101-]</font></a>

None of my subtopics were taught anywhere else at Columbia; the astronomy
department was solid astrophysics.  And they were what was needed for
astronomy calculations.

<p>

Some years later I was asked to do a short piece for the Astronomical Journal,
the very staid professional publication for non-astrophysical astronomers like
Brouwer and Clemence and Herget and Eckert.  I suggested that with the missile
and space programs booming, there was a place for a master's degree level in
my kind of astronomy, and jobs going begging.  I was delighted to see summer
institutes start up almost immediately, and more carefully considered
curricula follow at several universities.  My once-around Columbia course
would have been just right to start those students off.

<p>

Most of our value as teachers, however, came from the computing courses.
Eckert gave a two-semester machine methods course, which featured hands-on
operation under Marjorie, Lillian and Eric; literally the only place in the
world where you could learn in the university milieu.  He didn't do much about
the Aberdeens, because they were not available out in the world.  And he
didn't know Pete Luhn's two machines apart.  But all the regular machines,
including the very newest, and prototypes - those were done very well.

<p>

I did numerical methods - classical interpolation and matrix arithmetic and
integration of differential equations.  Most of my examples, and assigned
exercises, were at desk calculator level, but I lectured from the point of
view of machine operation; in a sense, I did a Comrie.  This was one semester,
once a year, and Hilleth did an advanced course featuring partial differential
equation solutions and error propagation, every other year.

<p>

My classes were small; this was a very esoteric discipline indeed in the
Forties.  But I had interesting students, and not just the auditors like
Rothman and McClelland and Backus and Don Quarles.  One year I had an
experienced computer from Aberdeen, who could tell us stories about running
the Bell Labs Model V.  His name was Joe Harrison Junior.  Twenty years later
he was to take over the computer standards work under me at the Bureau of
Standards.

<p>

Another was Walter Ramshaw, who had worked during the war in naval
architecture.  At the end, although he was married, he decided to become a
scientist instead: an astronomer.  He took my two courses, and was beginning
to run out of money even though he had hardly started on his Ph.D.  Walt was
extremely good; I suggested he peel off into computing full time, perhaps
using his engineering background as well.  He disappeared; six years later he
surfaced as the number two computer man at Pratt and Whitney, and gave me a
terribly hard time as I struggled to get the first 704s for Generous Electric.
He was also one of the dozen or so founders of SHARE.

<p>

If By Havens had had the time, or if Lentz had had his doctorate, the
electronics courses at Columbia would have gotten a great shot in the arm.
But Havens already had the NORC bit in his teeth.  So it was my side of the
house that carried the teaching.  It went on into the Fifties, always as part
- but a small part - of the Columbia offerings.  The hands-on side of the
Machine Methods course was unique, not just because of the equipment but
because real use-'em-every-day men and women were running it.

<p>

I mentioned how IBM treated its young draftees during the war: attention to
the families, supplementary money, and so on.  One other thing was that
<a name="[-102-]"><font color="red">[-102-]</font></a>
they were all promised their jobs back, when things settled down.  IBM had
always used women, and was quickly able to recruit many more to fill in for
the missing males.  But it took the precaution to ask new female hires to
agree to leave after the war if they were married, to make extra room for the
returning heroes.  I didn't know this, of course, but woke up to it painfully
one day when Marj Herrick told me she had been given her cong?.

<p>

Wallace and I tried hard to get a waiver, because of course she was in a job
that didn't exist when the boys left, and that none of those returning could
immediately fill.  No soap; it was an edict from On High.  Marj wasn't too
upset; she and Jack were not very fond of New York, and unencumbered.  She was
snapped up quickly by Ken Arnold, a statistics professor at the University of
Wisconsin who was starting a punched card lab, with a machine methods course
contemplated.  Jack Herrick found a job in Madison and we staged a great
farewell party.  IBM made a mistake, and lost not only a good employee but
much standing with some important observers.

<p>

Two notes: Lillian had retired to married bliss in Brooklyn before Marj was
beheaded, and I asked Eleanor Krawitz, her second on the Aberdeens, to take
over as supervisor.  Ellie was attractive - an understatement, pointed up by
the Lab story about how she had stomped a visiting Swede who offered unwanted
attentions - and she had a steady boyfriend.  After the no-married-women
clause was revoked in IBM, there was a grand party to announce their marriage
- some years previously!

<p>

There was a woman executive in WHQ personnel, also attractive, who often
brought her "steady" to company affairs.  They were sitting next to us in the
Hall of Stuffed Birds when Dorothy got the giggles, for instance.  She was
part of the beheading action that caught Marj.  Many years later, long after
the edict was abolished, she died.  And of course it turned out she had been
married all the time.  Even Watson Senior, Emperor Of All He Surveyed, could
not prevail over True Love - or New York ingenuity!

While Dorothy and I were paddling and camping and driving around the country,
a new way of transferring knowledge about computing was taking shape.  In the
Thirties such knowledge was passed literally from hand to hand; almost nothing
was published - indeed, by the formal standards of the time, not much was
publishable.

<p>

There was a little college of astronomical computers, a little college of
statistical and actuarial computers, a tiny group of civil and mechanical
engineering computers.  Comrie and Eckert were deans of the first, R.A. Fisher
and T.N.E. Greville were familiar figures in the second, a pioneer named R.V.
Southwell had a few disciples in the third.  The members of each group knew
all the others in the group; corresponded, traded a few reprints.  The day of
the intercontinental telephone call, let alone of electronic mail, had not
dawned.  Only an occasional major figure like Comrie knew of the existence of
other colleges.

<p>

There were people who needed to do a lot of X-ray diffraction calculations,
and people who did airplane wing and turbine bucket shapes, and others in
special disciplines like lens design.  The slide rule manufacturers and the
comptometer and desk calculator salesmen did not pull them together; I
remember with what sad amusement Maxwell and I flipped through a table of trig
functions given us pridefully by one of the latter.  But, as in many other
ways, IBM was different.

<p>

This stemmed more from Watson's enthusiasms than from the nature of his
customers.  Long before scientific and technical applications were recognized
as a business area, T.J. was spreading the gospel of better accounting, better
bank operation, more use of his machines in schools and hospitals.  If he
sponsored business arithmetic and typing courses - yes, and tango classes -
for his office people, and insisted that factory hires learn to read
blueprints, you could be sure he would impinge on the customers.

<p>
<a name="[-106-]"><font color="red">[-106-]</font></a>

This was originally done by the Education Department, although the lack of a
formal organization chart made it simple for T.J. to make special assignments.
The little gang that put out THINK, IBM's prestige publication, and the
various internal editions of BUSINESS MACHINES, could print special
publications, or something like the retouched SSEC brochure; a young engineer
who had realized that customer contact was required for advancement in the
company could edit POINTERS; the housekeeping departments could put the
Endicott Homestead and the country club facilities at the disposal of a
customer group.

<p>

By the late Thirties a pattern of customer conferences had developed.  I have
a rather primitive printed proceedings from a 1940 statistics meeting, for
instance, jointly sponsored by the Psychometric Society, and including a paper
from the man at Michigan, Paul Dwyer, whose punched card installation Maxwell
had ignored.

<p>

Not much could be done during the war; everybody was madly busy, and there was
travel restriction and rationing.  But the machinery was kept oiled and ready.
In early 1946 Wallace coolly informed me I should think up something to talk
about for a Research Forum, a follow-on to the 1940 conference, to be held in
August at what was still called the IBM School, in Endicott.  I overshot the
mark somewhat - the 1946 meeting was slightly less technical than the 1940 one
- and did "Harmonic Analysis by the Use of Progressive Digiting."  Wallace
described the facilities of the Watson Lab (the SSEC was still under wraps, of
course), and was more popular.

<p>

There was a 1947 "Educational" Research Forum at which Eckert spoke.  The
proceedings were a little more attractive, although still in paper covers.
Support was not a problem; what our computer friends needed was content.

<p>

We looked around.  There were two or three dozen punched card shops doing
technical calculations.  All used IBM equipment; the round-hole boys
(Remington Rand) weren't in it, and anyhow didn't put on customer "classes,"
as the IBM Education Department unfortunately insisted on calling even the
most scientific conferences.  I called around, and wrote a few letters: the
Naval Observatory, the Bureau of Standards (where the WPA Math Tables Project
had alighted after the Depression was swept away), Aberdeen and Dahlgren, the
Census, two or three tin airplane companies, General Electric; Paul Herget.

<p>

Looking back, I'm amused to remember I didn't use the salesman network; these
people had all been in direct contact with us at 116th Street.  If I had
realized then how power flowed inside the company, I would have invited each
outfit through its Friendly Local IBM Representative; as it turned out, many
of the men and women who came and gave papers, brought their salesmen with
them - they knew how the company worked, even if I didn't!

<p>

I was sort of the program chairman.  Eckert was sort of the general chairman.
John McPherson was sort of headquarters representative, although somebody
gummy gave the address of welcome.  The group - about eighty, including us
company types from New York - were put up at the lovely IBM Homestead, at the
junction of the two 18-hole IBM golf courses, and not far from the IBM Country
Club.  Transportation was provided by IBM busses to the IBM Education
Building, which had a giant brass THINK sign over the door, featured in the
formal portrait of the class taken on the steps by the IBM
<a name="[-107-]"><font color="red">[-107-]</font></a>
photographer and printed in the next issues of the IBM Endicott and IBM
Headquarters BUSINESS MACHINES.  There was a tour of the IBM Research
Laboratory.

<p>

When I first began going to Japan in 1960, I looked at all the company
insignias and remembered the Endicott ambience.  Japan was (and is) a very
IBM-like country.  In 1947 in Endicott, the IBM label and the THINK signs and
the standard portrait of Mr. Watson were everywhere.  And yes, there was a
company songbook - but unlike Japan, only the sales classes and the Hundred
Percent Club members had to sing.  There was an IBM symphony too, which
T.J. had commissioned between the inventors' portraits and the ceramics
collection, but nobody had to play it.

<p>

Even though they were scientists and engineers, the customers were impressed.
And they were also impressed by the handsome decor and the excellent meals at
the Homestead, and even by the malted milks served instead of nightcaps.  They
were restive at welcoming speeches, and not too excited by machine
descriptions and lab tours; most of them had private lines into one company
area or another: Los Alamos and RAND Corporation types directly, GE and
airplane company types via their salesmen.

<p>

This 1948 conference was the IBM interface between the pre-war and the
post-war - the pre-ENIAC and the post-ENIAC - computing experts.  Almost all
the papers were about the use of standard electromechanical IBM punched card
machines, but the ones by oldsters like Gertrude Blanch signaled the last
appearance of such people on the scene; they tended to have good pre-war
degrees in mathematics, and to do pre-war tasks like table making, or
statistics.

<p>

The newcomers had degrees in physics or aeronautical engineering, or
frequently none at all.  They were trying to do hard science, or design
airplane structures; they were impatiently waiting for time on the SSEC, or
delivery of new IBM equipment, or access to the electronic gear their private
lines into Endicott and Poughkeepsie promised them.  The old IBM sales
apparatus had pretty much ignored the pre-war group; a new apparatus was not
yet in place to handle the post-war group, unless you count our amateur
efforts at the Watson Lab.

<p>

At Lockheed Burbank, there had been a very strong wartime computing shop
revolving around an entrepreneurial type named Ward Beeman and a technical
type named William D. Bell.  Bill came to the Endicott conference, and told us
that the group had split off from Lockheed, taken the applicable IBM machines,
and formed a technical service company called Telecomputing.  They had brought
with them a contract from Lockheed to continue doing engineering computations,
but were free to take on other work.  Because the IBM equipment was rented, no
large capital investment was needed, only a certain amount of confidence in
their viability by the local IBM sales office.  It was the first American
enterprise of its sort, and preceded on the wider scene only by Comrie's
Scientific Computing Service Limited in London.

<p>

Bill Bell was a fine example of the new breed.  He was a handsome Californian,
with a handsome California wife named Max and two handsome blond California
sons (one of whom graduated from Hollywood High, and shortly thereafter turned
out not to be able to read).  Bill himself had
<a name="[-108-]"><font color="red">[-108-]</font></a>
no degree; he had worked at an
assortment of California-type jobs, including some in or near the movie
industry.  He was a good swimmer, a fine horseman, and a professional-class
photographer.

<p>

He had worked himself up through non-scientific punched card operation into
the computing group, which was then doing simple stuff like weight and balance
control, and getting ready to go into structures calculations; aerodynamics
was not yet feasible.  He had taught himself the math he needed, including
calculus and matrix arithmetic; knew little formal numerical analysis, but all
that tin airplanes needed - engineers who had trusted their slide rules
worried about loss of accuracy in long strings of IBM calculations, and Bill
handled this by perturbing the input data slightly and watching how much the
answers were affected.

<p>

He became famous among his late-Forties peers as a demon board-wirer.  He was
the father of the so-called General Purpose Board, which first out-Hergetted
Herget on 601s and 602As, then in 1949 was redone for the 604, and in 1950 and
1951 was redone again for the two models of the IBM Card-Programmed
Calculator, which I haven't said much about yet.  These boards, packed with
plugwires and split wires and connectors (and illegal germanium diodes, which
had to be concealed from all but the most-trusted customer engineers, whose
jobs were at risk if their IBM managers found out), did whole sequences of
arithmetic, and in later versions even did primitive floating point.

<p>

Telecomputing - at least the business side - didn't want copies made of these
confections.  But like the atom bomb, the big secret was that anything that
complex could be made to work at all.  I don't think there was a single man or
woman in the regular IBM who had ever wired such things, although the Aberdeen
boards at the Watson Lab were just as complicated, and twice as big.  The
skill spread.

<p>

Parenthetically, Telecomputing did very well for several years, until Beeman
and others took the profits from Bill Bell's operations and went into the
hardware business.  In other places I have mentioned a wonderful point plotter
that counted the lines on graph paper; they also built a line of chart and
film readers which punched digitized readings into cards.  In the end that
part of the business was bought out (the name survived because it was so
attractive), and Bill's computing services became the Mellonics Division of
Litton.

<p>

At Douglas Santa Monica an even more unusual sequence evolved.  Back in 1934
or so, a California astronomer of Maxwell's generation had published some
applications of Comrie's subtabulation procedures in, of all places, the Lick
Observatory Bulletin.  You would expect only the Grosches and Maxwells and
Cunninghams and Hergets and Eckerts and Comries to read such stuff.  But
somehow this man, Dr. Ernest Clare Bower, was brought into wartime Douglas and
turned loose in their punched card room.  If it had been Cunningham, for
instance, remarkable things might have happened; with Bower, it didn't work.

<p>

But running a sorter in that shop was a hulking operator named John R. Lowe.
He had had a really rough childhood and a terrible education, had been on the
road for a while, had had an accident which left him with an artificial leg -
and draft-proof.  He saw what Bower could be doing with the IBM
<a name="[-109-]"><font color="red">[-109-]</font></a>
machines if he would forget astronomy and think about the airplane business.
By 1947, John was in charge of a special group in Santa Monica almost as large
as the one at Lockheed.  Like Bill Bell, he taught himself the mathematics he
needed, and after the war recruited youngsters who had still more.  And, at
least as important as his own accomplishments in Santa Monica, he brought
along computing facilities at two other Douglas locations, El Segundo and Long
Beach, and trained a good number of younger experts who fanned out over the
aerospace community.  The best known, still active in computing today, was
Chuck Baker.

<p>

There had been an advanced planning activity at Douglas with connections to
General Hap Arnold of the Army Air Force.  It was split off and separately
funded as the Rand Corporation (Research And No Development, it was rumored).
When I first visited them they had moved their IBM machines to the basement of
a downtown Santa Monica bank.  The key figures were a forceful organizer named
Paul Armer, who will appear several times later in this book, and a very
strange mathematician named Cecil Hastings.  Cecil wrote the first New
Computer World hardcover book on numerical analysis, called THE INCOMPLETE
APPROXIMATOR: a collection of amazing formulas to replace functions like sines
and logarithms and probability functions - they used probabilities a lot at
Rand, and still do!

<p>

Most of his approximations were what are called rational functions: the ratio
of two polynomials.  These were computable by IBM machines from the 602 on,
whereas looking up the logarithms and such in a big punched card table was a
slow process even if you had hundreds of values to pull out each time.  Only
the SSEC really tackled the problem head on, until the end of the Forties.

<p>

You had to be very curly-brained indeed to dream up these strange beasts, and
Cecil certainly was that.  He did not have an automobile - in Los Angeles!  He
rode a bicycle to the beach, where he said he did his most creative thinking,
undistracted by the pre-Muscle Beach bodies.  In the end he married a
Chinese-American girl, moved to Hawaii, did a little consulting, and
disappeared.  As far as I know, he never bought a car.

<p>

Armer and Lowe were founders of SHARE.  Bill Bell might have been; he would
almost certainly have gotten one of the 704s.  But as the machines were
zooming onto the scene, he contracted multiple sclerosis, the Lou Gehrig
disease.  He managed nevertheless to produce the first hardcover book on
business data processing, which McGraw Hill published.  His was the first
death among the new computer people, and it was deeply regretted.

<p>

About a third of the attenders at the 1948 meeting, which I christened the
Scientific Computation Forum (the Education Department called it Customer
Administrative Class No. 446) were oldsters; the rest were newcomers.  My own
case was unusual; I was as young as the new breed, and using the very most
advanced equipment, but I also had a decade of desk calculator work and
numerical analysis behind me.  I was both the youngest of the old breed and a
leader of the new.

<p>

For the 1948 Forum I did what turned out to be my last numerical analysis
paper.  I had developed ways of condensing the large traditional printed math
tables down to a very few punched cards, starting with reciprocals back in
<a name="[-110-]"><font color="red">[-110-]</font></a>
1945 when IBM calculating punches could not divide, then moving to trig
functions for the Luhn relay machines and the SSEC, and then to fancier stuff
and a general formulation.  In the end, each card of my optimum interval
tables was a junior version of one of Cecil Hastings' approximations.

<p>

The difference was, I substituted routine punched card procedures for his
intimate knowledge of the target functions.  The paper in the proceeding gave
the details, but as I said earlier, the flood of cheap memory made the
technique obsolete by, oh, 1954.  Cecil's ingenuity was not transferable, and
disappeared with him; some parts of what I did survive in a tiny part of
present-day numerical analysis called spline theory.

<p>

The conference was a big success.  I edited the proceedings, and got IBM to
put them out in hard cover - a first for the company.  I seem to remember the
print order was a thousand (copies still survive; not many).  Plans were set
afoot for an annual event.

<p>

When I said this was a new way of transferring knowledge about computing I was
referring to repetitive meetings.  History buffs know about single meetings of
great importance to the art which date back before electronics: the Napier
Tercentenary celebration for instance.  And the influence of Johnnie von
Neumann spread from the Moore School summer conference in 1946.  IBM indeed
started the pattern of continuing meetings, but as you would expect it was
taken over by others, notably the professional societies.

<p>

In the fall of 1947 a small group of enthusiasts met in a room of the
chemistry building at Columbia.  The call was issued by Edmund C. Berkeley on
behalf of a half-dozen men he had brought together to start the world's first
computer society.  Ed was at that time an actuary at Prudential, and had
persuaded his company to order an Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation machine.
He was the author of the first computer book, GIANT BRAINS, and for many years
published COMPUTERS AND PEOPLE, the oldest popular journal in our field.  He
always lived in the future, and he served it well.

<p>

Eckert and I attended - he probably had arranged for the room.  So did Grace
Hopper.  There were perhaps sixty persons altogether.  We agreed to call the
society the Eastern Association for Computing Machinery.  In line with what
I've been saying, the first order of business was to plan a series of
meetings; the 1948 one was to be at Aberdeen, and I have mentioned how Johnnie
von Neumann ran one of the sessions.  The 1949 one was at Oak Ridge, in
Uffelman country.

<p>

Grace, at her death Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, U.S.N.R.(ret.), was the
most famous and the most respected woman in our field.  Of the charter members
at that Columbia meeting, she and Ed Berkeley (and I) contributed to the
outfit for decades, but only I survive as an active member of what is now
universally called ACM.  The name is unfortunate; since "Eastern" was dropped
repeated efforts have been made to change it to something about people rather
than machinery, but it's apparently too late.  When the Brits started their
outfit a decade later, they called it The British Computer Society, which is
better.

<p>

The two major engineering groups at the end of the Forties were the Committee
on Computing Devices of the AIEE, American Institute of Electrical Engineers,
and the Electronic Computers Committee of the IRE, Institute of Radio
Engineers.  They put on a joint Computer Conference in Philadelphia in
<a name="[-111-]"><font color="red">[-111-]</font></a>
December 1951, with ACM participation, and from this sprang a long series of
conferences and exhibits: the Eastern Joint/Western Joint/Spring Joint/Fall
Joint/National Computer Conferences, of which the 55th, the last successful
one, was held in Las Vegas in 1986.  ACM was a full member from 1952 on, the
parent AIEE and IRE societies merged in the Sixties, and DPMA, the Data
Processing Management Association, joined in the Seventies.

<p>

ACM began its big series of technical publications in the early Fifties, and
the other associations and special committees also began to publish.
Conference proceedings, usually a good deal less lavish than the IBM versions,
began to proliferate.  Everybody and his granddaughter wanted to have a
meeting; the IBM excitement was immense, and still growing.  If you count the
1940 IBM Forum as Number One, my 1948 Forum was Number Four, and four more
followed.

<p>

The Watsonians reached out expertly.  Where Wallace and I relied on our very
large circle of acquaintances, the sales people began to make lists; everybody
who had IBM equipment and was using it for anything technical, and everybody
who was thinking about getting same, was on them.  From the other end, the
fancy scientific types who had not been interested at the time of the ASCC or
ENIAC or SSEC dedications now saw the von Neumanns and Tellers and von Karmans
deeply involved, and began to accept invitations to Endicott and Poughkeepsie
they had brushed aside earlier.

<p>

As an example, the November 1949 meeting in Endicott attracted Herman Kahn,
Maria Mayer, Mina Rees, John Tukey, and von Neumann.  Tom Watson Junior opened
the sessions.  The big guns had begun to fire.  I remember the meeting for a
homely reason.  Tukey, who was a world-class statistics theorist, an important
consultant to the Bell Labs, and a father of both the Monte Carlo method and
the Fast Fourier Transform, liked to sit in the back of the Endicott classroom
and eat prunes.  Not having as much to do as at the 1948 conference, I sat
with him and shared the package.

<p>

Next week McPherson, who was now a vice president, had me on the carpet at
Galactic Headquarters.  Prunes were out, it appeared, even when shared with a
customer - the No Booze Rule came to mind.  I pointed out rather plaintively
that the whole shemozzle sprang from my 1948 Forum triumph.  "Herb," said
John,"it isn't enough to bat a thousand in IBM.  You must also make no
errors."  I remembered the poor devil who had rejiggered the WCs at the Watson
Lab.  It was the other side of the shiny IBM coin.

<p>

The next Endicott show was even more impressive to us working stiffs.  It had
what must have been the greatest percentage of the world's senior computer
users ever assembled in one place.  I have to justify that: I'm talking about
men and women who were actually running big problems on big machines at major
centers.  There were no big installations to speak of outside the United
States.  Inside the U.S. the one-off machines that were the features of the
non-IBM conferences - SEAC, the von Neumann machines, the ones being built at
universities and by big amateurish companies like Raytheon and General
Electric - were not running even on sample problems.  Remington Rand and its
Eckert-Mauchly and ERA offshoots were not yet competing.

<p>

There were 107 attenders, including six women.  There were papers by a dozen
men who already figure in my stories: Hamming, Yowell, Lowe,
<a name="[-112-]"><font color="red">[-112-]</font></a>
Hastings, Herget, Uffelman, Tukey, Bell, Ramshaw's boss, the new president of
ACM - and two women.  Five referred to my table-making scheme; I was
flattered.

<p>

Jack Belzer was there, and Marj Herrick's new boss, and two Canadians, and
fifteen IBMers - all professionals, not salesmen.  Not until the 701 big shots
came together in 1954 was there such a powerhouse of IBM users, but by then
there were big non-IBM machines working all over the world.

<p>

Which reminds me about conferences outside the U.S.  There were problems; the
British had a cadre of experts, including men who had been deeply inside the
American war effort and had contributed to the new electronics.  But as the
Forties computing scene developed on both sides of the Atlantic, the people
actually doing calculations were using desk calculators and differential
analyzers and punched card machines (the British said Hollerith).  For every
Comrie or Hartree or Southwell we had dozens - and a great deal more equipment
for them to use.

<p>

There were special cases like Turing, and we now know there were amazing early
electronic machines like Colossus hidden away.  But by and large, men and
women from Britain and the Continent who needed to learn from conferences,
came to ours.  The first good meetings in England and Australia did not begin
until about 1953, and the first truly international one was not held until
1959.  Many of us regretted it, especially the scientific types: wanted to see
our overseas friends functioning on their home territory.  In the end we did,
of course, but it took a while.

The Endicott engineers didn't worry much about the conferences being held up
and down the United States.  For one thing, the senior ones like Lake and
Hamilton and Luhn - well, Pete was in Poughkeepsie by 1948 - had all they
could handle in their own shops.  Each of them had a complete facility: office
space, a drafting area, a small machine shop and a fair-sized electronics lab,
and an assembly-and-test space.  Access was severely limited - officially,
only the administrative head of the laboratory, a few WHQ executives like
McPherson, and of course T.J. himself, could enter.

<p>

In reality a good deal of scuttlebutt was exchanged in the cafeteria, and via
salesmen and customers who sneaked in, and over iced tea at the Country Club.
But in theory, each inventor and/or project was separate.  There was a time
[1947] when the same Endicott building held four printer projects.  One was
developing the vertical typebar idea still further, one was doing a wheel
printer for what became the 407, one was doing a horizontal chain type which
later went into the 1400s, and one was experimenting with better wire matrix
componentry - initially for key punches and interpreters.  When Watson had a
free day he would tour the various facilities and give his verdict: stop,
continue, increase the effort, send it over to the factory.  Cynics claimed
that the verdict sometimes depended on the shape of the casing or the quality
of the paint.

<p>

My own view was different, and was reinforced by the fact that all of the
printer projects came into production.  IBM was sales dominated, and the
market was ravenous.  Almost anything had potential, and the Blue Suit Brigade
could sell it even if it didn't.  An engineering or production failure like
the 602 could occur, but the lab people and the factory people were very good
- and the sales force quickly whitewashed the rare blunder.

<p>
<a name="[-116-]"><font color="red">[-116-]</font></a>

To shift gears slightly, I have sharp memories of two scenes involving John
McPherson as a buffer for T.J.  I'm sure he did some of the Endicott tours for
Watson and made - well, recommended - decisions, but the two I am remembering
were in New York City.  Very early in the game, Pres Eckert and John Mauchly
wiggled out of their Moore School commitments; the story has been told
elsewhere, and frequently.  They started a small company and began to build a
dumb gadget called BINAC, and what was to become the UNIVAC I.  In a way that
would become very familiar in the Seventies and Eighties, they ran out of
money.  And their sponsor died.

<p>

They came to IBM.  I was not directly involved, but Eckert - Wallace, that is
- advised McPherson, and I advised Wallace, negatively.  Their application
certainly went to T.J., but I never heard the details.  Anyhow, there was a
meeting in the library of the Watson Lab, and John McPherson said no.  The two
hopefuls went from that session directly to Jim Rand's yacht in Florida,
according to folklore, and signed with Remington Rand.  The Old Man didn't
have a yacht (he used the Queen Mary), but he had a lot more of everything
else than Jim Rand.  He made a good decision, as usual.

<p>

The second scene was more fun.  I've mentioned how clever users like Bill Bell
wired up "illegal" plugboards which customer engineers were supposed to
report, for extirpation.  We were always told it was for patent reasons, which
I doubted and still doubt.  Well, much greater crimes were being committed
elsewhere in California.  Observing that IBM connected the older machines
together, notably summary punches to tabulators, wild-eyed users in the tin
airplane business tried connecting the new high-speed electronic boxes to the
more flexible older machines.

<p>

The first venture to do useful work was a 603/405 combination.  Northrop had
one of the space-heaters, which you remember did six-figure multiplications
only, but very fast.  They ran long plugwires between the simple 603 plugboard
and the complex 405 tabulator board, taking advantage of the fact that no
electronic signals were involved (they were all down inside the 603, and never
got to its plugboard).  Their customer engineer, who must have been deeply
involved, had to pretend to be shocked by all this, and reported it up through
his channels.  Orders came back down to, ah, terminate with extreme prejudice.

<p>

I was called down to McPherson's office.  He had visitors from Northrop:
George Fenn (who later gave a paper about the combo at my 1948 Forum), Bill
Woodbury (who soon came to work for IBM, and is remembered by old-timers as
the planner of a similar machine called the Wooden Wheel), and Greg Toben.
They were counter-attacking; instead of discontinuing the 603/405 experiment,
they asked IBM to build them a better machine using the forthcoming 604 and an
improved 403 tabulator, and to provide additional storage.  They wanted a few
hundred bytes (we said "positions" in those days); today, hungry customers beg
for gigabytes - same hunger, larger appetites!

<p>

McPherson looked down his nose at these importunates.  They should be happy
that IBM wasn't about to pull out its machines entirely, for gross violation
of the terms of the rental agreement; as for the suggested new combination,
certainly not.

<p>

Fenn looked grimly amused.  He produced a personal letter from Jack
<a name="[-117-]"><font color="red">[-117-]</font></a>
Northrop to Mr. Watson which pointed out that Northrop had several important
military contracts whose rapid completion was of tremendous importance to the
national security, and asked IBM to cooperate.  I gathered the letter was to
be carried upstairs that very day if McPherson's answer was unfavorable.

<p>

John got very red in the face.  I waited for the outburst.  Fenn And Co. had
been pretty crude; also I knew from my aerospace connections that Northrop was
a long way down on the totem pole compared to Convair, say, let alone Douglas
or Lockheed or Boeing.  Problem was, all customers were theoretically sacred -
and those like Fenn and Uffelman who threatened to put the bite directly on
The Old Man were more sacred than most.  The local salesman was supposed to
see that the bite was never put; no doubt an Anchorage transfer would be in
the Los Angeles office in-basket shortly.  Meanwhile&nbsp;...

<p>

Like all IBM offices John's had an easel.  As his choler faded he stepped over
to his and began drawing boxes.  In an hour we had the outline of what was to
be called the Model I Card-Programmed Calculator: an electronic computing box,
a flexible tabulator to read programs and data from cards and print answers,
storage in the tabulator and in extra electromechanical boxes.  Linked
together by tidy cables rather than with plugwires, needless to say.

<p>

It was a remarkable conference, and presaged a very popular system.  There was
another novel aspect; not only had a customer dragooned IBM into building a
new production machine, but it was agreed that documentation, and maintenance
training, should be furnished.  Small scale perhaps, but better than for the
603 - and far better than for the Aberdeen machines.  And as for me, I stored
away impressions of how to make IBM respond.

<p>

I inherited one of the last of the Model Is when I was hired into General
Electric [1952], but I was so interested in graduating immediately to a
familiar Model II that I hardly noticed the exact rental.  Somewhere around
$4,000 a month, I suppose, depending on how many boxes of auxiliary storage
you had, and on whether you needed to rent support machines or already had
them.  That means a system would have sold for $150,000 or $200,000 if the
option had existed.  And, to put it in today's perspective, both speed and
storage were less than those of a good end-of-the-Seventies hand-held
programmable calculator, selling for $500!

<p>

Fenn described his original lash-up, perhaps a little lavishly, as "comparable
in programming technique to current large computer design - a poor man's
ENIAC."  It programmed a lot easier than the original pre-Clippinger ENIAC; he
might better have said "a poor man's SSEC."  He could card-program
double-accuracy multiplication - decimal, of course, and not floating point -
in just over two seconds, and six-figure square roots in one minute; trick
wiring on the 603 board was not possible.  But he was doing vibration
calculations and planning on trying some aerodynamics, in 1948!

<p>

About this time an important new figure and a new team came onto the field in
IBM.  I've said that a post-war sales apparatus was not in place to handle
newcomers like Bell and Fenn.  I should have moved into the gap.  I had a
steady flow of importunate visitors at the Watson Lab, and was in demand as a
speaker for informal groups, who wanted to get into IBM-style computing.

<p>

Sometimes an alert salesman was involved, or the potential customer wanted to
bypass a dull IBM local office, but the link to the chain of command
<a name="[-118-]"><font color="red">[-118-]</font></a>
that produced special gadgets or fast delivery was feeble.  I could have
strengthened it.  I wanted very much to rise in the company, but had not
purged myself sufficiently of research and teaching.  And my wife Dorothy
really hoped I would go back to astronomy, or at least be an Eckert and do
some major celestial mechanics on the machines I had such wonderful access to.

<p>

Hilleth Thomas was delighted to do his physics, and have a Columbia graduate
student or two.  Eckert had the IBM countryside spread out before him, and
chose to ignore it whenever he could.  He wanted to do research, and he did;
if there had been a Nobel prize in astronomy he and his confreres Dirk Brouwer
at Yale and Gerald Clemence at the Naval Observatory would have won it for the
tremendous contributions they made to our exact knowledge of the motion of the
Moon and the planets, using the SSEC and later IBM equipment.

<p>

An example: Wallace rummaged through post-war IBM and found Richard Bennett,
the customer engineer who had made Belzer's Air Almanac master sheets possible
back in 1941.  He brought Dick to the Watson Lab, partly to help with the
Aberdeens when they arrived, but mostly to build a photoelectric reader for
the huge glass plates that came out of the Yale astrographic program.  The
star images to be measured were delicate little things by 1946 standards, and
John Lentz was hard put to it to devise the electronics.  The gigantic
measuring engine, with precision screws two inches in diameter, was loaned by
Yale; John put a rotating beamsplitter on the reading microscope, picked off X
and Y signals, and with them ran delicate servo motors that improved the
settings.

<p>

The initial setting was made from a punched card deck, one star to a card, and
the final settings were punched on the same card.  Further work on standard
IBM machines at Yale produced the star coordinates for publication.  This
monster filled a whole room in the first basement at the Lab - I've neglected
to say that "huge glass plates" meant about thirty inches square and a third
of an inch thick.  It was one of the exhibits on T.J.'s tour of the Watson
Lab, and I suspect it confirmed his realization that Eckert was an astronomer
first and an asset to IBM sales efforts very far down the list.

<p>

The new player appeared.  He was Dr. Cuthbert C. Hurd, who had come to my 1948
Endicott Forum from Oak Ridge.  He had nothing to do with Uffelman; was head
of a small statistical group over on the Union Carbide side, and had access to
IBM equipment there.  Now IBM never hired anyone away from a customer - or so
they told people who wanted to be hired away!  But men like Eckert and Hurd
popped up through special trapdoors.

<p>

Hurd was brought in to head a brand new Applied Science Department, which
meant that while he did not capture the Watson Lab or the SSEC, he did take
over the Endicott conferences.  He and the group of youngsters he quickly put
together were exactly what was needed to handle the special customers and the
special machines like the CPC, as we had begun to call the Card-Programmed
Calculator.  He himself didn't know much about hotshot computing, but the men
and women he acquired from Seeber certainly did, and his new hires included
one of Thomas' brightest students, John Sheldon.

<p>

Soon that triage that Eckert and I had performed for three years was being
done by Hurd and his staff, and very differently.  Problems went to the SSEC
<a name="[-119-]"><font color="red">[-119-]</font></a>
if they were very large, and either had good public relations value for IBM or
were submitted by a rich sponsor like GE; the value to world science which had
moved Eckert and Thomas, and to a lesser extent Rex Seeber and me, no longer
counted heavily.

<p>

Customers or potential customers certified by their Friendly Local Sales
Representative were encouraged to order CPCs or whatever, and Hurd's senior
people would help.  If the customer had only a single problem, the Applied
Science Department soon had a technical service arm set up on 56th Street to
handle the business; it was run at first by Sheldon, and used the youngsters
from the SSEC.  If the prospects were patted down and found to have no money,
the glories of IBM's Watson Laboratory were paraded.  And the fairly large cut
of problems that formerly was allowed to die in a quiet corner, dwindled to
almost nothing.  All, or almost all, was grist if it came anywhere near the
Applied Science mill.

<p>

I was green with envy on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and livid on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.  Indeed, it was very different from Wallace's lunar theory, and
great lunches at the Faculty Club.  But it was clearly needed.  There were
hundreds, and soon thousands, of computing centers waiting to be born.  The
wave of the future embarrassed Eckert - probably it is not too cruel to say,
much as I admired him then and remember him warmly now, that the wave annoyed
him.  Celestial mechanics moves very slowly; it is ironic that Wallace,
wanting to speed it up a little, helped open the floodgates for this enormous
torrent of change.  He was too sturdy a rock to be swept away, but the flood
washed over him and left the little 116th Street Watson Laboratory behind.

<p>

After I left [1951] there was a quiet time.  Then another force arose in IBM;
call it laboratory science - physics and chemistry and such.  It also was pure
science, but not Pure Science.  In the Sixties and Seventies IBM made
earthshaking investments: built big research laboratories in several
countries.  Before that, and especially before Yorktown Heights was planned,
the original Watson Lab was moved to a much larger building at 612 West 115th
Street, and the instruction at Columbia and for customers, in machine methods
and numerical analysis and so on, was subordinated to bench science.

<p>

Havens had moved out to nearby quarters to build his NORC.  Eckert and his
little band of assistants - Becky Jones, Ken Clark, George Samson - were in
titular charge.  But the novelty of computing was gone, and when the SSEC was
torn out of WHQ to make way for a production machine ten times as powerful
[1952], the old Watson Lab era ended.  The building on 115th Street drew
scientists who did not want to work in Westchester, but it was shut down when
the post-Watson-Senior rigidities of a giant company dictated.  Wallace
retired in 1967, kept on with his research of course, and died in 1971.  He
and Comrie had revolutionized user perspectives, just as electronics had
revolutionized the hardware.  I remember him fondly.

<p>

About the new player: Hurd was a natural executive.  He hired excellent men
and women, and he delegated.  He was an empire builder - the exact opposite of
Wallace Eckert.  He mixed easily with the McPhersons and the Birkenstocks, and
with Tom Watson Junior.  He was great with the customers, except for a few
real toughies.  I've said in a hundred speeches that the supreme art of IBM
salesmanship is to convince the customer that the dumb
<a name="[-120-]"><font color="red">[-120-]</font></a>
hardware and software the salesman is forced to offer him is precisely what he
needs; Cuthbert was a master of the art.  And he didn't wear a beard!

<p>

He was not himself a computer user.  He certainly was not a machine designer.
He didn't see the wilder shores of the future.  But he saw where IBM could go
next, and which customers needed more advanced equipment.  And he worked far
better with the planners and engineers than I had, partly because he was down
inside World Headquarters where it all came together, and partly because he
had no component, no architecture, no programming method he wanted to push.  I
wanted - and still want, after more than thirty years - to invent a solution,
to convince my peers of its value, to lead the troops to victory.  Cuthbert
was looking for battles IBM could win - and he was careful not to get badly
shot up while looking, or on the battlefield.  I tried to warn the airplane
customers that floating point was dangerous; Cuthbert argued inside the
company for more CPC production.

<p>

Out in the world, there was competition.  Not much; we were just emerging from
the years of the von Neumann Constant: from any given moment to the delivery
of a finished computer is three years.  All the real work - what in the
Eighties we called number-crunching - was being done on 604s and CPCs, both in
heavy demand (and the latter in process of revision).  But there were orders
for Remington Rand machines; none of the big ones had been delivered yet, and
the one-off machines like BINAC were dreadful, but T.J. had been alerted.

<p>

And there was fighting again, in Korea [1950].  The Old Man had lost a little
of his vigor, but none of his patriotism; he started a Military Products
Division, and his troops fanned out.  The customers were eager.  The
electronics that had begun at MIT and surfaced in the 604 was blossoming in
several places in the company.  As the American difficulties in Korea mounted,
andWashington began to pump out funding, Hurd and his people took to the road.

<p>

They went to the lead customers - the ones who had several CPCs, and were
clamoring for better ones.  I knew about this from the men they visited in Los
Angeles and Schenectady; Hurd was careful not to involve me in the calls.
General Electric asked my advice, and I told them to get in line.  The
airplane boys were jostling for position.  Hurd soon had fifty expressions of
serious interest, half of them backed by letters of intent.  No machine
specification.  No price.  No delivery date.  But lots of customers!

<p>

Euphemisms abounded, then as now.  IBM would build a Defense Calculator, not a
Win-In-Korea Calculator, and certainly not a Knock-Out-Univac Calculator.  Tom
Watson Junior was the key executive; he could go to his father and speak
frankly: talk about General Macarthur's problems, and how Remington Rand
needed curbing.  He did, and came back with a big dollop of money from The Old
Man's shoebox.  Published accounts say $3 million, but that was just for
starters; the internal gossip said $25 million, and was current before the
first machines were delivered.  Of course both figures may be accurate;
remember I said in the chapter about the SSEC that the indirect costs of that
machine were never included, or even calculated.

<p>

Years later, when IBM was forced to begin selling its machines [1956], it
appeared that the selling price was around forty times the monthly rental.
The first internal guesses at the monthly rent for the Defense Calculator were
$8,000 or so; the amount I paid for Number Six was $15,000; the customers
<a name="[-121-]"><font color="red">[-121-]</font></a>
who stormed the citadel in 1954 to order 704s were told the Defense Calculator
rental should have been $30,000 a month, and would still not have turned a
profit.  That points to $1.2 million as the sale price and also the cost, or
$24 million for the program.

<p>

While Eckert was recruiting the three Watson Lab electronics engineers from
the MIT Radiation Lab, more conventional methods were bringing others from
Cambridge and Los Alamos and such, into major parts of IBM.  Watson had
decided to develop Poughkeepsie, which was making key punches and electric
typewriters, as the company center for electronics development and
manufacturing.  This was partly because there had been a good deal of
munitions production there during the war (Endicott was needed to pump out the
larger punched card machinery), and there was available space.

<p>

Also T.J. had a philosophy about locations.  He liked to go into towns like
Poughkeepsie and San Jose and Lexington, Kentucky where IBM would be a major
force.  Later I was to watch GE do the exact opposite; it had had its bellyful
of Schenectadys and Lynns and Eries, and wanted to go to places where it would
not yo-yo the community up and down.  The Old Man enjoyed powering the
upswings, and had ordered that there be no downswings.

<p>

When I began going up to the first engineering projects in Poughkeepsie from
the Watson Lab, to visit Pete Luhn and also to give informal courses in
numerical analysis, the taxi drivers who brought me from the New York Central
station invariably asked me how they could get jobs with "the IBM."  Which
reminds me, there was a clutch of employees who had to go up to Endicott
frequently, on the Lackawanna Railroad or via Robinson Airlines, who thought
it great that IBM was expanding into Poughkeepsie, because the train service
was so much better.

<p>

The bright young men there worked for Ralph Palmer, who had been a team leader
on the SSEC under Hamilton.  The Number Two was Jerry Haddad - Jerrier A., to
be precise - who had done the 604.  The systems architect was Nat Rochester,
who really had wanted to stay near Boston after his Radiation Lab days, but
worried about its attractiveness as a nuclear target; in those times no one
dreamed that Poughkeepsie would some day become high priority.  Then there
were Mort Astrahan and Buck Buchholz, I think also from MIT, and Clarence
Frizzel from Old IBM, and Max Femmer, and a dozen others.

<p>

Most of them were clustered around a project called the Tape-Processing
Machine, and a test bed for electrostatic storage called the Test Assembly.
You have to understand that no one had today's kind of magnetic tapes working
yet - Sam Alexander, who was building SEAC, the Standards Eastern Automatic
Calculator, in Washington, was trying to use magnetic wire, and Mauchly had
talked about metal tape for what was to be the UNIVAC I, as far back as 1948.

<p>

In spite of several years of effort, RCA had not been able to make a working
tool out of storage on the face of a special cathode ray tube.  Successes were
just being reported from a different attempt at MIT's WHIRLWIND.  And IBM was
behind its smaller competitors like ERA in the art of magnetic drums.  So the
company was not even sure of the componentry for the Defense Calculator, let
alone the system structure.

<p>
<a name="[-122-]"><font color="red">[-122-]</font></a>

The team and the Test Assembly were in a mansion away from the river and the
main plant.  It was part of the Kenyon Estate, and IBM had bought the property
in order to have room for a new laboratory and more engineering buildings.
After the lab went up across the road, the big house was remodelled as IBM
guest quarters.  But it was bulging at the seams with bright young electronics
engineers in 1951.  Many of them showed up at a plant classroom to hear me
talk about table lookup and the convergence of square root iterations, and my
kooky way of looking at number systems like biquinary and signed ternary.

<p>

Hurd had assigned Bill McClelland, whom he had recruited from the SSEC the
year before, and two or three other Applied Science types, to help with
programming development.  From reading the first hard-cover book on
programming techniques, an English contribution everybody called "Wilkes,
Wheeler and Gill," from informal exchanges at conferences, and from the
aquifer of brand new ideas that was flowing from MIT and Columbia and the
Moore School, Rochester and his crew knew that programming in machine
language, and with absolute addresses, was obsolete.  The next level of
sophistication was being established.  The New York contingent pitched in.

<p>

I was in "wait" mode - very unusual in those torrential times.  In fact, it
was a new thing for me; I had whizzed from my thesis to the Naval Observatory
to wartime optics to the Watson Lab without a break.  I could see that the
Defense Calculators were going to go to customers who were mostly very
different from the scientists we had seen at the SSEC and Columbia.  The
Applied Science youngsters understood them very well, but in the role of camp
followers of The Blue Suit Brigade, not as equals.  That meant, because of the
gentility expected of all IBM employees, they weren't practiced at saying no,
let alone "Hell no!"  I offered to simulate a Fenn-type customer; with a faint
shudder, I was accepted.  Not a formal reassignment, just frequent several-day
visits.

<p>

I had to stay at the Nelson House, a hotel whose sole distinction was that the
swizzle sticks in the Regatta Room were shaped like sculling oars.  Many, ah,
software conferences were held there, the Even After Work clause of the No
Booze Rule having been relaxed, especially if you had been back to work after
supper.  At the Kenyon Estate, I shared a tiny office converted from a maid's
room, and kept my papers in a file cabinet in the bathtub next door.  I made a
few design contributions, notably to an argument about whether to retain both
positive and negative zero, in the pure-binary number representation (simpler
souls wanted to sterilize the minus).  Somewhere about this time I also made a
major selling-type point, that the IDLE lights on many machines be replaced by
READY lights - and not red ones, either.

<p>

Nat Rochester had hand-written an operating manual, reproduced by Ozalid
machine.  It described the operations he hoped Palmer would let Haddad order
the engineers to build into the machine.  The next version was typed, and had
lost most of the TPM, Tape-Processing Machine, operations.  This came easy,
since these had been business oriented - for sorting, and so on - and the
engineers felt a little at sea.  The Defense Calculator was to have a fixed
length 36-bit word, and extra precision and floating point, dear to the hearts
of nuclear physicists and aerodynamics experts, were to be in sub-programs.  I
helped with that too.

<p>

<a name="[-123-]"><font color="red">[-123-]</font></a>

Today's youngsters really can't picture how we worked.  Not because of the
primitive software tools, not because there was no hardware yet to try
prototypes programs on, not because nobody had invented terminals - but
because there were no copy machines!  And if somebody writes a story like this
at the turn of the century, I suppose the equivalent remark will be made about
word processors.  As I said above, Ozalids!

<p>

When a gang went out to eat together - there was no dating, in spite of the
tempting array of Vassar girls just up the street - each man would keep a
mental total of his items.  When the bill came, you added tax but not tip and
put down your share.  If the pile added up perfectly, which it almost always
did, you added whatever tip you wanted.  If it did not, and postmortem
revealed a culprit, he had to pay the total tip.  I was the authority on
rounding errors.  Usually it turned out the waitress had goofed.  An innocent
pastime - and it took your mind off the food.

<p>

There were concentric rings of programming.  Right around the machine - or the
machine design, at the time I was involved - were small programs written in
pure binary, to persuade the ALU (arithmetic and logical unit; the heart of
what we now call the CPU) to eat punched cards and understand them.  Such
bootstrap operations are stored in read-only chips today in millions of small
machines, but electrostatic memory was far too small to waste in such fashion
in 1951, it woke up empty every day, and it twitched (in the Test Assembly
anyhow) when somebody turned on an air conditioner upstairs.

<p>

The plan was to start up with a blank memory, by flipping console switches
read one card into a corner of memory, transfer control to the first word in
that corner, and go.  I suppose Nat wrote the first one; the champion of the
art was to be FEJ, Floyd E. Johnston, whose meticulous handwork in 1952 was
shipped with the production machines.  Those so-called binary cards were a far
cry from the ones that went into regular punched card machines, or even the
CPCs.  The Defense Calculator regarded any card as 960 ones [punched holes]
and zeros, which on the startup cards were read as 24 binary words plus
ignored patterns.  What the inner ring of programs did they did with sets of
those 24 words, understood as commands.  You could tell binary cards easily by
the very large number of punches: an average of six per column, where one or
two per column was ordinary punched card code.

<p>

The next ring of programs got you out of pure binary into octal.  Nat and I
were purists, and tried to get the gang to say octonary, as in binary,
ternary, biquinary (the abacus code).  Alas, "decimal" filtered down past
nonary and won the day.  With octal input, you could not only write programs
usefully on coding sheets, which - shades of Maxwell - were being devised and
revised and discarded almost daily, but you could punch them on cards with an
ordinary keypunch, and reproduce and sort and collate and print with IBM's
standard machinery.  True to the shoemaker tradition, the crew was very short
of such gear, and I invited them all down to my smoothly-running shop on 116th
Street; no takers!

<p>

One of the binary programs in the first ring taught the Defense Calculator to
understand octal, of course.  And a small pack of octal program cards taught
it to work in assembly language, where the code for operations was
<a name="[-124-]"><font color="red">[-124-]</font></a>
alphabetic/mnemonic and the locations in memory were relative, and given in
decimal.  Other second-ring octal programs fired up the tapes and drums,
giving faster streams of data in and out.  Still others operated the card
punch and the line printer, which were also being architected by Rochester And
Co.  and designed for production by some of Haddad's troops by modifying
standard Endicott gear.

<p>

To break into the programming story for just a paragraph, this was one of the
IBM strengths.  While Pres Eckert and his crew were struggling to produce the
UNIVAC I (and with a considerable head start) they were having to design
everything; not just tape drives, but input typewriters and such.  They got no
advantage from round-hole cards, partly because there was no Watsonian
discipline to force cooperation from the curmudgeons in Norwalk, and partly
because the inflexibility of the mechanical Rem Rand equipment made
interaction with fancy electronics impossible.  The IBM machines, even the
older ones, were controlled electrically; sure, you couldn't hook up a sorter
to a tape drive, but you certainly could use almost all of the printer unit of
a tabulator, and pretty up the results very considerably by retaining the
plugboard and the paper controls.

<p>

When cards which were punched in octal or in assembly language became
re-usable - that is, needed to be run several times before being altered again
- a "permanent" first-ring binary card program converted them to binary-card
form.  These read in about ten times faster than the originals, and all
production software was later shipped that way [1953].

<p>

Quite a few second-ring programs were working when I began coming to the
Kenyon lab.  Bill McClelland and the Applied Science men were using assembly
language to try out stuff on the Test Assembly (no relation).  I wanted to try
a few things in the next ring of programming: in my case, multiple precision
(I seem to remember someone had already undertaken simple single-precision
floating point).  These programs would be too big to run on the Test Assembly,
which meant they were paper studies.  The machine would be modified a hundred
times before any of them could hope to be tried.  No matter; it showed
Rochester where there were lumps in his op codes, and he was not only willing
but anxious to be shown.  It was understood that everything, including all of
the first-ring and second-ring programs, would have to be rewritten for
production gear, and modified later besides; the euphemism "maintenance" would
not be invented for nearly fifteen years, but the idea was already accepted.

<p>

The 36-bit word size was probably unfortunate, and it most certainly stretched
the abilities of customer problem analysts and programming experts later.
When you chopped off a piece for the exponent (and sign) in floating point -
which in spite of my Jeremiads all the customers except maybe the
cryptologists insisted on using - there wasn't really enough left for accurate
matrix calculations.  Or astronomy, but I could already see before the design
was fully roughed out that not much of Wallace's stuff was ever going to run
on a Defense Calculator!  Anyhow, it was too late; looking back from the
Eighties, I guessed 48 bits would have been optimal; the 360/370 experience
showed us that 32 is not enough, and 64 would have been wasteful.

<p>

There was an important difference between the programming crew (and
<a name="[-125-]"><font color="red">[-125-]</font></a>
me, the simulated hardhat computing customer), the eager MIT electronics
group, the Applied Science and Pure Science youngsters back in New York, and
all the rest of the IBM apparatus.  Every single one of us assumed there was
infinite expansion ahead.  I saw small waves, and then large waves, and then
huge foaming torrents of new science and new technology: science fiction
coming to life.  The hardware group was perhaps a little more business minded:
they saw waves and waves of new machines.

<p>

At 590 and in Endicott, and even in the factory reaches of Poughkeepsie, it
was not at all obvious.  Most of the manufacturing people, most of the
planners and factory schedulers like George Richter, most of the salesmen -
and, not surprisingly, almost all of those subterranean beancounters - thought
the office machines were the way to go.  IBM had always followed T.J. into
special ventures like the Harvard ASCC with pride, but few of the sales force
or the top brass ever thought such stuff could be product lines like time
clocks or typewriters, let alone supplement or supplant the punched card
equipment.

<p>

There was no resistance to electronics, except perhaps from a few discomfited
customer engineers; the 604 was a salesman's dream.  The CPCs were a different
story; if an installation needed help, one of the Applied Science men or women
had to be called in.  The company had always had a small fleet of systems
"engineers" - frequently women, during WW II - who would wire difficult
plugboards.  But they were part of the local or regional sales teams, and
hence floated on the commercial currents.  Even after Hurd began to put
Applied Science reps out in the field (starting in Los Angeles in 1950 or
1951), they marched to a different drum than the systems bunch, and their
services tended to be demanded directly from WHQ by knowledgeable customers.

<p>

Everything turned on Mr. Watson.  When he said the CPC was a good thing (I
suppose he must have), it flourished.  If he had said no to the Defense
Calculator, as he might well have done if it had been called the Scientific
Computer or some such, IBM would not have surged over UNIVAC and ERA and the
small specialized companies that were springing up.  In the end it would have
been a major player, as Rem Rand and National Cash were.  But it would never
have towered over the information world as it did into the Nineties if it had
lingered in those profitable punched cards.

<p>

The stories about how the company got into commercial production of computers
tend to emphasize how heroic the Hurds and the Birkenstocks were, to have
persuaded Tom Junior and Tom Senior to make that $25 million dollar commitment
in 1950.  For me, though, the hero is The Old Man himself: 76, an imperial
figure secure on his throne, with an heir apparent trained and ready.  How
many men in that position would have taken such a confident stride into the
unknown?  And it wasn't luck; his track record at National Cash, his insights
in the early IBM days, his backing of research in the company and science and
the arts outside, his international successes tell us it was something much
deeper.

I left the Regatta Room and the rest of the Poughkeepsie ambience reluctantly.
The whole bunch, programmers and designers and engineers, and even the few
executives who impinged, were working together in great style.  We all felt
certain a huge success was in sight; the very speed of the current - yes,
Dorothy and I were still foldboating - was carrying us past the rocks in the
stream.

<p>

As one example on the hardware side, it was obvious that the simple storage
tube circuitry that went into the Test Assembly was out of the question for
the production machine.  But behind the arras somebody was dickering with two
remarkable Mancunians, F.C. Williams and T.M. Kilburn, and when the Defense
Calculator emerged as the 701, the Williams tube technology had been
mysteriously incorporated.

<p>

My waiting period was over, however, and I collected my much-coveted machine
from a swarm of hungry IBM salesmen and set out for Washington.  To explain
the mysteries in that sentence, I have to go back to "green with envy" in the
last chapter, and in connection with that to a changing perception of myself.
From childhood I had intended to be a researcher.  I had married a woman who
wanted me to be a researcher.  I had been steered by Maxwell, had admired
Comrie and Wallace Eckert and two of the three Great Vons.  I was surrounded
with the apparatus of intellectation: Columbia, the Watson Lab, the SSEC and
its probable successors.  I had the credentials, the experience, the
opportunity.  And I was not doing well.

<p>

I had worked up Jupiter VIII, blessings on it - and others were building on my
small success.  I had done the Kleine Planeten, and the little coterie of
orbit computers was impressed.  I had done a seminal investigation of a famous
lens system on the SSEC, told dozens of lens designers
<a name="[-128-]"><font color="red">[-128-]</font></a>
where their future lay, and turned the results over to Max Herzberger of Kodak
Research to exploit.

<p>

I was the father of a family of mathematical tables which, while themselves
only of temporary importance, could lead to years of approximation theory
research and publication, well suited to the rather circumscribed resources at
the Watson Lab.  And I had a very large and rapidly growing acquaintance among
the men and women around the world doing big computations - in fact, I was
advising many of them, and enjoying the process.

<p>

Note clues in those paragraphs: "told dozens of lens designers" and "advising
many of them." I had seen for some time that I was happiest when talking to
other people and advising them how to tackle problems, how to set up computing
facilities, how to find or train good youngsters.  Also I was impatient with
the way Eckert turned away from manifold opportunities, more frequent than
mine, to do the same - and at the same time to steer IBM through the rapids of
technological change.  He had done well, but I would have liked him to have
done a great deal more.

<p>

I was indeed envious of the rapid rise of Cuthbert Hurd.  He had taken away
"my" Endicott conferences with a twitch of his wrist, hired the best men at
the SSEC for Applied Science, cut me out of the Defense Calculator fishing
expeditions and from most contact with WHQ.  Clearly I had not been ready to
do what he was so suavely doing.  Not so clearly, but increasingly, I saw I
was not likely to be a von Neumann or a Feynman; even in the slower currents
of Wallace's celestial mechanics, it didn't look as though I was world-class.

<p>

I decided to leave the eddies of numerical analysis and celestial mechanics
behind, and paddle up stream toward management.  I wanted to stay in IBM;
already, although it was barely a billion-dollar corporation, I was completely
convinced of its importance in technology, and in the world of affairs.  But
while I had known for several years that the usual path for advancement in IBM
was through sales, I did not want to join the Blue Suit Brigade.  I stood to
attention very poorly, as my tiny confrontation with Watson Senior on 116th
Street showed, and while I had let McPherson chew me out over Tukey's box of
prunes, it had rankled for weeks.

<p>

I had been managing - well, directing, I guess - a service function at the
Watson Lab.  I did not have direct hire-and-fire capability, and there were no
profits to be made.  And, without explicit profit, there was little
opportunity for a financial payoff.  I could see the large salaries and
commissions on every side, and while I was not yet a Big Spender, I had
definite interests in becoming one - common in New York City.

<p>

John Sheldon and his group were turning away business on 56th Street; the SSEC
obviously could be a major money-maker if Eckert would turn a blind eye; the
market for computation was booming.  Outside IBM, there was the Comrie venture
in London, and Bill Bell's Telecomputing shop in Burbank.  I decided to start
a technical service bureau for IBM, but not under the direct control of the
formidable Cuthbert.  Location was quite obvious: Washington.  Dorothy and I
knew it well.  IBM was strong down there.  There was a huge market for
technical and scientific calculation in and near government, and the Feds were
moving too slowly to satisfy their needs internally.  And although I did not
want to be called a salesman, I knew enough about the art to
<a name="[-129-]"><font color="red">[-129-]</font></a>
realize you had to go out after the customers, and repeatedly, to generate
business.  Sitting snugly at Columbia or smugly at the SSEC and waiting for
government types to beg for your services was not the way to go.

<p>

Hurd was shipping work back to his shop as he encountered it, but the latter
was already near capacity, and when he wanted to expand he ran into space
problems - and into the sales people, who wanted to rent whole CPCs, not just
cream off single jobs which would reduce the pressure to start or expand a CPC
installation.  Also, not a minor point, the big commissions came from sales
(that is, rentals).  I did not understand the commission plan, but I resolved
early on to make sure my new venture paid salesmen handsomely, whether
Cuthbert's did or not.

<p>

I wrote up some notes, which unfortunately do not seem to have survived, and
sent them off to John McPherson.  I emphasized the unfulfilled opportunity,
especially in Washington, and pointed to the advent of the new model of the
Card-Programmed Calculator, CPC II, which was under design at the moment.  I
volunteered to provide a sophisticated private test of the machine, and
suggested that if IBM would give me the prototype, I could not only begin
using it profitably (unlike the Watson Lab), but could do so in advance of
the, ah, documentation.

<p>

Documentation - which was of course not the term I used in early 1950 - was to
be not just a simple operations manual, but a description of the tremendously
complex plugboards that would have to be wired for the two component machines
and shipped to the customers at each installation.  I pointed out that no
provision had been made in what I knew of the engineering plan, to have these
boards laid out and wired, let alone described.  I said that the men and women
at the SSEC were not interested in stepping down to the CPC (and hinted that
the Applied Science activity had kidnaped the likely ones anyhow).  I noted
that the 56th Street facility which had absorbed some of them was away over
its head with profitable business, did not have the floor space to put in an
additional machine and play games with it, and could not afford to give up its
CPC I.

<p>

There were three or four great Pure Science employees at the Watson Lab, I
said.  Some of them would not want to leave New York - I was thinking
wistfully of Ellie Krawitz (now Ellie Kolchin, since the marriage had been
happily revealed when IBM's baleful rule had been abrogated).  One of them,
Eric Hankam, was vital to continued instruction of IBM customers and
prospects.  But I could easily persuade one or two others to come with me if
authorized, and with their help could do the general-purpose boards and write
them up - while waiting for a full customer load.

<p>

Oh, I was persuasive.  And it was all true.  Problems were, first, that a
dozen CPC I customers were lined up for early delivery of one or more IIs
(more than a hundred were delivered before the 701 and especially the 650
shouldered them aside).  Second, I was intruding on Hurd's rapidly expanding
and well-thought-of department.  I had not said I would not work under him,
but the tone was obvious; I talked about Pure Science for a starter, and later
a new department of computing services to manage a network of similar outfits.
I intended to steal away John Sheldon And Co., although I knew better than to
say so.

<p>
<a name="[-130-]"><font color="red">[-130-]</font></a>

And third, Washington, then the fiefdom of a tough Watsonian veteran named Red
[Louis H.] LaMotte, showed no signs of wanting such a function, let alone one
run by a bearded nonconformist who had once publicly disagreed with The Old
Man - yes, such matters soon got around.  LaMotte had been king of IBM Federal
for some years, and was reputed to go horseback riding most mornings with the
Quartermaster General and such.  A year or two later he was made Vice
President of Sales for the whole IBM - arguably the Number Three job in the
company.  He retired in the Sixties, but still served on special IBM
committees; I saw him last in London two decades ago, and he looked as tough
as ever, although more gray than red.

<p>

I'll never remember to tell that story in the proper place, so I'll do it
here.  Sperry Univac was having a fancy customer luncheon at the Savoy [1972],
and had shipped me in from the Bureau of Standards to be the guest speaker.
IBM was also having a luncheon for their customers, also at the Savoy, also
that day.  With several company big shots in attendance, they had managed to
lay on the Duke of Kent.  But just two or three days before, the Duke of
Windsor had died, so Kent had to cancel.

<p>

My Univac host was delighted - with me too, I think - and sent me off
afterwards in his own car.  As the chauffeur turned up the road from the
Embankment, I saw a straggle of familiar senior IBM executives toiling uphill
on foot; leading the pack, straight-backed as ever, Red LaMotte!  I stopped my
car, leapt out and had a mad embrace with the old devil.  It was almost
exactly twenty years since he had fired me.

<p>

Back in 1950, nothing seemed to happen.  No one was angry.  No one said no,
not even McPherson, who was accustomed to saying no to me.  I had told Eckert
very little about my plan, just that I was trying to "work out a better way"
for the company to handle that kind of work.  I couldn't ask him to poke at
the system, nor did I think it likely he would be effective.  I decided to
look at the economics of the service business a little more closely.

<p>

One afternoon, sitting comfortably next to my trusty Marchant, I began to lay
out some ballpark figures on machine costs.  I had the rental prices of the
CPC I and the 604, and a pretty good idea of what the rental of the CPC II was
going to be.  I had the rentals of the 602A, the 602, the 601 for comparison.
Making very rough estimates indeed, I converted what I knew of costs of the
SSEC, the ASCC at Harvard, and the ENIAC, to monthly figures comparable to IBM
rentals.  Going further afield, I added unfinished machines like BINAC and the
MIT WHIRLWIND, and SEAC in Washington.  I had heard little rumors about our
Defense Calculator - this was almost a year before I showed up at the Kenyon
mansion - and I put in a number based on $10,000 a month rental, later revised
to $8,000, and then to $15,000.  Two years later I had added guesses at the
650 rental, and about UNIVAC I.

<p>

"Well," I thought, "what do we get for all this"? What these gadgets really
had to offer was speed; people were still cheap in 1950, and Comrie had told
me the economical way for his girls to do a multiplication was on a Brunsviga,
punching the result on a card to get back into Hollerith mode (as compared to
low utilization on a 601, he explained).  Speed for the kind of work I did
depended on multiply time; there were only a few divide operations by
comparison, and additions and subtractions were much faster.  The kind of
transfers of control that
<a name="[-131-]"><font color="red">[-131-]</font></a>
are so important (although even today not very
time-consuming) in sophisticated programs were free on four-address machines
like the SSEC, subsumed in the plugboard wiring on standard machines, and very
fast on WHIRLWIND and that ilk.  So I used multiply speed as my measure of
performance.

<p>

I plotted this all up on a casual piece of log paper, cost versus speed.  It
looked sort of linear.  I extended the baseline: added estimates for desk
calculator operation, electric and hand-cranked, and for logarithmic work,
and even for Crelle's tables and pencil-and-paper.  It still looked linear.  I
was about to draw a line on the sheet and go back to other work, when I
noticed that the probable slope was about one-half.  I drew a line with
precisely that slope, and it fitted the dozen or so points reasonably well.
"Ah," said I,"economy is as the square root of the speed"!  Grosch's Law was
born.

<p>

What I had been looking for was a tool to price computations in a technical
service bureau.  In order to be practical, especially with lower-end
techniques like Crelle, I had added in human costs and computer room
inefficiencies.  Thus, I got four cents as the cost of a multiplication on my
Marchant, assuming a hundred operations an hour, $350 a month for a diligent
clerk (1950!), and reasonable benefits and overhead and inefficiencies.  My
somewhat optimistic guess at the same operation on the
Defense-Calculator-to-be was a hundredth of a cent - I assumed good practice
would avoid floating point.  Wrong!

<p>

I went around for several years telling audiences of all sorts, from the
popular (Rotary) to the concerned but ill-informed (banking) to the
professional, about this observation.  When I published it in 1953 I had
enough chutzpah to call it a law.  It got a little mangled in repetition, and
especially when taken up by others.  At that time product planners were hungry
for guidance; they had new drums and printers and tape drives ready for
announcement as well as complete systems, a short list at best of competitive
pricing - and IBM was still only renting - and optimistic stories from the
engineers about speeds.  So Grosch's Law got used as a tool to derive prices
from those speed predictions, for computers and for peripherals.  A tape drive
four times as fast as last year's? Double the rental!

<p>

Moreover, when arguments occurred about whether to use the law in a fresh
situation, some innocent would plot up the newest announcements on his copy of
my curve and marvel at how well it fell on the half-slope line.  Confidence in
my insight built up - three cheers for self-fulfilling prophecies! In the
Sixties Ken Knight did a careful doctoral thesis on performance calculations
at Stanford, and hung medals all over The Law.  Even in the Eighties, computer
science professors who wouldn't know me if I came to their door with a begging
bowl, wrote complex papers about how the law holds within classes of
equipment, but not any longer across class boundaries (they're wrong; it
does).

<p>

I loved it - still love it.  There have been esoteric attempts to explain the
law; there is certainly something down inside the relationship, although
nothing deep-deep-deep like Newton or Shannon had.  I do an explanation
blithely: when the tall ships sailed in the China Trade, the young apprentices
had to be taught to go up into the rigging.  If they were too frightened, and
hung on with both hands, the sails didn't get worked.  If they were too eager,
<a name="[-132-]"><font color="red">[-132-]</font></a>
and took in or let out canvas with both hands, a gust of wind would drop them
to the deck or into the sea.  So they were told, "One hand for yourself and
one for the ship."

<p>

My theory is that when you give a programmer or a planner a big new dose of
speed or memory capacity, he uses some of it to play little games: to adopt a
fancier language or a more wasteful operating system, or to write an internal
package that would otherwise be bought outside.  And what is left of that
speed or capacity he puts at the disposal of his employer; sail does indeed
get worked.  With friendly audiences I usually concluded with a mildly
scatological formulation: "No matter how clever the hardware boys are, the
software boys will piss it away"!

<p>

That accounts for only an afternoon or two while I was waiting for a response
from 590.  I had other irons in the fire.  I had observed a few intrepid souls
begin to go the consulting route, usually after having advised their original
conservative managements to order a computer from Remington Rand, as Ed
Berkeley had done at Prudential, or to try to use a scientific machine like
the CPC for a business task.

<p>

Using a scientific machine was perfectly feasible, and the advice was taken at
Lockheed and, miraculously, at Lyons Tea Houses in England.  In very early
1954 the Naval Aviation Supply Office in Philadelphia put in a 701 to do
inventory control, well ahead of the business-oriented Univac that General
Electric installed in Louisville to do payroll.  The stuff that statisticians
or underwriters did in insurance companies was clearly understood and
documented, for instance - and simplicity itself compared to Los Alamos or
Hilleth Thomas physics, or tin airplane structures calculations.  What was
lacking in such companies was the kind of channel up to top management that
George Fenn and his buddies had obviously found in Northrop, or the mysterious
Dr. Thompson had opened in Lyons.

<p>

I decided that if I had to leave IBM to start a new venture, I would try the
consultant route first, and hope either to convert it to a solid operation or
use it as a springboard to someone else's installation.  I made a pass at
Metropolitan, because of its size, and drew a blank; there was no channel
upstairs yet, but a Cerberus type was lying in wait, to pick off intruders who
attempted to open one.  Next I tried MONY, Mutual of New York, mostly because
I liked the imagination they showed in building their new headquarters (...
"flashing white means snow").

<p>

I met with an assistant vice president who was interested in computers.  Yes,
he would be glad to look at a proposal, and to carry it further up in
management.  I went back to the apartment and began writing feverishly - not
that I was so anxious to leave IBM, or consult for MONY, but because something
was at last moving.  My idea was to make an investigation of available
equipment that could be matched to appropriate parts of insurance company
functions - I was careful to say it was too soon to dive deeply into the
policy files or even customer billing, though that would surely follow in a
few years.  I would recommend either a complete system like the IBM CPC, or
assembling components from the various small companies that were offering
drums and arithmetic units and the like.  I took the slim document down to my
contact.

<p>
<a name="[-133-]"><font color="red">[-133-]</font></a>

About two weeks later I got a call from Tom Junior's male secretary, whom I
knew slightly.  I was wanted on the 16th floor.  Tom was by this time
executive vice president, and being sharpened up for the IBM presidency
whenever T.J. got around to telling John Phillips, the incumbent, that he
should retire.  I was curious.  The secretary, Horace Post, was quite frank:
no, he didn't know what the boss wanted, but he was not happy with me.

<p>

Thomas John Watson Junior was not a stranger to me.  He had just turned 36,
four years older than I, and had not yet developed the lines in his handsome
face that would soon appear.  He was a big man, like his father - two or three
inches over six feet.  He was an expert pilot, and had had a genuinely
distinguished war record, with a good deal of dangerous flying into places
like Moscow.  Although I did not know it until later, he was a devoted
yachtsman - no, that's too mild; he was an expert and daring sailor.  In later
years he had been up in the Davis Strait and along Greenland, some of the most
dangerous water on earth.

<p>

When he got back to IBM [1946] he was assigned a territory in the New York
City office, and it included the Watson Laboratory.  Yes, during the period I
was finishing up the Los Alamos work at the 116th Street building, he was my
salesman.  Didn't last long; he got promoted right after making his first
sales quota, and attending the 1946 Hundred Percent Club.  But for a while, if
I needed ten boxes of punched cards for the shop, I would call his number and
place my order.

<p>

There were two differences compared to my previous salesman.  First of all, I
usually got Horace.  Tom indeed made genuine sales calls, and handled orders
for new machines and such, but his, ahem, secretary took care of minor items.
Second, while cards were still on allocation in early 1946, mine got printed
up very rapidly indeed, and if I asked for standard stock, it arrived
literally the next day, by taxi!

<p>

I also saw Tom a few times at the SSEC and at IBM celebrations, and presumed
on our rather remote prior connection to talk a little about the lab and the
computing milieu.  He was reported to have greatly enjoyed the story, quickly
recounted to him by Endicotters, about my adventure with Mr. Phillips.

<p>

I had made my first overnight visit to the beautiful Endicott Homestead, the
guest house near the Country Club.  As was the nice custom, the housekeeper
put me in the Watson Suite as a new senior employee.  When T.J., often with
his wife, came up to Endicott he used this elegant suite, with a porch
overlooking one golf course, and the most lavish bathroom I had ever seen in
my impoverished life.  When it was not so engaged, distinguished visitors or
other IBMers were given a chance to stay in it.

<p>

On my last day, the housekeeper asked me if I could leave the suite early; she
knew I was taking the late sleeper back to New York that night, but John
Phillips the IBM president was coming up in the afternoon.  "Of course," I
said.  That evening we all gathered for malted milk nightcaps in the Homestead
dining room.  I introduced myself to Mr. Phillips, and sat next to him at one
of the round tables.  Perhaps not choosing the most felicitous phrasing, I
told him how much I had enjoyed being in the Watson Suite.  "They worked the
old hot bed system on us, Mr. Phillips," I said.  There was a pregnant
silence.  "Carries
<a name="[-134-]"><font color="red">[-134-]</font></a>
me back to the railroad," he said.  Nice!  He had been a conductor on the Erie
when T.J. had spotted him, and hired him as his male secretary.

<p>

So I was not too ill at ease when I entered the sacred portals.  Didn't last
long, though; without preliminaries Tom threw my MONY proposal down in front
of me and demanded an explanation.  Turned out that it had indeed generated
interest at the insurance company, and had been passed around at the Board of
Directors - and one director was Tom Junior!!

<p>

Oy weh, as my Jewish friends would have said.  I told my story.  No, I didn't
want to leave IBM, but I had been unable to push my idea about the Washington
Technical Computing Bureau past the Headquarters staff (that was code for
McPherson and Hurd), and was looking for another route.  I made it clear I had
prepared the proposal outside office hours and so on - no mention was made of
when I made visits to the MONY assistant vice president.

<p>

"They told me about your Washington proposal yesterday," he said, indicating
he had been talking to Eckert and McPherson about whether to fire me out of
hand, or just string me up by the ankles and beat me with a sjambok.  He was
not very angry, but definitely not amused; gossip said he had a violent
temper, but in spite of the strains between us then and later, I never saw it.
He probably reserved it for failed salesmen, or adversaries over six foot two.

<p>

He took back the proposal.  I wonder if it is somewhere in the IBM historical
archive today; more likely he gave it back to MONY later.  I still have a copy
somewhere.  "Let me know by this time tomorrow whether you want to go down to
Washington for IBM.  If not, Dr. Eckert will discuss your departure with you."
No, no, no, I said.  "Just point me in the right direction; I have to arrange
for the CPC, and two or three people, and talk to someone down there about
space.  I wanted to do it - still want to do it."  Good, he said, dismissing
me.

<p>

Before the end of the week I had been promised the prototype CPC II, not yet
fully designed in Endicott, three unnamed juniors "from Pure or Applied
Science," a special customer engineer like Dick Bennett, and space in
Washington Federal "to be arranged with Mr. LaMotte at the proper time."

<p>

Indeed, the catch was timing.  This was the fall of 1950; I was still teaching
my numerical analysis class at Columbia.  The crucial decision about the
Defense Calculator project was about to be taken (if he had not been thus
occupied, Cuthbert Hurd would probably have expunged me single-handed).  The
CPC had to be finalized, and the prototype put through the shop.  Late spring
of 1951 was the earliest possible date to ship it to Washington.

<p>

This explains "wait mode." I had duties at the Watson Lab, but Wallace and I
knew my heart was no longer in them.  He was pleasant but disappointed; wanted
me to do what was best for me, but a little uncertain how he was to manage the
computing rooms and the visitors, and who to plug into my Columbia course in
1951.  Fortunately he did not have to deal with Mary Noble and the art
collections any more!

<p>

So as soon as my Columbia obligations permitted, I began going up to
Poughkeepsie to help with the Defense Calculator.  Often I would go on to
Endicott, to look at progress on the CPC II.  It was near Frank Hamilton's
engineering suite, although under different auspices; I used to drop in on
Frank, who was by now a valued friend, as relief after hassling the CPC crew.

<p>

He kidded me a lot about my frequent and unproductive visits, and I explained
about how anxious many
<a name="[-135-]"><font color="red">[-135-]</font></a>
West Coast customers were to steal away my prototype
machine.  In return he showed me a little of what he and Ernie Hughes, one of
the SSEC designers, were doing.  They were working on a drum system; today we
would call it a minicomputer.  When announced in mid-1953 it became the famous
IBM 650.

<p>

"I may have to come up here and sleep on the joggle board of the tabulator
[front shelf], when my baby gets near shipment," I said.  "My ticket from Tom
Junior is only good for so many rides, and then Cuthbert or North American or
whatever will throw me off the train." He said he wished that was all he had
to worry about (he was building his system around a big magnetic drum, and
hadn't been able to get a working surface on the drum).  Frank was an
optimist; I was an optimist.  Neither of us dreamed that two thousand of his
machines would be rented and sold.

<p>

Back in our Chelsea apartment Dorothy was facing her first IBM move.  We had
lots of time, and lots of help.  Mary Noble Smith heard I was going down to
Washington "for young Mr.  Watson"; those things got around World Headquarters
like lightning.  Why didn't I use the art movers, she said, meaning the
special company that had delivered the Syracuse ceramics collection and Isaac
Newton to the Watson Lab.  I guessed that the charges would be a great deal
more than Chelsea Movers, but I was warming up to the idea of travelling first
class.  Months later, when we asked for them, solemn little men who were
accustomed to handling Van Dycks for the Metropolitan Museum came to our place
and wrapped Dorothy's jelly glasses.  IBM!

<p>

I made a trip down to meet the great Red LaMotte.  He was abrupt with me - no
matter.  It was clear that he had never inverted a matrix in his life, and
wasn't planning to start in 1952.  I worked on him.  Yes, he knew about the
UNIVAC coming to Census.  Yes, he knew about the UNIVAC coming to the Pentagon
(he was amazed that a whiskered scientist in a sport jacket had heard about
such things).  Yes, a little publicity about the new IBM computing facility
that was coming to Washington might be helpful.

<p>

First he sent me to meet my putative boss, a smoothie from the Blue Suit
Brigade who ran the Washington Federal office.  There was a commercial office
also, and a card manufacturing plant of considerable size, and a Service
Bureau; everything reported to LaMotte.  Then he sent me to Bachrach for mug
shots - for walk-ins, a two-week wait; for IBM, same day appointment.  Then he
sent me over to the Service Bureau to meet Scottie, a charming but harried
ex-Britisher who had just moved his shop into midtown quarters on 19th Street
from the card factory.  Scottie was luxuriating in his first elbow room since
1940.  I told him I would need all his spare space: a separate machine room, a
library/conference room, an office nicer than his (which wasn't saying much),
and a ladies room for my, ah, staff - he had only men.  It had been great the
few weeks it lasted, said the poor guy.

<p>

Then LaMotte really got up steam.  "I have a surgeon friend," he said.  "His
daughters are getting ready for their debuts, so he has had to take a much
larger place for entertaining.  His wife has a little row house on Q Street
that they plan to come back to in three years or so.  Go and look at it; tell
the agent
<a name="[-136-]"><font color="red">[-136-]</font></a>
I sent you."  The place was exactly what we needed, and quite a step up from a
mud road in wartime Kensington.  But of course it was promised.

<p>

"No matter," said LaMotte gruffly.  Next week the agent mailed me the lease.
Then all we had to do was wait.

While Dorothy and I, and the jelly glasses, are metaphorically en route to our
miniature palace off Q Street, I must take time to explain how I had become
involved with the other two Vons, von Karman and von Braun.  The stories
revolve around my third professional society affiliation, the American Rocket
Society.

<p>

I had been encouraged to join the astronomers in 1939, and the optickers in
1942.  And in 1947 I became a charter member of the first computer society,
the Eastern Association for Computing Machinery (now ACM).  But in 1946,
before Brother Berkeley rallied us to the flag of ones and zeros, I had joined
the space enthusiasts.

<p>

I was in New York, where the ARS was getting free office space from ASME, the
mechanical engineers.  I was nicely supported by IBM.  I was not affiliated
with the contending proto-industrial forces in the rocket arena (about which
more later).  And I had served my time in celestial mechanics, one of the
underlying disciplines of space travel; doctorates were scarce, and highly
valued as camouflage by the backyard experimenters who were firing midget
rockets out on Long Island, and in deepest New Jersey.  I had studied the
literature - Verne, Wells, AMAZING STORIES, ASTOUNDING STORIES, and Ley and
Oberth and Hohmann, and the Goddard reports from New Mexico.

<p>

I started going to the monthly meetings, and reading the poor little magazine.
To do the rocketeers justice, however, I must point out that there was no
regular computer society publication until six or seven years later, while
ARS, the British Interplanetary Society, and the pre-war German association
all had at least quarterly journals in the Thirties!

<p>

Soon I met Billie Slade, the part-time paid secretary of ARS, Willy Ley,
<a name="[-140-]"><font color="red">[-140-]</font></a>
already a well-known science journalist, Ed Pendray, a public relations man
for Harry Guggenheim who had funneled the latter's support funding to Goddard
in the Thirties and early Forties, and Goddard's widow Esther.  The
experimenters included a dozen men who became famous post-Sputnik.  Wernher
von Braun had arrived in the U.S. and was about to join.  The academics, very
few in number, were mostly from aeronautical engineering.  One unusual figure
was an Andrew Haley, a Washington lawyer with considerable personal financial
resources and a great fondness for Yellowstone bourbon.

<p>

Andy was one of my three routes to von Karman.  To explain why requires a
little industrial history, leading from Cal Tech to General Tire.  Theodor von
Karman, the greatest name in theoretical aerodynamics worldwide, had emigrated
to the United States from Hungary in 1930, pre-Hitler, and ran the Guggenheim
(yes, same money) Aeronautical Laboratory in Pasadena.  He was much admired
and much trusted by the flyboys in the Army Air Corps, and as part of the Cal
Tech war effort was asked to take on the development of jet-assisted takeoff
devices - somewhat stimulated by the Doolittle attack on Tokyo, which entirely
depended on getting off from a short run, and also by other aircraft carrier
applications.

<p>

He set up a shop back in the hills above Altadena, and after a certain number
of unscheduled explosions began to produce JATO bottles.  The first test
pilot, Bill Gore, later became an ARS president; it was a very tightly knit
group, and small.

<p>

There had to be a corporation, and Karman turned to his personal lawyer, who
had been doing his will and worrying about the family estate back near
Budapest.  That was Andy Haley, who became the first president of what is now
Aerojet, and later arranged to sell it to General Tire and Rubber (for
novices, it might help if I point out that solid rockets, including the ones
on the ill-fated "Challenger", use a rubber-based propellant!)

<p>

A second route in to the great man was my friend Hans Kraft at GE Schenectady,
who had been a favored pupil of von Karman's in Germany.  This in turn
produced my first meeting with Karman, at the SSEC, when I took him on a tour
and explained what the big machine was going to do for Kraft.  His continuing
interest in fluid mechanics calculation after he returned to Cal Tech in the
late Forties encouraged the youngsters at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (which
is what his facility back in the hills had become) to be early and vigorous
computer users.  And that was my third route in to him.

<p>

He was a little gray owl of a man, but kinder than Johnnie von Neumann, whom
he knew well of course.  Johnnie had big warm liquid eyes, but there was ice
down underneath; Karman was more tolerant.  Kraft said he had been a wonderful
teacher.  When I took him through the SSEC in 1947 he was nearing seventy, but
still interested in my first impressions of the rocket people.  He was not
particularly responsive to the science fiction side of rocketry; unlike von
Braun, whom I had just met for the first time a few days before, he did not
want to ride one of his dragons to the Moon or Mars.

<p>

Both von Karman and von Neumann were deep-insight people; two tremendous
scientists.  Wernher von Braun was a super engineer, one of two I have met in
my lifetime, and like the other one, Gerry Neumann, also a terrific leader.
The two
<a name="[-141-]"><font color="red">[-141-]</font></a>
great scientist-mathematicians and the great engineer-leader - the
Great Vons, as I like to call them - all put their skills eagerly at the
disposal of the military.  You thought of this immediately in von Braun's
case, because of the V-2s.  But I look at it today rather differently.  Karman
and Neumann had other paths they could have followed; Cal Tech and Princeton
could have absorbed them again.  Wernher wanted to go to Mars; he had to build
monsters to get there, and he built them for Hitler and for Lyndon Johnson,
and would have built them for the Russians or the Chinese.  All three are
dead; from the Nineties, I empathize more with the spaceman.

<p>

Haley and von Karman represented a West Coast rocket enterprise.  There was
strong competition in the East, with a younger entrepreneur instead of the
shadowy Harry Guggenheim.  This was Laurence Rockefeller, who was backing
Reaction Motors in Far Jersey.  The two outfits sponsored ARS events, and paid
the expenses of ARS volunteers.  There were neutrals; I remember a director
from Linde Air Products who sported one of the very first synthetic star
sapphires, made in the Linde laboratories.  And I, as I rose rather rapidly in
the tiny organization: IBM supplied both sides, as did the liquid oxygen guys.

<p>

I got IBM to take a cheap advertisement in the ARS magazine.  I sweated on the
board of directors over our painful finances.  As a useful writer and speaker,
I helped Willie Ley and Ed Pendray on the PR side.  All of a sudden, I was
president - of about 2500 excited but impoverished enthusiasts.  It was a
strange feeling.  I was 33.  I was regarded as a fledgling astronomer.  I had
already risen to national program chairman for the Optical Society, but in
spite of nine years of membership was obviously only at the foot of that
rather specialized ladder.

<p>

I had made genuine research contributions in astronomy and optical design.  I
had never seen a rocket fired, let alone designed one.  Yet here I was, decked
out in my first dinner jacket, welcoming Washington big shots and
distinguished foreign visitors to our American Rocket Society annual meeting.
And ARS was already much larger than the astronomers, somewhat larger than the
optickers, and ten times as large as brand new ACM.  My, my - strange world!

<p>

Growth was the key, of course.  The astronomers are still very small.  There
are other optical groups now, and all of them together add up to only a few
thousand members.  The space gang grew and grew, took over the tin airplane
society, and today is the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,
with over forty thousand members.  And puny little ACM is now up to 80,000
bodies, has a budget of $40 million a year - and I've been president of that
too!

<p>

Well, ARS wasn't all Boards and banquets.  I cast about for ways of
legitimizing its wilder talents.  Publications looked like a self-supporting
possibility; I found an excellent editor at nearby Princeton, Martin
Summerfield, and he planned a JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ROCKET SOCIETY, the
forerunner of dozens of handsome periodicals now issued by the AIAA.  Somebody
- Ed Pendray, I guess - found a good printer who was used to technical
letterpress and to not being paid promptly, and we were off and running.

<p>

<a name="[-142-]"><font color="red">[-142-]</font></a>

The Brits had an Interplanetary Society, and it too had a publication which
wanted to grow into something technical.  Too soon - there was no missile
program in the U.K., and their tin airplane association, the Royal
Aeronautical Society, was soaking up all the advertising and all the
industrial support.  The president of the BIS the year I was head of the ARS
[1951] was Arthur Clarke, now world famous for his science fiction and his
movies, and chancellor of a university in Sri Lanka to boot.  We are still
good friends, and meet once or twice a decade on the lecture circuit - but I
have to get back to computing!

<p>

I had told some of the rocket story to McPherson, and when I met him, to
LaMotte.  John found it disagreeable, I think - undisciplined, which it surely
was.  LaMotte had an eye on the Washington agencies that were putting money
into missiles, and was anxious to support my contributions.  Perhaps more
important, my wife Dorothy thought it was exciting.  She felt much more at
home with the astronomers and the spectrographers, but she couldn't help
liking Andy Haley and Billie Slade, and besides, it was sort of a family
enterprise.

<p>

So was astronomy, and a worldwide family at that.  But it was old and staid,
and it took twenty years and a lot of night observing to really become an
insider.  Heber Curtis, the observatory director at Michigan who had been so
kind to me, was just such a one, but it had taken his whole lifetime.  Dorothy
marvelled that I had been clutched to the ARS bosom in four years.

<p>

We were a little ill-at-ease on the banquet circuit, and especially on the
dais, but IBM had polished both of us up better than we knew.  I was by this
time not only an eager ham, but an experienced one.  Dorothy bought some less
conservative evening dresses.

<p>

My little group of workers was assembling.  I had brought Stan Rothman from
the Watson Lab, and he had begun in Endicott to wire and test the general
purpose boards for the CPC II.  Stan was still a bachelor; had a good degree
in math from Yale, and was nearly finished with a master in mathematical
statistics from Columbia.  We laughed ruefully over his inability to write
well, or even to spell (although he later became author of a major early
social-implications book), and I planned to have someone help him when we got
to the stage of writing the documentation.  He was hoping it would be Libby
Lindberg, a very lovely blonde from the SSEC junior crew.

<p>

Libby was about to become engaged, and in spite of Stan's dark masculine
attractions was not much at risk.  I remember faintly that her fianc? was
already Washington-bound; anyhow, there was no relocation problem.  She
thought my struggles to provide her with a WC were ridiculous; was perfectly
willing to go unisex.  But I remembered that IBM vice president in 1946.

<p>

The third recruit was John Mayhew, from one of Hurd's enterprises.  He had
been in the wind tunnel business in Texas, and found New York a bit much.  He
didn't mind the dress code or the No Booze Rule, and in fact was extremely
conservative by nature.  It was the subway hustle and the discourtesies that
got to him; he hoped the Washington pace would be more civilized.  I figured
he would be my analyst while Stan was struggling with the new machines.

<p>

I had been very anxious to get a special customer engineer.  With a machine so
new there were no manuals, for operations or for maintenance, and with Rothman
needing all sorts of inside information about timing to
<a name="[-143-]"><font color="red">[-143-]</font></a>
make his monstrous plugboards work, I was sure we needed someone unusual.
Well, one was forthcoming.  His name was Carl Southard, and he was already
lightly attached to LaMotte's empire when I hove in sight.

<p>

I couldn't believe him when we met.  An IBMer?  A favorite of Red LaMotte's?
He was messy; his shirt was indeed white, but only for an hour or two each
morning.  He pulled his tie loose at the first difficulty.  He was ovoid
rather than IBM tall-and-lean.  And he always had a bedraggled cigarette
hanging from the corner of his mouth.

<p>

But he was good.  Boy, was he good!  He would hang over the printer, his
eyelids at half mast, ashes falling into the type bars, and listen to Stan or
John, or occasionally Libby or me, describe a problem.  He would ask dumb
questions in a southern, or Southard, accent.  You wondered, at first anyhow,
if he had had a bad night and was falling asleep.  He would mutter to himself.
Then he would open up a relay gate, or a rack of tube assemblies in the 605,
and twiddle something, or replace a unit.  That was it.  Oh, he did hit really
tough ones once in a while.  But even Dick Bennett back at the Watson Lab
couldn't touch him for sheer, oh, insight.

<p>

Carl didn't want to go upstairs into design engineering.  He didn't like the
atmosphere, and he was used to Washington.  He went to Endicott for me and
helped wire the prototype machine, and marked up a private set of blueprints
for use later.  I was afraid I'd lose him; in fact, toward the end of his
Endicott visits, when I saw how good he was, I worried more about losing him
than losing the CPC.  But it all worked out.  The machine was shipped; Carl
understood it better than the designers; Stan was well into the plugboards.

<p>

Scottie was remodelling the back of the 19th Street building for me.  No
beancounting; someone was getting cost statements, but it wasn't me.  However,
when my crew began assembling, he started to hand me payroll printouts for
them.  I was not satisfied.  Inquiry revealed they were actually being
generated on his service bureau equipment, in the front of "our" building,
from cards punched up at Federal two blocks away.  I had Libby punch them
instead, from my data, which got my guys (and me) off Scottie's timeclock.  I
wrote a note to my boss, copy to LaMotte, saying that "I was doing my own
payroll, with Scottie's help."  Nobody complained.

<p>

I tried to order books for the little library.  I had put my own rather large
collection in there, trusting my troops not to abuse it, and solving the
problem of persuading the architect to also put shelves in my private office.
Wasn't easy; the general feeling was that sales offices didn't buy books.
"Ah," said I, "this is a Technical Computing Bureau," emphasizing the
capitals.

<p>

"Would you like me to have the librarian at the Watson Laboratory buy them for
me, and transfer the costs down here"?  Good grief, no, said a beancounter I
ran to earth.  In the end I got an unsuspecting bookseller in Georgetown to
open an account "for IBM on 19th Street," and send a monthly bill.  It
disappeared into the system; the bookseller never complained either.

<p>

I began to get business.  There was some interest on the part of the older
salesmen, and I was doing a small amount of direct contact myself.  The word
"older" brings up a difference in Washington Federal.  The salesmen I had met
in Manhattan, and at the Hundred Percent Club I had attended, were young and
snappy.  They planned to be local managers in two or three years,
<a name="[-144-]"><font color="red">[-144-]</font></a>
district managers in two or three more, do a tour at 590, and be Golden Boys
or at least on Tom Junior's staff, in their early thirties.  Some of them made
it; the company was expanding magnificently - twenty percent a year.  Quite a
few of them disappeared, to surface a year or two later as typewriter or
timeclock salesmen elsewhere in IBM, or as tab furniture or paper forms
salesmen outside the sacred portals.

<p>

It turned out that while banks and insurance companies were impressed with
these bright young men, federal employees were resentful.  So there was a fair
complement of low-key salesmen in Washington Federal (Commercial was like New
York - or at least Baltimore) who had been there a long time, or who had been
successful local or district managers with a lot of government business and
asked for a Washington position.  They were mostly salaried, which solved my
problem of an attractive commission.

<p>

Anyhow, I had prospects.  One was the Air Navigation Development Board, a
forerunner of the FAA development activity of the Sixties and Seventies.  They
wanted a simulation of air traffic patterns for various sizes of protection
zones around the commercial, private and military aircraft.  Two dimensions at
first, altitude later - and very simple air lanes.  Childlike compared to what
we do on micros today, let alone in an arcade game, but hot stuff in 1951.  I
worked on it a little myself, then John and Libby took over.  We got ready to
send out our very first bills; exciting.

<p>

Also I began to get job applications.  One interview I remember was with a
serious candidate named Sarahan, who was working on a computer construction
project at the Naval Research Lab.  I sent him up to Applied Science with some
pride.  Others tended to be Service Bureau types that I could turn over to
Scottie or his deputy.

<p>

It was a fascinating time.  Our move down from New York had opened some seams
in my relations with Dorothy, and we were undertaking repairs with some
trepidation.  The Rocket Society and ACM were exciting, and I still had an
involvement with the Optical Society that I hated to let go; for instance, I
had been the arrangements chairman at the meeting where Haloid first
demonstrated xerography publicly, and the program chairman when Ned Land
demonstrated instant photography - black and white, of course.  And I was
watching the Applied Science incursions at World Headquarters, and
participating defensively in the seminars which Cuthbert Hurd was giving for
my buddies out in the world.

<p>

About Dorothy: from our first years together she had suffered from nasty
little fevers and infections, and from depressions that we attributed partly
to the other trouble and partly to the problems of wartime.  We had solved the
first problem, and had helped with a war problem involving her brother.

<p>

I had done a consulting job in 1944 for an ophthalmologist in midtown
Manhattan, and we had become friends.  He is in his late eighties now, but
still in practice; we talked transatlantic a few years back.  I had designed a
standoff lens for him, to go on the front of a powerful microscope objective
and greatly increase the working distance (from much less than a millimeter to
about 25).  He could not afford to have me do much, even at my low prices, so
I could not achromatize the design; he was content to use it with green light
<a name="[-145-]"><font color="red">[-145-]</font></a>
from a mercury lamp.  We tried to get him a patent for several years, which
kept the relationship alive.

<p>

He was aware of Dorothy's malaise, and wanted to help.  Since she did not seem
to have eye troubles, we resisted.  He said he treated a broad spectrum of
patients; all was grist that came to a midtown practice in those days!  I did
not realize until later that he had a unique medical method; each week he read
the Lancet or the AMA Journal, and boned up on one disease or problem.  For
the rest of that week he treated all his drop-ins for that ailment - not if
they had a broken wrist, or just wanted a fresh eyeglasses prescription, of
course, but everybody else.

<p>

One week he broke the news to me that he had diagnosed Dorothy's problem: she
had undulant fever, also known as Malta fever.  She should go to a specialist
down the street who was an expert in white blood cell analysis and have her
opsonocytophagic index measured [after fifty years I think I still remember
how to spell it].  He had never examined her himself.

<p>

Well, it was true; she did have undulant fever, from drinking raw milk as a
child.  She had had it for thirty years.  There was a specific antibiotic.
She took it.  The fever went away and never came back.  Now that's medicine!

<p>

Second story: Dorothy had a younger brother who was an engineer in Pasadena
for the phone company.  During the war Bob became a radar installation and
maintenance engineer for Western Electric; was catapulted off ships at sea to
repair jobs; worked out of places like Newfoundland.  Not surprisingly, he
developed medical problems, including a terrible case of shingles.

<p>

To control this the Navy put him on Fowler's Solution, which is arsenic.  He
broke his medicine dropper and the Navy gave him a big-bore replacement.  He
came down with arsenic poisoning; the Navy flew him home to New York, where we
tried to help.  He was on his last legs; they called it drop-foot.  Not to
worry, they said, implying it wouldn't show in the coffin.

<p>

Enter our, ahem, family physician.  "I have some doctor friends working on a
top-secret project," he said.  "They know how to pump arsenic out of patients,
and they are all set if the Nazis use poison gas."  There was indeed such a
chemical, and it was indeed a secret; it was called BAL, British
Anti-Lewisite, referring to a variant of WW I mustard gas which poisons the
blisters with arsenic.  Today such chemicals make it possible to pump all
kinds of heavy metals like lead and arsenic and plutonium out of people; they
are called chelating agents.

<p>

The project people were delighted to have a clinical experiment, and with the
Navy and Western Electric watching.  They gave Bob the Secret Chemical,
presumably with our friend in attendance.  It worked.  Even the drop-foot went
away.  Bob went home to Pasadena and resumed the gentle life; even got
married.

<p>

Dorothy was ecstatic, for a while.  But the depressions continued into the
postwar years.  We found a nasty psychiatrist who was big at Columbia
Presbyterian; we were living in Chelsea by this time.  He had his own, ah,
chelating agent, sodium pentothal; in a few weeks he had pumped some of the
heavy metal out of my dear wife.  Trouble was, it was only analysis; he told
her what her problem was, but not how to cure it.  My hypnotist friend Andy
<a name="[-146-]"><font color="red">[-146-]</font></a>
Salter said he couldn't solve the problem, which revolved around her parents,
but he could make her less aware of it.  Would it improve our sex life, I
asked.  "Always," said Andy.  "Get another girl," said Dorothy.  And at the
height of the excitement, I uprooted the poor baby and moved her down to
Washington.  Indeed, seams opened in the relationship.

<p>

I've painted a glowing picture of the Watson Empire.  Fantastic things could
be done, great rewards were on display, the surroundings - art collections,
Waldorf parties, Homesteads, Country Clubs, Kenyon mansions - were lovely.
There was a dark side, of which the arbitrary expulsion of married women had
angered me most; it was an empire, not a democracy, and the imperial rites
were sometimes painful.  Two of these darker events came close together just
as the little Washington shop was getting off the ground, and in the end drove
me to rebellion and expulsion.

<p>

The first was by far the uglier, although not so important.  I had asked for a
secretary "after we get going."  There wasn't anyone at Scottie's bureau; his
bids were sent out from Federal or Commercial.  I had heavy Rocket Society
correspondence, with LaMotte's approval, and an assortment of scientific and
business paperwork besides.  One of my predecessors as president of the ARS
was an engineer named Lovell Lawrence.  He had been one of the backyard rocket
experimenters before the war, had been involved with Goddard, and had ended up
in 1950 as head of the rather large Reaction Motors activity in New Jersey.
He had a falling out with Rockefeller, and left for another job in the Middle
West.  His secretary, whom I had dealt with many times on ARS matters, did not
want to go to Detroit.  Would she consider IBM in Washington, I asked?

<p>

She was not exactly Washington Federal, or even Washington federal: a very
forthright woman indeed, and vividly handsome.  I knew how good she was, and
Lawrence had of course confirmed it with a written recommendation.  I brought
her down for an interview.  She was sent to the IBM physician for a physical,
and turned down cold.  After some very loud bitching on my part about my
rights as the prospective superior, I got a hushed-voiced personnel guy to say
the doctor "had found traces of sexual activity - and the young lady is not
married."  What business is that of ours, I said?

<p>

Well, I took it to my boss Don Gamel, the head of Washington Federal, and got
absolutely nowhere.  The doctor was Mr. LaMotte's personal physician; the
decision is final, he said.  I knew instinctively that I had hit another
Watsonism of the dark sort.  I had been told at the Watson Lab not to protest
the expulsion of my married supervisor: "the law of the Medes and Persians,
which altereth not."  I should have been a Daniel then, for a loyal and long
time employee and a close friend.  The Washington affair was also an outrage,
but my potential secretary laughed it off, and went away.

<p>

No doubt a fair number of the IBMers thought I was involved, and perhaps
Dorothy did also; at least she seemed less angry than she had been when Marj
Herrick got beheaded.  Sadly, I wasn't; the young lady didn't need any amatory
assistance from the current ARS president, especially in Washington.  She got
a good job, but in Buffalo.

<p>

The Poughkeepsie excitements were mounting.  Bill McClelland and the rest of
the Hurd contingent were writing working programs; a new set of
<a name="[-147-]"><font color="red">[-147-]</font></a>
letters of intent had been received; 701 production was about to commence.
Cuthbert began to turn his attention away from the Defense Calculator, and
toward defenses.  His Washington representative was George Petrie, who while
personally very friendly had done almost nothing to help build up my shop or
my order book.  I was sure my rather threatening progress was being fully
reported back at Applied Science.

<p>

Suddenly I got an official note from Federal.  The business demands on Applied
Science and its New York computing bureau were increasing, and they needed to
requisition Stan Rothman's services for an indefinite period.  Hopefully he
could return to Washington in six months, but that would depend on business
developments.  Deliveries of Model II CPCs were soon to begin, and his
knowledge of the machine would be used more effectively than in Washington.

<p>

Well, that was my weak spot, and Cuthbert had struck it unerringly.  I could
not replace Stan quickly.  I could not finish up his documentation; I wasn't
even sure Carl and John and I could operate with his not-quite-finished
plugboards.  And I had paying customers coming in the door.

<p>

I went to my boss.  I said that Stan would be just one more body in Cuthbert's
herd, while his departure would destroy my little operation.  I said I had
talked to Stan about the offer, and that he wanted no part of it.  "You can
replace him, Herb," he said, "and Mayhew will get you through the Air
Navigation Board job while you are looking.  As for Rothman himself, I'm sure
he understands that advancement in IBM usually requires moving; he came down
here with you willingly enough," and more of the same.

<p>

What was I thinking? Not about Hurd, not about Tom Junior, not about where to
look for another job - but about Marjorie Herrick and my almost-secretary.  I
had stood up to The Old Man, and felt good about it afterwards.  Then, later,
I had flinched, twice.  If I knuckled under this time, there would be a fourth
time, and a fifth, and dark events without end.  Somewhere another imperial
wizard was plotting against Hurd, as Cuthbert was plotting against me.  But I
would be erased, or reduced to impotence, long before he was pulled down.

<p>

So I went to Red LaMotte and told him how I saw the picture.  Nonsense, he
said, we all just have to buckle down and do what is best for IBM.  "I know
how to use Rothman best, for IBM," I said.  "If he is not protected, you'll
lose him, and probably the rest of the bunch - and me."  I didn't try to
temporize, and I didn't say I'd appeal to Tom Junior.  I put it on the line.

<p>

And he fired me.  He was not amused.

<p>

Stan resigned, and went to work for the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica,
where he helped greatly with their new CPC II.  Libby Lindberg also resigned,
and married her young man in the State Department.  Mayhew was transferred
back to Applied Science; after all, they had said they had to have a man.
Southard shrugged and went back to simpler machines, but some years later left
IBM and established a successful nationwide terminal and network maintenance
company in Carolina, and got rich.

<p>

George Petrie took over the bureau temporarily.  I never found out if the air
traffic simulation was completed.

In later years I became quite expert at being fired or uprooted, but this
first time found me unprepared.  I had no plan for a new job, a new employer,
or a new location.  I was flexible enough; the problem was that the timing was
forced on me by New York.  Also the blowup itself took less than a week.

<p>

The wild reorganizing and job-hopping of the Fifties and Sixties was just
beginning.  When something like my Rothman crisis came up in those times, the
guy or gal under pressure pretended to accept the unacceptable, put out lots
of resum?s, slipped away for clandestine interviews, and departed in style
- with all the ancillary expenses covered.  Gamel gave me a month's salary in
lieu of notice, and slammed the door behind me.

<p>

Parenthetically, the whole little drama was unfortunate - for me perhaps, and
for IBM certainly.  Hurd probably brought with him from Carbide, and certainly
found at 590, the "win 'em all" philosophy and its attendant rough infighting.
He was prepared to overlook Eckert, whose desire to go on with astronomical
researches cancelled out his ready access to Watson Senior.  But Cuthbert
wouldn't hold still for the establishment of a rival computing bureau.

<p>

He could have co-opted me with a few words: taken me up on a high hill and
spread the world of a technical service empire out before me, under him of
course.  Trouble was, I had much more confidence in that vision than he did.
And he didn't trust me.  So the company lost three good people and disturbed
others, and a promising new IBM entry into the peculiar Washington
scientific/technical environment was set back.

<p>

I've already said how important the early computer conferences were, as a
substitute for today's technical publication and media coverage.  Everybody
went to every conference (there were only two or three a year, as against the
many hundreds we have now).  The second of what would soon be called the
<a name="[-150-]"><font color="red">[-150-]</font></a>
Eastern Joint Computer Conferences was held in Manhattan right after my
firing, and I found myself there in deep conversation with Jay Forrester, who
was building the world's fastest computer at MIT.

<p>

That meeting featured peripheral equipment, including such weird novelties as
magnetic wire input and output for the SEAC [Standards Eastern Automatic
Calculator] which Sam Alexander and his crew were building in Washington.
Forrester and his project were long on innards but very short on I/O - paper
tape and clumsy telex machinery, poor devils - so he had come down from
Cambridge to hear about possibilities.  Indeed, there were even a few
primitive exhibits, harbingers of the giant National Computer Conferences of
the early Eighties.

<p>

Aside from my need for another job, I had been drawn by the set of papers
disclosing, and in a professional sense announcing, the IBM Defense
Calculator.  I'd been out of touch with Rochester And Company for only six
months, but all sorts of exciting new stuff had happened in that time, and
speeches were revised up to the evening before presentation in those days -
and sometimes at the rostrum!

<p>

Jay Wright Forrester was already a major figure in our burgeoning technology,
in spite of his youth.  He had come out of farm country and the University of
Nebraska, and had been a prize graduate student among the great MIT
professors: Sam Caldwell and Gordon Brown in electrical engineering, and
Norbert Wiener of course.  He was tall; handsome in a very reserved way; a
driven man always rather uncomfortable to be with.  Decades later, when I was
president of ACM, I needed to reach him; his secretary said that even for a
very old friend, and the head of the professional society he had belonged to
for thirty years, the best she could do was to slide a note under his
always-closed office door.

<p>

He was two months older than I, and had had the same sort of struggles with
draft boards early in the war.  But these soon diminished under MIT pressures,
as he helped found the Servomechanisms Lab, and worked on the analog computers
inside those same gunsights I was doing optics for on Long Island.  He became
associate director under Doc Draper in 1944, and was appointed head of a thing
called the Whirlwind Project.  This was to be a tremendous land-based analog
air defense system (too big to be called a gunsight or a gun director), which
would aggregate in some mysterious fashion the signals from a network of
radars and vector out fighter planes to intercept the attackers.

<p>

It was a measure of Jay's vision that he had seen immediately, in spite of his
immersion in analog techniques, that the project would have to be digital.
Size was a drawback; the arithmetic and control unit for WHIRLWIND I filled a
large room, although today it would be one corner of a chip smaller than a
fingernail.  And in a very real sense, analog was instantaneous; input was
transformed into output without the delays of storage and analysis and
computation in my kind of machines.

<p>

But the arguments for going digital were overwhelming, even when Forrester
made his decision in 1949: accuracy first, perhaps, because it was difficult
to go much below one percent in complex analog devices.  A
<a name="[-151-]"><font color="red">[-151-]</font></a>
continent-wide air defense needed, if not astronomical accuracy, at least four
[decimal] figures - in modern terms, sixteen bits.

<p>

I mentioned aggregation.  As soon as you began thinking about selecting
signals from a variety of radars, perhaps averaging or otherwise smoothing
these inputs, and moving data around under a wide variety of circumstances,
the need for storage and variable programming pointed to digital - and did so
even when the Whirlwind project was getting underway.

<p>

And futures buffs knew that analog techniques were near their limits, and that
the digital world was in its earliest infancy.

<p>

I had heard that Forrester, drawing on the research of a wide variety of MIT
people and laboratories, was well ahead of the IBM storage experts.  Palmer
had needed to go to Manchester for an electrostatic memory system, and Jan
Rajchman at RCA Princeton wasn't having much luck either.  But Forrester's
crew were building special tubes, wiring them into WHIRLWIND for central
storage, and running real-time exercises (much more demanding of reliability
than what the SSEC or the CPCs were doing).

<p>

And history was in the making.  Forrester was becoming famous world-wide as
the inventor of core memory, which in the next two decades was to sweep aside
tubes and transistors - yes, they had just been invented, and computer
possibilities had been described the year before at the first Joint in
Philadelphia - and delay lines and fast drums, as main storage for all sizes
of digital machinery.  I had read his article in the Journal of Applied
Physics and understood the basic idea, which in those days was called
coincident current technology.

<p>

Certain magnetic materials, especially some ferrites being investigated by MIT
ceramics experts, had a very nonlinear response to electrical current.  A
reasonable pulse would cause a tiny magnet made from such stuff to switch
polarity, but half that much current had no effect.  So Jay had taken a little
ferrite ring and passed two wires through the hole.  When one wire or the
other carried a pulse, nothing happened; when both wires carried a pulse at
the same time, the magnetism reversed.  In the early embodiments, a 32 by 32
mesh of these rings was woven in a frame, with 32 north-south wires and 32
east-west wires running through the 1024 rings, which from telephone practice
were called "cores."  In a computer memory, each core stored one binary digit,
and 64 switches around the frame enabled you to select any one of its 1024
bits.

<p>

A world industry was to grow up around core memory.  Forrester assigned his
patents to MIT, which got rich from licenses granted to a hundred companies,
including IBM.  And Jay himself did very well, and richly deserved it.  At the
time we talked at the JCC, he was considering going to three dimensions,
relying on a touchier ratio: that two coincident pulses would cause no
response, but three would flip the polarity.  I reminded him that the real
payoff was how many cores he could pack into a cubic foot, that a 3D structure
would be much harder to wire either by hand or mechanically, and that marginal
cores would be more frequent.

<p>

He already knew all that, of course, but it got us talking.  I said what might
be genuinely gainful would be to store a ternary digit in each core, and
calculate in base-three rather than binary fashion.  There were materials -
<a name="[-152-]"><font color="red">[-152-]</font></a>
some kinds of permalloy, as I remember - that had north, south and neutral
stable magnetic states.  I told him I had taught my Poughkeepsie evening
classes at IBM about a special kind of base-three arithmetic I called "signed
ternary," in which zero was in the middle of the number range.  In this
curious system there was no need for algebraic signs, no problem about the
sign of zero, and you rounded perfectly by dropping digits.

<p>

Jay being a stiff type, I refrained from calling the ternary digits "tits," a
name which had been the source of much boyish amusement in the Poughkeepsie
classes.

<p>

Twenty years later I was utterly amazed to be asked to comment on a technical
letter from two Argentines, who as graduate students at MIT had exhumed the
report I had done for Forrester on base-three computing, and were proposing
to try it with hardware.  It would have been a great idea if something as tiny
and as cheap as the core-memory rings could have been made with three stable
states; the embodiment with two cores per tit which they proposed was not
attractive.  And somebody in Kiev had tried it, anyhow.

<p>

After I had done strutting about my trick arithmetic I told him I had been
extruded by IBM and was, ahem, immediately available.  "Come up and see me
next week," he said!

<p>

In no time at all I found myself a member of the MIT staff - not a professor,
but doing something called "industrial cooperation."  Jay gave me a salary
just slightly, judiciously, below what IBM had paid me in Washington ($10,000
instead of $10,200), and made me head of a new group called advanced logical
design, which was to explore ideas like signed ternary arithmetic and variant
patterns of core arrangement (yes, I had unwittingly hit two jackpots in our
JCC conversation).  The main task, though, was to think of practical ways of
making an infallible computer out of highly fallible Fifties electronic gear.
That infallible computer was to be the heart of the production version of the
air defense system; we called it WHIRLWIND II but when it finally appeared it
was called SAGE, Semi Automatic Ground Environment, a horrid military/academic
acronym.

<p>

I reported directly to Jay and his deputy, Bob Everett, who became head of
Mitre in later years and a major figure in air defense and related areas - air
traffic control, for example.  Jay and Bob (and I, in the next few months)
were convinced that replication of subsystems, and automatic comparison, and
replication of the comparison, and automatic updating of newly-repaired
components, would approach infallibility.  Shades of Tandem!!

<p>

Most of what I did is as dead as mutton today, but it may be amusing to note
that my primitive first look at failure rates and reliability requirements led
me to recommend five-fold replication.  SAGE installations ultimately came out
with two machines each, not five, and still filled large buildings.  And they
weren't infallible, either!

<p>

I had a group of three youngsters, and shared a secretary.  One of the young
men was Irving Reed, who stayed in the logical design business and became an
important figure in its more arcane developments.  Down the hall was a much
larger group run by Charley Adams, which did non-air-defense applications.
Most of their customers were MIT professors and graduate students, and it was
therefore very close in feeling to my old Watson Lab at
<a name="[-153-]"><font color="red">[-153-]</font></a>
Columbia.  It had to be more closely managed, however, because WHIRLWIND was
constantly being improved, and also had to serve as a test bed for future
transformations like core memory.  And of the time remaining, the air defense
work took the lion's share; there was a real-time experiment called Cape Cod
with real radars and height finders, and real fighter planes, and real
cross-grained military types.  So you had to be very careful not to waste WW I
time by indiscipline or stupidity.

<p>

Somebody brought around a compartmented tray late in the afternoon, and you
dropped your little roll of paper tape, held by an approved rubber band, into
your assigned compartment.  Next morning your run result [teleprinter output]
was in your mailbox.  Born programmers did quite well; the less gifted took
many weeks to get anywhere.  Among the more talented paper-tapers were Al
Perlis and John Carr, and after the collection we would go out on one of the
playing fields and run off a little softball - surely the only time in
computer history when three future ACM presidents cooperated that strenuously!

<p>

I noticed that, as at Columbia, there were lots of engineering projects in
Charley's shop, but no math; chemistry, but not much physics.  Inquiry
revealed that Norbert Wiener, who had just created the term "cybernetics,"
never came to our building, and was contemptuous of such foolishness as giant
digital computers.  I had a couple of disagreements with him at seminars,
largely because he kept trying to fit his continuous-math criteria to our
discrete-math efforts.  I escaped relatively unscathed because I tended to use
celestial mechanics examples, and quote Poincar?; also he soon observed I
had an uncomfortably frank way of dealing with pomposity.  Nevertheless I soon
felt impelled to christen him Nasty Norbert.  It spread quickly, partly
because he was so ugly.  What I was referring to, of course, was that other
kind of ugliness which was so tough on grad students.

<p>

I had known Sam Caldwell, who was somewhat into relay circuitry, from the very
earliest post-war days.  And I was treated very well indeed by Gordon Brown,
then head of the extremely influential EE department; he nominated me for the
Appalachian Mountain Club, and gave me good advice about how MIT really worked
- not at all the way it looked to most of the industrial types.  Forrester
knew how, of course, but you didn't talk to Jay about MIT politics (or houses,
or sports, or even why Whirlwind didn't get some IBM gear).

<p>

I had had a steady flow of visitors from overseas at the Watson Lab, and this
had slightly tapered off in Washington.  My little shop was not the unique
drawing card the SSEC had been, and English friends especially tended to go up
to the Bureau of Standards (then still on Connecticut Avenue) and watch the
sweat running down Sam Alexander's countenance as he tried to make SEAC work,
plan its western successor SWAC, advise the Census people about their
always-a-year-in-the-future Univac, and fend off IBM.

<p>

Cambridge was again a nexus.  Everybody wanted to see Forrester's baby: the
military vectored in their NATO buddies, the hardware types wanted to tinker
with Jay's core memory, and the academics were accustomed to stop off on their
way up to Aiken's shop at Harvard, which was really now a backwater but of
course still a great draw in Bulgaria.  I knew more of them,
<a name="[-154-]"><font color="red">[-154-]</font></a>
at least on the user side, than the rest of the project combined, which
certified me to the Caldwells and Browns and Everetts.  Jay probably didn't
even notice.

<p>

About living arrangements: I had moved into a graduate dormitory room near the
Charles as soon as Forrester hired me, and cast about with MIT help for
permanent quarters.  Dorothy was getting ready to move.  I found a rental
house in Belmont, owned by a Boston University professor going on foreign
assignment who wanted someone to take good care of his roses (I displayed
pictures of my wife's gardens; it was a drawn-out negotiation).  There was a
small garage for my prize convertible.  And the family had had pets, which my
Washington lease had prohibited.

<p>

Dorothy and I were doing well.  She was delighted to see me go back toward
research and Academe.  She had forgiven me for tearing her away from her
psychiatrist in Manhattan, and indeed after many hours of self-analysis based
on the new things she had learned about herself, was trying to be a New Woman.
She had cut off her long hair, and wore an attractive short hairdo instead of
a chignon.  She had bought new clothes, and better furniture for our nice
little Washington townhouse.

<p>

We had had frank discussions about my frequent extramarital adventures, and as
a result she had waved me off fairly gaily when I visited a luxurious maison
in Havana on a Cuban excursion we took together in 1951, and later listened
amusedly to my tales of the novelties I had encountered.  Our sex life, never
spectacular, had considerably improved.  But after ten years of a remarkably
good marriage we needed a new focus, and agreed it should be something we both
could love: a pet.  We missed Suzy the cat, who had entertained us in the dull
war years with her lively litters.

<p>

Being scientific types, we started with book research, and moved on to Boston
dog shows.  Soon we came down to miniature poodles; standards were
magnificent, but too large for our small-tent camping and our foldboat, and
toys were unimpressive - wrong, but you can't learn everything from books, as
I had told Dorothy in Havana.

<p>

The Putnams, who were top exhibitors of standard poodles in New England,
suggested the Morse kennel on the other side of Boston for good miniatures.
We chose a gorgeous little black male, took him home to Belmont two weeks
later, and named him Diablotin D?odat de Dolomieu.  Diablotin was the
kennel name, D?odat means "a gift from Heaven," and DdD was the man for
whom Dolomite [rock and mountains] was named.  We called the little guy Deo,
Day-oh, and he was indeed a focus of our attention and our love for the rest
of the marriage.

<p>

I remember vividly a drive up into the White Mountains with Charles Goodwin,
head of the Maths Division at the National Physical Laboratory outside London,
who at that instant in time was Alan Turing's boss.  Dorothy was happy,
Goodwin was delighted - and Deo was ecstatic.

<p>

The beautiful but mistreated Buick of the mid-Forties had been replaced by a
little Plymouth station wagon which pioneered the idea of folding up the rear
seat for extra space - perfect for our camping and boating, but dull to look
at.  When things were at their best in Washington I had traded the wagon for a
superb Chrysler New Yorker, as big as a house (and almost bigger than the
Belmont garage).  It had the brand new hemi [hemispherical cylinder
<a name="[-155-]"><font color="red">[-155-]</font></a>
head] V-8 engine, power brakes and steering - then also new - a power-operated
convertible top, and on and on.  It was by a city mile the fanciest car ever
parked outside the Barta Building, where WHIRLWIND I lived.  Everett and Adams
had very ordinary transportation, the Perlises and Carrs rode bicycles, and
nobody knew how Jay got to work.  A chariot of fire, the youngsters would have
guessed; I would have voted for a deep subterranean passage.

<p>

It was a smooth and lovely interlude.  D?odat and Dorothy and I were as
happy as could be.  The work was rewarding, although I hadn't produced
anything earth-shaking in my first few months.  Gordon Brown had steered me
gently toward trying for an academic appointment in 1954, perhaps in his
department (mathematics was foreclosed by Nasty Norbert, and there was at that
time no prospect for space science or astronomy slots).  I saw clearly that
MIT policy decisions came from the apparatchiks, who were all professors.  And
I had a very good Ph.D., unlike Forrester, who had been swept away from one by
war work.  It might mean a slight cut in salary, and as had been my custom
since boyhood, I was spending all I made and then some.  But Dorothy wanted to
go back to work.

<p>

Then the heavens opened.  As I have mentioned already, I had advised several
close friends about whether their outfits should order Defense Calculators
from IBM.  That kind of informal contact had continued, especially at
conferences and by telephone, while I built up the Washington bureau and after
I went with Whirlwind - or the Digital Computer Laboratory, as MIT had begun
to call it.  In fact, I had had almost all my information about how orders
were coming in from such people, rather than from Hurd.

<p>

The first paying job that ran on the SSEC had been for Hans Kraft of the
General Electric Large Steam Turbine and Generator Department, who was
continuing to struggle with Mother Nature.  She did not want him to find out
how compressible, near-turbulent flows went in a rotating lattice of airfoils
[turbine buckets and blades].  He had tried using the giant GE differential
analyzer, masses of punched card machines, fancy applied mathematicians, and
the SSEC; in later years he would go out to Hanford and try hundred-decimal
calculations on their IBM 702.  No matter where he pushed in, the problem
bulged out somewhere else.  Clearly Mother Nature knew how to solve it: squirt
lots of steam into actual buckets, and watch very closely.  Such experiments
cost the earth - more than renting a Defense Calculator, for sure.  So I had
advised Hans to get in line for one.

<p>

General Electric was a valued IBM customer - the largest in the world at that
time except for the U.S.  government and the Bell System.  Kraft had
introduced me to one of the other major engineering operations of the company,
which designed and built jet engines, and which had turbine problems and
compressor problems and combustion problems and control problems.  His
counterpart was one Bert Sells, whose department was located in Lynn,
Massachusetts, and who operated a CPC I in nearby Boston.

<p>

Sells had told me the headquarters of the engine division was to move to a
huge factory just outside Cincinnati, leaving the test cells and much
engineering behind in Lynn.  He confirmed that the jet engine operations
needed computing power even more than the turbine people in Schenectady, and
he and Hans planned to recommend that the two groups share a Defense
<a name="[-156-]"><font color="red">[-156-]</font></a>
Calculator - by this time scheduled to rent for $15,000 a month for one shift,
and $30,000 or more around the clock.  That wasn't a trivial expenditure in
1951 even for giant General Electric.

<p>

When they told me this I said, "Your big problem will be staffing.  You will
need dozens of programmers, and clever numerical analysts, and experienced
supervision.  None of that will come easily in Schenectady or Lynn, and it
would be a real wowser in Ohio."  Sells was unhappy; he was pushing for
Cincinnati, knowing how conservative Schenectady was, and how union-ridden and
space-limited Lynn was.  Also he had been thinking of, oh, ten people.  I
showed him the list of Backuses and Codds behind the scenes at the SSEC, and
the list of Sheldons and Kubies in Hurd's New York shop.  "When a Defense
Calculator runs three shifts," I said, "you will need a hundred bods, and
you'll have to train most of `em on the job." "Jesus, Herb," he said, "I have
trouble keeping my CPC busy one shift." "Sounds like you aren't the right guy
to run the new machine," I said in my usual diplomatic way.

<p>

I turned to Kraft.  "Hans," I said, "you remember Paul Herget from the
Endicott seminars.  He heads the University of Cincinnati Observatory, has
just come back from a hitch at the Naval Observatory, and must be itching for
a fancy machine.  He'll never get even a CPC through the university.  And he's
terrific.  Only thing is, he suffers from the Wallace Eckert syndrome."  "You
mean he will want to do a lot of astronomical calculations," muttered Kraft.
"Watch him," I said.

<p>

I was sitting in my cramped but pleasant little office in the Barta Building
one morning, thinking about ternary arithmetic, and also about foldboating
with the Appies next weekend, when the phone rang.  "How about lunch at the
Somerset with Hans and me?" asked Bert Sells.  Very fancy for lunch in those
days, was the Somerset - and I hadn't talked to Kraft or Sells for months.

<p>

"GE has ordered a Defense Caculator, Herb," said Sells.  "We expect to get one
of the first ones, and we are indeed going to put it in Ohio.  The costs will
be shared with the turbine division, but my department will run it.  We're in
a new laboratory building; there's lots of space, and good facilities for
engineering-type people.  The suburb is called Evendale, and we already have
six thousand employees there on the manufacturing side."

<p>

"Wonderful!" I said.  "Did you ask Herget?" "We sure did," said Kraft, "but he
insisted he had to have time on the machine to do asteroid orbit calculations,
and fancy celestial mechanics later on.  We didn't even try to get that past
our bosses.  Four or five years ago, maybe - right now we have to show results
for all that rent.  God knows we have enough problems waiting."

<p>

"Herb," said Sells, "you got us into this.  You've got to come down to
Evendale and run the damn thing."  "I'd love to, Bert," I said, "but I've only
been here five months.  I can't possibly do it."  "We've already talked to
Forrester," said Sells, "and he says you can go any time."  Gulp!!

<p>

Well, it turned out I wasn't all that unvaluable to Jay after all.  General
Electric was funding, from Lynn, a very important gas turbine research
facility at MIT, and had been doing so for several years.  When Sells
persuaded his bosses to ask for my head on a platter, like that other prophet
John the Baptist, my small current contributions and possible future academic
value were shoved briskly aside.

<p>
<a name="[-157-]"><font color="red">[-157-]</font></a>

I liked MIT.  I liked Boston.  Dorothy and D?odat liked Belmont.  But I was
swept away, and not unwillingly.  I would be a line manager in an engineering
company, the greatest one in the world.  I would be using my contacts in
rocketry and in the tin airplane business.  And I would have my own great big
wonderful computer.  Also a little green demon kept whispering in my ear that
I would be poking IBM in the eye with a very sharp stick.

<p>

I knew where the bodies were buried at 590 and in Poughkeepsie.  I was good
friends with the Rochesters and the Bill McClellands.  I knew more about the
Defense Calculator than any other customer.  All that was to the advantage of
my new employers - and my new employers knew it.  They treated me well from
the very beginning; I soon learned to call GE "Generous Electric."  I got an
immediate raise to $12,000 and promises of frequent reviews.  I got a great
move, much to Dorothy's relief; she had been treated well when we went down to
Washington in Mary Noble Smith's museum van, but not so carefully when MIT
moved us to Belmont.

<p>

On the other hand, I was about to install the very first giant computer in the
General Electric Company, the first in the aircraft engine business worldwide,
and the first in the American middle west.  I knew very little about my new
employer, and nothing about Cincinnati.  Well, as Napoleon said, I was well
positioned to attack in any direction!

<p>

I was hired in as a first-level supervisor, and handed the Numerical Analysis
Unit of the Aircraft Gas Turbine Development Department.  That consisted of a
serious young mechanical engineer named Gene Gettel, four attractive women
with math degrees who were listed as subprofessionals, and an underutilized
Model I Card Programmed Calculator installed in a back room in the office
building attached to North Station in downtown Boston.

<p>

A few minutes conversation made it clear Gene and the girls were the right
stuff.  I swept them up - none of them wanted to move to Ohio - bargained
briskly with a bemused IBM salesman for two CPC IIs in Evendale (he said the
backlog was six months), turned in the Model I, and headed for Evendale.  GE
had a specialist IBM interface which had handled the big-machine order; I told
the people involved on both sides that George Richter would fix up my Model
IIs if they could reach him: "If you have trouble I'll call him myself; just
let me know."  The expression had not been invented yet, but I was On A Roll.

The jet engine business was wonderful.  It put you at the very cutting edge
of aerodynamics, combustion theory, mechanical engineering, and controls
technology.  A host of bright, vigorous men - and a few women - were
introducing new ideas and materials, and otherwise increasing the number of
design parameters.  The market was enormous, and still growing.  There were
a dozen competitors worldwide, led by Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut, and
including such powerhouses as Westinghouse, Allis Chalmers, Curtiss Wright,
GM's Allison - and overseas, Rolls Royce.  Smaller engines were being built
by AiResearch, Allison and others.  General Electric was a relative
newcomer, but already the challenger all through the spectrum - the tough
new kid on the block.

<p>

Moreover, the competition was honestly technical.  Sure, the salesmen fanned
out in the military and across the airline spectrum.  There was favoritism;
there were deals; no doubt off in the bushes games were being played.  But
center stage, the outfit that produced the most thrust for a pound of jet
fuel got the business.  There were considerations of durability, of
serviceability, of company resources and speed of delivery - and price
counted for a lot.  But allowing for those ancillary matters, the best
engine was the winner.

<p>

I was soon told that Pratt and Whitney and General Electric were swinging
six hundred million dollars worth of business back and forth each year,
almost entirely because of performance.  Move to a better manufacturing
facility?  Sure!  Build a $40 million dollar test rig?  Right away!  Put in
one of those big IBM computers?  Why not?  Hire a bearded ex-astronomer from
MIT?  Get two, if they have 'em!

<p>

It wasn't chaos.  It wasn't war time.  GE was a carefully organized and
closely managed company, very much larger than IBM and with a long tradition
<a name="[-160-]"><font color="red">[-160-]</font></a>
of genuine research - Steinmetz decades ago, and Nobel prize winners; far
beyond what Watson Senior had been able to do.  But the engine boys were
hot.  They could move much more quickly than the lamp bulb boys or the
dishwasher boys or even the steam turbine boys.  Company rules said you had
to have permission of the board of directors to buy land or build a major
structure.  That applied to the engine division too - but its requests got
approved awfully fast!

<p>

I knew how strong GE was.  Kraft had shown me the huge turbine shops in
Schenectady, where the rough forging for a big generator rotor cost $150,000
and could be ruined by one wrong tool setting, on a machine so big the
operator had to climb a tall ladder to look at how the cut was going, and
might take his lunch bucket along.  I knew the jet engine test cells in Lynn
could run only at night because they took most of the power of the area, and
that attempts had been made to anchor decrepit naval vessels in the nearby
river to supply daytime steam power (and reduce the complaints about noisy
post-midnight testing).

<p>

Even so, Evendale was a revelation.  There were literally square miles of
buildings, built at the end of the war for piston engine production.  Plant
layout was a major operation.  Intraplant transport was a major operation.
Security was a major operation.  Raw material storage was by tens of acres.
And they told me most of the division was still up in Massachusetts!

<p>

My little band was plopped down in a new-building area across the road from
the manufacturing operations.  Green grass, nicer cafeteria facilities,
snappier guard service to handle the hordes of salesmen calling on the
hundreds of buyers; it was industrial but attractive.

<p>

There was no art collection, and no Mary Noble Smith to choose curtains and
carpets; three years later I put tropical fish and green plants and Herman
Miller pretties in my own computer building, but it all disappeared as soon
as I left.  There was a definite GE culture; I was prepared for it; I was
very well treated within it.  But The Old Man had been something special,
and I often missed him.

<p>

I soon found there were organization charts, even if there were no oil
paintings.  General Electric was an open book, or tried to be.  You could
trace authority down from the very top through your group, your division,
your department, your section, your subsection, your unit - to you.  There
were tests when you came aboard, entrance interviews, performance (salary)
reviews, appeal procedures.  And across the road, unions!

<p>

One great thing I discovered: the official printed multi-color organization
chart (always a little out of date, alas!) said explicitly that while
authority flowed down, and via rigidly prescribed channels, information
could flow upward and across and leap from block to block.  That was why
Sells and Kraft could help each other without getting permission from
something like five levels of managers above Bert and four levels down to
Hans (they were in different groups), or vice versa.

<p>

In Olympian IBM it had been much different; you asked yourself, "Would
Mr. Watson want me to say this (or do this, or order this)?"  If you thought
he would, you did it.  If somebody upstairs thought he wouldn't, you were in
deep trouble, unless someone further upstairs thought he would - in which case
Mr.
<a name="[-161-]"><font color="red">[-161-]</font></a>
Part Way was in the soup instead, like the vice president who guessed
wrong about those WCs at the Watson Lab.  In GE you could ask without risk -
well, with much less risk.

<p>

And if an important customer from the American Airlines engineering
department wanted to eat prunes in the conference room, you could share them
with him unabashed!

<p>

Almost anything - I mentioned real estate deals as an exception - could be
done with the approval of two levels of management: your direct boss, and
his boss.  When I piled up a racing car years later at Willow Springs, and
woke up debearded and alone in a hospital two hundred miles from my GE
troops in Santa Barbara, it took one call from me to my then boss, Tom
Paine, and one from him to his division general manager back in Schenectady,
to put me into an air-conditioned Cadillac ambulance and on the road to a
hospital where the gang could drop in for advice.  So the insurance didn't
cover it?  Two levels of GE management did.

<p>

Well, to work! The Numerical Analysis Unit found itself in basement space in
a laboratory building.  It was cavernous; chosen to hold the Defense
Calculator when it came.  There were no windows except into a big areaway
through which the pieces of the computer would be lowered.  We were promised
ample office space on the second floor, but there was no elevator.  I
emphasized that we were going to be one great big huge bunch of guys and
gals; my boss, a veteran GE mechanical engineer named Frank Warner, looked
at my little huddle of reluctant Bostonians and smiled gently.

<p>

His main worry was not floor space, but floor.  I told him there would be
hundreds of thick, sensitive signal and power cables running between the
boxes of the computer when it arrived - in seven months, we thought.  The
idea of raised flooring was unheard of in our tiny trade, but of course I
had seen Watson order it for the beautiful SSEC room in 1946.  "No," said
Frank, "the ceiling is too low already for the air conditioning you claim
you are going to need; a foot less is out of the question."  "We'll have to
cut trenches with a diamond saw when the layout is finalized," I said.
"Where do you want me to put the two CPCs while that is being done?  They
can't run in cement dust."  "Hmmm," said Frank, wincing.

<p>

The first of the two CPC II systems got to Evendale before my troops (but
not before me; I was indeed on a roll, and would have come by Concorde if
the service had been available.  Dorothy and D?odat were packing).  Six
months? Not for a 701 customer who knew George Richter!  The power supply
wasn't quite right, but the facilities people fixed it in hours; Evendale
Plant was on a roll too.  I thought we could get along without extra air
conditioning, if the ducts were opened up.  "Just call us, pal," said the
Evendalers.

<p>

Note the "701."  My first visitor, even before the CPC arrived, was of
course my Very Own Friendly Local IBM Sales Representative and one thing he
told me was the new name for the Defense Calculator: IBM Type 701 Data
Processing System.  Coooo!

<p>

About my VOFLIBMSR: he was a great piece of luck for me.  Not entirely
intentionally, perhaps; although Applied Science was trying to place
special, um, agents at all the early 701 sites, and I turned out to be
Number Six, I was
<a name="[-162-]"><font color="red">[-162-]</font></a>
treated differently.  This chap was not a techie; Cuthbert
And Co. claimed they realized I could do without one.  My guesses were, a)
they were short-handed, b) they were afraid I would steal away or at least
pollute one of their innocents, and c) they could stick a sharp stick in an
eye as well as anybody.

<p>

Anyhow, my man was one Stanley Farwell, nephew of a very famous early-Watson
executive who some years later left IBM to become the Number Three at RCA.
Fred Farwell, whom I never met, was about at Red LaMotte's level in postwar
IBM, and had helped Stan find a place in the sales force when he got out of
hospital in the late Forties.

<p>

Stan was very tall, lean, a wolf with a gentle smile.  He had a glamorous
society wife who was a little lost in Cincinnati, and a prewar Lincoln
Continental that he was lovingly restoring - twenty coats of hand-rubbed
white lacquer, as I remember.  He was notorious in his IBM circles for
taking leave in the summer to go with the circus, or to a logging camp, to
work off his tensions.  He took great pains to preserve his Continental
while away, but I gathered later, not so much to preserve his marriage.

<p>

He got away with this because he was almost the last survivor of a Ranger
battalion that was wiped out in Normandy.  He had been reconstructed
physically and mentally, but a lot of Good IBMers like Watson Junior and
Garland Briggs were still watching over him.  The assignment to help me put
in the 701 was a way of getting him away from the rather grinding sales
routine of local offices.

<p>

He had great contacts back in Watsonland, but he was irreverent about them.
He had heard about George Richter, and was impressed with how my CPCs had
appeared out of nowhere.  I liked him immediately; in spite of the stories
about his problems, which I heard from my VOFLCE, Very Own Friendly Local
Customer Engineer, he was always around when we needed him.  He brought me
all kinds of technical gossip from his trips to 590 and Endicott and
Poughkeepsie (and was exceedingly sharp about it for a non-techie), and
smoothed the commercial relations with a somewhat bewildered downtown
Cincinnati IBM office.  And he was a warm if somewhat injured human being.

<p>

My new boss was in charge of the laboratories and test facilities of the AGT
(Aircraft Gas Turbine) Development Department.  That meant he had all of the
building we had landed in, several acres of outdoor machinery out back, and
a sizeable number of engineers en route from Lynn.  He reported to the
manager of engineering, Neil Burgess, who reported to the department general
manager, Dave Cochran, who reported to the AGT Division vice president, Jim
LaPierre.  The division had 14,000 employees in Massachusetts and Ohio, plus
sales and service reps all over hell and gone: in Korea and on aircraft
carriers, at a dozen Air Force bases, and at several airline maintenance
centers.

<p>

LaPierre had two departments in Lynn; one doing small engines and the other,
controls and fuel pumps and such.  In Evendale he had a sizeable
prototype-engine department, and Cochran's outfit.  And divided between the
two sites he had a huge manufacturing department with over nine thousand
union employees and foremen and managers.  The division did nearly a billion
1953 dollars a year, made a useful profit, and was growing like mad.  In the
<a name="[-163-]"><font color="red">[-163-]</font></a>
late Seventies it was a group, and had gotten up to 40,000 people.  It must
be even larger today.

<p>

I'll write more later about the General Electric management philosophy, and
how it interacted with the three great challenges of nuclear engineering,
jet engine manufacturing and computer marketing.  One of its tenets was that
each department had its own manufacturing, engineering, finance, marketing
and employee/community relations sections - and its own bottom line.  In
Cochran's case the manufacturing was small and specialized, with emphasis on
new materials and processes.  And marketing was mostly market and product
planning.  Engineering, though, had nearly a thousand bods, and cost the
earth.  Adding a 701 was small potatoes - at least, at first!

<p>

Our building, for instance, housed a big electronics lab that was designing,
and testing components for, a giant analog jet engine simulator.  GE was to
build this monster at Wright Field (just a few miles away).  At the other
end of the ground floor was a suite of bench-science labs doing combustion
research, and they also had flame tunnels and such out back.  Upstairs was a
vast open office space, partly loaned out to a preliminary design group
which was not under Frank - another part of the Engineering Section.  I was
offered an adjacent area, and rather shrewdly said we would need it and a
lot more "when our Big Computer comes," but wanted to be near our new-model
CPCs in the basement until we got used to them.

<p>

I went up to the main building and introduced myself to the personnel crew.
Their boss was at subsection level, and tended to resist my romantic yarns
about the vast hordes of men and women I was going to recruit.  But he
reported to a woman, unheard of elsewhere in GE but of course familiar to me
from IBM experiences.  Her name was Marion Kellogg, and in later years she
became General Electric's first woman vice president and made the cover of
BUSINESS WEEK.

<p>

She saw that my curious ads got printed, that my curious prospective
employees got tested and "processed," and that the ones I curiously liked
got taken aboard briskly.  There were no trade papers to advertise in, and
no youngsters using computers in their college courses, and certainly no
computer science departments, even at MIT.  I bypassed Burgess and got
Cochran to authorize an open requisition for programmers; he expected me to
hire four or five, poor boy!

<p>

"Marion," I said (everybody used first names in GE, although I slipped and
called the president "Mr. Cordiner" the first time I met him), "about these
young ladies I kidnapped in Massachusetts: they all have excellent degrees,
from better colleges than most of the engineers they work with.  They all
are planning on careers in the computer area.  They have to make expensive
decisions without much guidance.  And CPC operation is a damned scarce
skill.  Can we get `em off the time clock?"

<p>

"Your friend Hans Kraft has several girls running desk calculators and
punched card machines, and the differential analyzer in the General
Engineering Lab has half a dozen.  There are others outside of Schenectady;
we have three besides yours in 300 [my building]."  "Yes," I said, "they're
all waiting for some adventurous manager to fire the starting gun.  Hans
would love to make Bonnie and his other women professional; they have even
given papers
<a name="[-164-]"><font color="red">[-164-]</font></a>
at IBM conferences.  But Large Steam Turbine isn't the outfit,
and Schenectady isn't the town.  The 701 here is going to need dozens of
expert females; I can recruit `em a lot easier if you fix up proper status."
And I told her about the great gals at the Watson Lab and the SSEC, and
about Grace Hopper at Harvard and Gertie Blanch at the Bureau of Standards -
and about my own wife, and Barbara Schwarzschild.  Before I got through with
Maria Mayer and Marie Curie, she said she'd try!

<p>

Her boss Dave Cochran was young and vigorous.  And although I didn't know it
at the time, Marion herself was Jim LaPierre's private high-level executive
recruiter, and interfaced for him with senior consultants.  She wasn't a
feminist, nor had I assumed she was.  But she was an expert at
professionalism and at fancy recruiting.

<p>

I kept bringing in women for interviews, and I told them I expected to hire
them in as full professionals, right along with their male counterparts, and
for the same wages.  And I told my original four, "Hang in there," or
whatever the 1953 equivalent was.  Marion objected that I was putting
improper pressure on her.  "I know," I said.  "Dave has spoken to Jim about
the idea."  "I know."  "He may not consent."  "I know.  Would you like me to
tell him about Maria Mayer?"  "Oh, Herb!!"

<p>

It went through, and Marion then did her part very quickly indeed.  My young
ladies got their notices, and were amazed - I told them to be nice to
Marion, even if she was a section manager; she had been a physicist once.
My new hires all made it.  Kraft put in for his senior girls the day he
heard, and while there was some footdragging among the fuds, the women got
to tear up their timecards almost immediately.  It was a milestone in
Generous Electric.

<p>

Before I go on about people and buildings and the 701 itself, I ought to
write a little more about why the jet engine people were pushing so hard for
computer power.  It was a matter of complexity.  The lamp bulb boys in
Cleveland were also struggling to improve their product - make filaments a
little more uniform for longer life, make the base a little cheaper for
lower price, run the envelope a little hotter for better efficiency - but
their efforts were separable.  In that sense Hans Kraft's lifelong struggle
to improve the shape of his steam turbine blades and buckets was also
separable; his changes did not impinge on the system layout, let alone on
the specialist who was trying to find a shipping route from the doors of the
shop to the customer's power plant which avoided low bridges and narrow
tunnels.  In the fifty-year lifetime of a huge turbine, steam generated by
literally tens of millions of tons of coal would pass through; a hundredth
of a percent of added efficiency was worth struggling for.  But it was a
lonely effort.

<p>

Parenthetically, the medium steam turbine people (who did machines for
marine propulsion, and cut huge gears and such) had a man named Allen Keller
who was desperate for more computer capacity.  He wanted to optimize
powerplant systems design: size the boiler and turbines and generators, and
piping and cooling towers and so on, and even introduce elements of
switchyard location and design.  Today we would say he wanted to build an
expert system for steam powerplant layout.  He became a reluctant customer
of my 701, and a familiar figure at IBM and other computer conferences in
the late
<a name="[-165-]"><font color="red">[-165-]</font></a>
Fifties.  His was not a lonely effort; it involved almost every
element in his department.

<p>

But in AGT the very number of parameters was increasing.  The first
post-Whittle jet engines were simple systems - cantankerous elements, yes,
but few in number.  Now commercial users were pushing for much greater
economy, and the military all over the world were aiming at supersonic
flight.  So additional combustion methods, such as dumping fuel into
so-called afterburners, and bypasses for cool air around the turbine
sections (we say "fan engines"), and more stages and new complexities in
compressor construction, were being included.  And air had to be bled off
for cabin cooling, and fuel pump control had to be integrated, and on and
on.

<p>

About those compressors: down the hall in Building 300 was a preliminary
design group run by a fantastic guy named Gerhard Neumann, who soon became
my best - and most demanding - customer.  He was trying to make the front
end (ten or so stages of axial compressor blades) efficient over a much
wider range of engine speeds and altitudes.  You could fairly well optimize
the design for a single stage and a single speed and a single inlet pressure
using desk calculators and graphs, and you could test a single stage out
behind 300, or in Lynn if necessary.  But it was getting beyond the
capabilities of Gerry's men and women (yes, he had the three Marion had
mentioned) to do the calculations for many stages, and reduce the data from
many tests, in a usefully short time.  "We got to cut metal, Herb, not push
buttons on those damn calculators," he said.

<p>

Main thing was, he had a scheme to broaden the efficient regions of
compressor operation.  Between each row of rotating blades was a row of
stationary blades to turn the air flow; the two rows together constituted a
stage.  Gerry had had the tremendous idea of adjusting the angle of the
blades in the stationary row by rotating their bases - the variable stator
principle, which revolutionized General Electric jet engine performance and
helped them overtake Pratt and Whitney.  But, aside from the horrid
complexities of mechanism needed (the details of which also had to be
calculated, of course), an optimum angle now had to be worked out for each
speed and pressure, and was a function of the airfoil shapes of both kinds
of blades.  It was hopeless without at least CPCs - a hundred girls could
not have done it in time.

<p>

Pratt and Whitney had chosen to have the front stages of the compressor
rotate at different speeds from the rear, running coaxial shafts back to two
sets of turbines for driving power.  The bearing problems were enormous, and
it gave them less flexibility than Gerry's system, but was slightly simpler
to calculate.  They were in line for the Number Nine 701, and also had hired
an astronomer, my best student at the Watson Lab, Walt Ramshaw - unfledged
and unbearded, however!

<p>

Add to that the afterburner and bypass parameters, whole new kinds of tests
as well as larger numbers of old ones, and the problems inherent in dividing
engineering and manufacturing between sites hundreds of miles apart, and you
begin to see why LaPierre ordered a 701.

<p>

Jim was not an emperor in the Watsonian sense, although he had his moments.
For one thing, he had two levels of executives above him, a group executive
named John Something who didn't exactly throb with brilliance,
<a name="[-166-]"><font color="red">[-166-]</font></a>
and the
president, Ralph Cordiner (of whom more later).  They didn't stop him from
having his own china and silver - and chef - in his own private dining room,
or from having a hot Chrysler Imperial 300 sedan and driver instead of the
customary Cadillac limousine, but John S. made him really extend himself to
justify the Evendale move and the expensive high altitude test facilities
then being planned.

<p>

You met LaPierre very easily; he wanted to know about every new venture in
his division.  I was introduced to him in my first week at Evendale, and
noted the laugh wrinkles at the corners of his eyes first, and then that he
had a custom-designed desk with a large round hole [!] in the working
surface to facilitate waste paper disposal.  He also had a gorgeous and very
effective blonde lead secretary, and a string of unusual outside consultants
marshalled by Marion Kellogg.  About the desk: when he became executive vice
president and Number Three in General Electric a few years later, he had the
first office I was ever in without a desk - sofas and coffee tables, and
unobtrusive stand-up furniture where he signed papers between visitors.  And
handsome art (perhaps there was a Mary Noble at 570 Lexington), and no
portrait of Cordiner!

<p>

After the two CPCs were in full cry, and my unit was up to ten or fifteen
people, I was mysteriously promoted to subsection level, the same as Frank,
but left in Building 300, of course, since that was where the 701 was to be
installed.  It seemed diplomatic to continue to refer to it as his building,
since he had well over a hundred of the people in it, and all that stuff out
behind.  Its official name was Component Development, which I thought
exceedingly unglamorous.

<p>

My new boss was a section manager named Bruno Bruckmann, almost as romantic
a figure as Neumann.  He was tall and lean with white hair, had the Prussian
duelling scar and a North German accent to go with it - and a lovely wife
his own age, who had gone through the last days of Hitler Berlin with him in
1944 and 1945.  Bruno had been in charge of the final effort to manufacture
jet engines - radial, not axial - in the Third Reich.  Each night he and his
family and his senior associates retired to a deep bunker to wait out the
Allied air raids.  Each morning they struggled to repair the damage to the
underground factory, and turn out a few more fighter engines.

<p>

Bruno and his wife were picked up by the PAPERCLIP sweep which retrieved von
Braun and the Peenemunde families, and after months of debriefing they were
deposited at Wright Field.  There were also lots of papers and engine parts,
but nothing like the hundreds of tons of V-2 hardware that accompanied von
Braun to White Sands.  Bruckmann set to work on engine design, and after his
servitude ended with his naturalization, he was caught up enthusiastically
by GE for the Evendale adventure.

<p>

His section was looking particularly at a future supersonic engine, which
meant military in those pre-Concorde days.  If it went into production he
would follow it over to another department, so he was permitted to occupy a
non-standard slot alongside the Engineering Section proper.  His men also
became major customers of the CPC and 701 services, and I was well
acquainted with them before I was switched to Bruno.  The operation was
painless, and carried a moderate raise with it.

<p>
<a name="[-167-]"><font color="red">[-167-]</font></a>

I mentioned that, unlike IBM, General Electric was heavily unionized.  There
was a struggle involving mostly the Auto Workers, who were big locally, but
also the electrical union, which was important in Schenectady.  We all
anticipated that pickets would close off the engineering and administrative
buildings as well as the tremendous manufacturing areas.  Elaborate plans
were made for key engineering projects to move out to office buildings or
private homes, and duplicate drafting facilities were set up - including
security provisions! It was understood that each night when picketing was
imminent, enough data would be taken home so that work could continue if
access was severed in the morning.

<p>

In the event, our side of the road was undisturbed, and the precautions were
not necessary.  I was an exception.  Since running a CPC was a pretty
elaborate affair, and since I had convinced everybody that the whole
department would collapse if we were shut down, we had moved one CPC across
town to an office site before the strike date arrived.  We had to duplicate
many files, and transfer programming papers, and initiate security.  And
half of my gang actually moved, and worked at the new location for some
weeks.  I struggled with Marion's man for hardship pay, and failed.

<p>

Some weeks after the strike was settled, LaPierre and the union specialists
in New York came up with the idea of a fair for GE employees and local
supporters.  Because of heavy plant security we couldn't do tours or family
visits; I had never had Dorothy inside, although my bunch fixed D?odat up
with a fake picture badge so he could come to work with me on Sundays.  This
went over big with Security, and somewhat mollified their anger at my having
climbed a ladder to the roof of 300 and entered by an unsecured stair when
the guard at 300 had not responded quickly enough to my signals one weekend
(I promised never to do it again, or to kick in the plate glass door,
provided they never left the 300 desk unmanned in daylight).

<p>

GE took over a major hall at the county fairgrounds, and moved in samples of
what we did from the plant.  This was not just photographs and movies,
although we did have some of the latter to provide hot airplane shots.  We
put in actual machine tools and assembly operations, and a miniature
shipping department.  Security was carefully allowed for; all the parts we
showed were for commercial engines, and Security had a display too!

<p>

And needless to say, I hauled that same poor uncomplaining CPC, and a
discreet IBM customer engineer, out of the basement of Building 300, and ran
a working operation in public view for three days.  We were on local
television; probably the first time a computer ever came on live in
Cincinnati.  My troops divided between pleasure at being displayed, and mild
contempt for my showmanship.  But they all brought their families and
friends to the fair!

<p>

Jim had me on the carpet before the event.  "Herb," he warned me, "that
machine is precious.  They tell me even a few hours lost time would set back
important schedules.  And what if the riggers drop the thing?"  "Jim, we
took that risk when we moved it for the strike, and the riggers are the
same; I specified it.  IBM would have a new one down here in two days.  I'm
worried about the schedule too, but some of my guys will work third shift to
catch up if there is a real problem" (we were working two).

<p>

"And soon we'll have the 701, and it can't be moved to the fairgrounds,
<a name="[-168-]"><font color="red">[-168-]</font></a>
even for Mr. Cordiner." I thought it better not to say "Watson," and besides,
if T.J. had ordered me to move a 701 I would have.  No building columns,
though!

<p>

I was adding men and women steadily, using simple test methods (there were
no Programmer Aptitude Tests yet, fortunately).  I did the first interview
myself, usually, and started by asking if the youngster played chess or Go
or fancy bridge.  Then I asked if he or she read science fiction.  Finally,
I watched their faces as they walked into the machine area with me.  Had one
failure in nearly two hundred such sessions in three years, and that was a
nice young guy named Harvey who came to me from Paul Herget and had had
Paul's numerical analysis course.  And he was a great jazz pianist,
professional, besides.  Should have worked, and he wanted it to,
desperately.  But every time he corrected a bug in a program, he left two
new ones; the process diverged.

<p>

The professional personnel people gave intelligence and psychology tests,
and I always looked at the results.  But I never used them negatively.  A
good score I considered a real plus; a poor score - well, maybe a man had
had a fight with his girlfriend, or maybe a woman was scared of tests.

<p>

I had one piece of good luck very early on.  The head of the computer shop
at the General Motors Research Laboratories outside Detroit was a Jack (John
B.) Hughes, and he had signed up for the Number Seventeen 701 (on which, by
the way, GM initiated outstanding development of 3-D graphics - which I call
"curly fenders" for short).  Jack was originally from Cincinnati, and family
problems made it necessary for him to move back.  He and his wife Marge must
have been devastated.  Well, partly through his own connections in Ohio and
partly through Applied Science, we got together.  I was of course delighted,
and put him in charge of operations.  Three years later, when I went to the
ill-omened GE Computer Department, he managed to get into the
we-hire-'em-only-out-of-college Procter and Gamble, which headquarters in
Cincinnati, became their top software honcho, and is now retired.

<p>

I had continued to fret at the idea of putting my precious machine in a
basement.  The low ceiling, the lack of adjacent office space, and above all
the prospect of cutting those horrid trenches in the solid concrete floor,
stimulated me to action.  I found an informant who told me the local phone
company had refused to install switching and distribution gear in the
basement because of possible flood damage (the Ohio River was just down the
way).  I went to Bruno.  He was favorable, but it was Frank's building;
Frank thought it was a criticism and said, "Tell him to stay with the plan."
I appealed to Cochran; he took it upstairs to LaPierre, who said (according
to Dave), "I leave it up to you.  If it bothers you, toss a coin."

<p>

I got out of the basement.  Two years later, the Ohio indeed rose, and plant
areas were inundated.  The basement of 300 stayed dry.  By that time I had
built my own building.

<p>

I was already explaining about my equipment, and how others could join the
parade, on the rubber chicken circuit (local and regional non-computer
dinner speeches).  "Order your computer," I smiled.  "Get ready for its
arrival by choosing profitable applications areas, studying and refining and
mathematizing the procedures, and documenting them.  Then cancel your
computer order."  It got a good laugh, and of course once the poor devils
had
<a name="[-169-]"><font color="red">[-169-]</font></a>
done what I advised - and it was very good advice - they would
undoubtedly be swept into the maelstrom anyhow.  Besides, I wasn't selling
computers to Kiwanis and Rotary; I was selling rationality - and romance.
Cincinnati was conservative, and GE needed community support.

<p>

I set up a pattern to handle Evendale customers while we were still on the
CPCs.  In a few years it would be called "closed shop," and "charge-back";
the former was common [1952], the latter novel.  One of my men or women -
and in 701 days perhaps a team of two or three - would work with engineers
doing stress calculation, say; another would work with the combustion
researchers.  The customer explained the problem, and in many cases
prescribed the numerical method.  My guy or gal might help refine the
latter, or even take responsibility if the problem was new - and then code
everything for the machine, and run the problem.  And present the results
(that was shorthand for "persuade the customer the answers are right")!

<p>

We kept accurate count of human and machine time expended, and billed the
customer group at publicly announced rates.  You know, I can't remember
having any trouble at all setting it up, although it must have sounded crazy
to the accountants.  Perhaps the fact that Dave had his own financial
section was the key.  I did work for other departments, so there must have
been many arguments.

<p>

Oh, and I pulled out old Grosch's Law to predict the 701 economies as
delivery approached.  I wanted no CPC-lovers dragging their feet.
Reprogramming from a three-address decimal mini to a one-address pure-binary
maxi was not going to be free, or why was I hiring hordes of programmers??

<p>

Gerry Neumann and I, and several other men in the vicinity - and, who knows,
maybe Marion in her secret way - were doing something extraordinary.  The
trick word is "afflatus": overmastering or supernatural impulse, says
Webster.  "On a roll" is close, but sounds too short-lived.  My surge lasted
over three years, until Dorothy's death in 1956; Neumann's carried him all
the way to retirement in 1980: a group executive in GE, the leader of the
jet engine pack worldwide.

<p>

About accounting again: it was not clear how to handle the steam turbine
people, since they were to be billed by prior arrangement for part of the
701 rental.  But the problem was not urgent, since they had their own
punched card machinery in Schenectady and Lynn, and were going to come down
to Evendale only after the 701 was usable.  They were of course concerned
when Stan Farwell brought the word of a two-month delay in our scheduled
delivery date, which I realized years later was almost certainly due to the
quiet insertion of the National Security Agency order ahead of mine.  Who
got which machine when, was a secret which Cuthbert And Co. were desperately
trying to preserve; when you penetrated to the Poughkeepsie assembly area in
spite of them - and they then scrambled wildly to make it appear they had
raised heaven and earth to get you in - you found signs on the mainframes
saying "WHQ" or "Douglas Santa Monica," but in spite of Farwell's efforts I
never got in until after the sign went up for Number Four: "U.S. Govt." The
very name and location of NSA (Fort Meade), and even the telephone number,
was still a deep secret.

<p>

The pattern by the time I could write it down was IBM first (to replace the
<a name="[-170-]"><font color="red">[-170-]</font></a>
SSEC and provide checkout time), Los Alamos, Lockheed (not, alas, Bill
Bell), NSA, Douglas, and then "GE Lockland," which was the town out of which
Evendale was carved after the Defense Calculator was ordered by General
Electric headquarters.  Probably not coincidentally, when I got into the
area my machine was the last one carrying a label.

<p>

The labels were ostensibly for assembly and test department morale, since it
made the team working on your machine realize how important it was going to
be in the Korean war effort (NSA lost out on that one).  Of course, aside
from the connecting cables, most of the first dozen machines were nominally
identical, although Palmer and Haddad and Rochester were putting change
orders in by the hundred.  In a few months weirdos like me would be pushing
for an extra unit of electrostatic memory.  In fact, it was while I was
screaming about that two-month delay that I began bargaining for the first
or second "second box."

<p>

Stan now brought early word of the testing schedule.  Since the machine at
590 would not be ready in time, the customers for the next few systems were
to come to Poughkeepsie and use the engineering department 701 for first
trials.  Two at a time, so that when one team retired to lick its wounds,
the other would stride confidently to the console and, ahem, foul up.  Our
opposite numbers were to be John Lowe and Chuck Baker of Douglas, who had
been running a considerably larger group than mine and brought much
well-prepared material with them, as well as several youngsters.

<p>

The town hadn't changed at all since I had zoomed off to Washington.  Both
Douglas and GE were super-serious, and this was helped by my insider
information about Poughkeepsie excitements: night clubs, good restaurants,
fancy hotels - "there aren't any."  The 701 was being used to check out
changes, and for customer engineer training of course; we users were an
enormous nuisance.  John was a stickler for neatness, and needed to be
restrained from putting the working area in order before starting.  Chuck
was mesmerized by the power of the monster, and had to be driven away from
the console by superior GE force on occasion.  My guys, especially Gene
Gettel and Jack Hughes, were of course perfect gentlemen compared to the
airplane tribe, but I made up for it.  Chuck still remembers my reaching
over his shoulder and pushing the "get lost" button a few seconds after
Douglas time had expired!

<p>

As later interchanges occurred between the dozen or so important 701 users,
I saw that the division in philosophies, and notably the one between open
shoppers (the new wave, they said) and us old closed shop hands, reflected
the experience level of the supremos in each installation.  If they had
built up major operations in the punched card and CPC eras, and successfully
serviced a wide variety of customers, and if said supremos were pushing like
fury from underneath, large and competent groups of programmers and
operators serviced the clients (closed shop).

<p>

If an empire-builder wangled control, or if some poor devil was simply told,
"The company has ordered one of those big IBM machines, which will arrive in
ten months.  You are in charge; be ready," the usual strategy was to admit -
even, entice - the end users into the act (open shop).  That meant a much
smaller staff, and a much smaller recruiting effort.  It also ran the
<a name="[-171-]"><font color="red">[-171-]</font></a>
utilization up very quickly indeed, which looked great.  And the 701 was so
incredibly fast compared to the CPCs that the poorer relative productivity
was not noticeable.

<p>

I watched Lowe.  He was terrific.  He ran a very tight shop, serviced
Douglas Santa Monica and greatly helped other Douglas locations, and kept
his machine so productive that he didn't even need to clamor for a second
memory box or a 701A.  Lockheed, on the other hand, had depended on an
equally good operation, but outside its wall - Telecomputing.  When the size
and cost of the next class of machines and the central importance of
computing to the overall enterprise became obvious, a red-hot who couldn't
have collected scrap punched cards in Bill Bell's shop emerged, persuaded
top management to order a Defense Calculator, cut the ties to the outside,
forced IBM to send Lockheed the Number Three machine (for which they were
not ready), and later had to have Number Eighteen as well.

<p>

In the event, the two 701s were so powerful that genuine experts were drawn
in from outside, notably Bob Bemer and Bob Bozak and Lee Amaya.  But it
could have been a catastrophe.

<p>

Los Alamos was special.  On the one hand, it had terrible problems
recruiting people to work on the mesa, and under security restrictions.  And
on the other hand, its customers were bushy-haired bomb physicists who
learned programming overnight - junior Feynmans.  They were pioneers in open
shop philosophy.  Rand was also riddled with proto-programmers, and soon
lined up on that side.

<p>

Open shoppers used interpreters, programs that lived in the 701 and made it
behave like a CPC with a Rothman general-purpose board in it: floating
[decimal] point, three-address.  Slowed the machine down fifty-fold, but let
amateurs learn fast.  Lowe had his people writing matrix algebra routines in
symbolic.  I had my chief software artist doing the first compiler for the
701A.  It wasn't grim; it was fun.  We did "Jingle Bells" on the console the
first winter, and made Cincinnati television!

<p>

A while ago I wrote a magazine piece about the history of early computer
conferences.  In commenting on a paper about the first Los Alamos open-shop
language, SHACO, I wrote "I had a great closed shop in Cincinnati and
couldn't see why anyone would want the opposite: 'It requires more tactful
people', said the Los Alamite.  What I wanted was core instead of
electrostatic memory; definitely not tact!"

<p>

"Jingle Bells" reminds me to explain how I communicated with LaPierre and
other very senior GE executives.  To get to Jim via Bruno and Dave, whether
with a letter or a formal report, was difficult.  The path was open,
especially for the computer guy, but an awful lot of stuff got pushed into
that circular hole in LaPierre's desk top.

<p>

Getting to the vice president of engineering in Schenectady (who had ordered
the Defense Calculator), let alone to the Company Philosopher in New York,
Harold Smiddy, or to the president, was an even harder job.  I knew exactly
how to do it: for LaPierre I used the Cincinnati media - the ENQUIRER,
radio, television - or channeled words through the fancier service clubs and
such.  If I gave a speech about how romantic our plans were, say to
<a name="[-172-]"><font color="red">[-172-]</font></a>
transmit data over telephone lines from the Lynn test cells to my magic
machines in Evendale, it would be reported in the paper and on the evening
news, and get to Jim the next day.  Never failed.

<p>

General Electric published lots of company-wide publications.  I had watched
THINK Magazine in IBM; it was obvious The Old Man looked at every issue, and
we heard he read the riot act to Dwayne Orton if the flavor was off - or,
being Watson, if the quality of the coated paper deteriorated!  GE put out
an engineering review, semi-technical; they put out a small, more readable
monthly news magazine called the MONOGRAM.  To reach every senior engineer
in the company, plant a piece in the REVIEW; to reach Smiddy and Cordiner,
and every manager in the giant outfit (200,000 employees equalled 20,000
supervisors equalled 3,000 managers), plant a smaller and punchier one in
the MONOGRAM.  I did it several times; one featured a picture of me peering
significantly into the innards of a CPC, but the story was about the 701,
soon to be delivered.

<p>

Next issue contained a radioactive letter from a junior engineer at the GE
operation in Hanford saying that Grosch was peering into a CPC, not a 701.
By this time the 701 was in, and the next MONOGRAM had a photograph of me
peering into same.  It was reputed to be the only time a midget manager ever
hit three consecutive issues; when President Cordiner - ah, Ralph - came to
see the 701 a few months later he recognized me.

<p>

Side benefit: the irate junior engineer was named Dan McCracken.  I hired
him away from his reluctant boss in Hanford, soon made him a supervisor, and
encouraged him to write about programming (including a piece in the REVIEW,
of course).  Twenty-five years later he succeeded me as president of ACM.

<p>

I had escaped the basement.  There was ample room on the second floor of
300.  I took over the area above the simulator lab; we cut holes - lots of
holes - in the thick concrete floor over the workbenches of the poor
electronics experts, and laid the 701 cables in baskets fastened over their
heads.  It added atrocious insult to terrible injury that I was a digital
enthusiast, and was (accurately) reported to have said that long before
their monster got working in Dayton somebody would have programmed the job
on an IBM machine.  Ouch!  Turned out to be true, I believe, except that it
was a CDC.

<p>

As I said, there was no elevator.  Palmer, Haddad And Co. had proudly
designed the pieces of their baby to go through doors and into elevator
cabs; alas, I didn't have either!  Jack and Gene proposed that our FAGTFM,
Friendly AGT Facilities Man, cut a large trapdoor in the Building 300
stairwell landing, bolt a big chain fall - well, big for us; it was dinky to
our FAGTFM - to the stairwell ceiling, and presto!  instant upstairs 701.  I
expostulated that if anything came loose, they would bury the remains under
the same epitaph used for the evangelist strung up on Boot Hill: "Jerked To
Jesus"!  Not to worry, said Jack; he would stand underneath with a pillow.

<p>

I told Bruno and Dave we needed twenty tons of "local" air conditioning.
The FAGTFM recommended Carrier units; we got - guess what - GE!  We needed
oodles of good power, by CPC standards; turned out to be minuscule for
Evendale.  All of this came out of an elegant installation manual provided
by Palmer, Haddad, Hurd, Farwell And Co.  The cables arrived, along with
four
<a name="[-173-]"><font color="red">[-173-]</font></a>
diligent white-shirted customer engineers, and boxes and boxes of
beautiful CE manuals.  These were to be kept in locked files, also provided
by PHHF&amp;Co.  But there are some things even the Watsons can't command:
neckties get loosened, and blueprints get spread out.

<p>

Came the great day, Wednesday May 27th, 1953.  A giant Neptune van, with an
IBM installation man sitting between the driver and helper, was passed
through Security and up to the side door of 300.  A load of Poughkeepsians
scrambled out of a following wagon, Farwell and his downtown boss appeared
as if by magic, and unloading began.  The chain fall worked perfectly.
Instead of Jack Hughes, the young man named Pete who had ridden in the
Neptune van stood under it.  When I begged him to watch out, he said, "If a
piece does fall, I want to be right underneath"!

<p>

We worked like mad for four days, until midnight or later every night.
Saturday evening I got everybody together.  "We're doing great.  We're well
ahead of schedule.  Go home.  Tomorrow, sleep late, or go to church, or make
up with your wife.  Come in Monday loaded for bear," I said.  But the joint
was a mess - wrappings everywhere, and parts lying around.  And I had barred
the janitors, although the CEs had picked a couple for machine-room duty
later on.

<p>

So early Sunday morning I put on my dirtiest skivvies, drove over to the
plant, opened a closet with the building master key I had been presented
with after I promised not to climb on the roof any more, and took out a
pushbroom.  I was working happily away when there was a small commotion in
the hall, and in walked Jim LaPierre, master of 16,000 AGT employees
worldwide, with two serious civilians, and a gaggle of colonels and generals
in full regalia.  He was showing the Secretary of the Air Force around his
Evendale kingdom.

<p>

Bringing his guests over to where I was leaning on my broom, he said
deadpan, "Mr. Quarles, gentlemen: this is Dr. Grosch, who is in charge of
our computer project." Great scene!

<p>

Of course, the Secretary's son Don worked for Applied Science back in New
York, and had been in my classes at Columbia.  We all had a great time; I
was full of the machine, which Quarles knew about through his son, and happy
with my men and women, and Generous Electric.

<p>

A few weeks later I was promoted to section manager.  That broom was a great
prop.

A special issue of the chief computer history journal tells about the
appearance and performance of the 701, and boasts about its importance for
IBM and in the world of technical computation.  Certainly it worked
beautifully for GE and for most of the senior shops.  Of the 19 that were
made, only three or four went to dumb customers - and even there, the one
which was allotted to the Naval Aviation Supply Office pioneered useful
commercial mainframe operation in the U.S., beating the third Univac (GE
Louisville) and the IBM 702s, but running behind the amazing Dr. Thompson
and his LEO, Lyons Electronic Office, in London.

<p>

Some installations were shoehorned into nasty places.  There were indeed
trenches cut in concrete floors, and Pratt and Whitney remodeled a huge
hangar and put everything in one space.  In the pattern of the wonderful old
SSEC, the 701 which took over its space on 57th Street was handsome, with a
mezzanine staging area overlooking the combat zone.

<p>

My second floor shop was better than most, and only unusual because it was
installed upstairs without an elevator.  I had a glassed-in area for the IBM
engineers which overlooked the console, and this made it possible to have a
visitor's view without disrupting the machine room itself.  Back of that was
a giant arena for the programmers, much larger than the other occupants of
the building wanted, much smaller than I had asked for.  We filled it to
bursting in a year, so much so that we seriously considered second shift
programming as well as 168-hour-a-week 701 operation.

<p>

Couldn't do it; even in a closed shop my guys and gals had to have frequent
access to their counterparts.  I noticed, however, that several of Gerry
Neumann's men would come in at the end of the day, and work on into the
evening with their programming group.  That posed two problems:
<a name="[-176-]"><font color="red">[-176-]</font></a>
compensating
time off, which was easy as long as morale was high (I couldn't pay overtime
to professionals); women working at night, which was safe enough - the
parking areas were inside the secured grounds - but prohibited under both
state law and the union agreement.  I put the lawyers to work on that
intricacy, telling them to push "professional" (and that I had seen Marion
working late lots of times).

<p>

I had one failure.  Several of my best women started to swell up.  Didn't
affect their work in the least; in fact, the ones that were the most
pregnant seemed to be the most happy and the most productive.  I tried
Heaven's hard to get permission to put in a cr?che and a trained nurse,
and ferry the new mothers directly back to work from the front steps of the
maternity hospital - or so Marion claimed, with a silvery but insincere
laugh.  That, even Generous Electric wouldn't do.  Years later, Al Zipf did
it at the Bank of America, and today it is commonplace.  In 1954, I couldn't
swing it.

<p>

While I was at subsection level under Bruckmann I began to think about
functional organization.  On the CPCs, we had arranged ourselves by
customer: one small gang did mechanical, one did aerodynamics, one did
combustion.  I invented some titles, but they didn't matter; we were below
official notice, growing like Cincinnati weeds, about to move to new space.
But after my Sunday Janitor role brought me to section level, and after the
701 began throbbing and burgeoning, my concerns bore fruit.  And I had the
men to make it work.

<p>

Jack Hughes was easy; he took over operations as smoothly as if we had been
in business for a decade.  And unofficially he did most of the interfacing
with the turbine crews, Kraft's from Schenectady and Keller's from Lynn.
Gene Gettel was my front man among the AGT customers, whom he had worked
with for some years.

<p>

I needed a major software development subsection, and turned to a serious
chap whom I had stolen away from the combustion group.  His name was Donald
Shell, and he was just finishing a good Ph.D. - I seem to remember physical
chemistry.  He had of course been doing difficult problems for his ex-boss,
and you could see the "programmer look" developing.  Don't know exactly how
to characterize it; you can see it on the Knuths and Backuses, and on lots
of bright youngsters: sort of as if they are reading fine print off a screen
about two feet behind your head.

<p>

Don was more than serious, he was disapproving.  Of all my managers, he was
the one who least appreciated my antics, even when they turned out well.  I
wanted to differentiate our recruiting efforts from the other 701 outfits at
the joint computer conferences, which were getting pretty wild, especially
the ones at the Ambassador in Los Angeles (WCC 54 and WJCC 55).  I proposed
we serve champagne rather than plebeian booze, and was passing on to whether
we dared pay for really good stuff, when Don calmly announced he could have
no part in such knavery.  He was my best draw; sighing, we put out pecans
and cashews instead of Fritos, and lots of elegant mixers - and only brought
out the bourbon when Don was off duty (fortunately he went to lots of
technical presentations - and so did the men and women he most attracted).
Charlie and Jack and I oiled up the working stiffs while the young Dijkstras
swotted.

<p>
<a name="[-177-]"><font color="red">[-177-]</font></a>

"Charlie" was the universal monicker of my most gregarious manager,
otherwise H.G. Asmus.  He had been assigned to help me when I was a lowly
unit supervisor, partly to tell me about the special qualities and
opportunities of GE and AGT and Component Development, partly to keep my
books straight as I began the charge-back system.  He was one of the
graduates of the travelling auditor program by which the accounting network
in GE trained its prospects and maintained its grip on the purse, and he
therefore had seen other battlefields and been bloodied on a few.  We struck
it off instantly.

<p>

Sample relationship: I look around the horrid scene outside my office.
Several newcomers are literally sharing, two to a table - we can get desks,
but because only one person can be fitted into desk legroom, Charlie has
substituted a few tables.  Months ago I had designed translucent fiberglass
separators (this was several years before the office furniture people
started pushing cubiculation), and put desks face-to-face, to halve the
wasted aisle space.

<p>

It was a mess.  Outside the windows our own building was going up; there was
no revolt, but the inefficiencies were gaining on us, and it was an awful
introduction for new hires.

<p>

"Chaz," I said, "I'm off to New York.  Use your bean.  There must be some
way we can squeeze a few more bodies in here, or at least desks for the
bodies we have."  "Have a good trip," he said.  My secretary said the limo
was outside (yes, just for me - and I had a bedroom on the Ohio State
Limited too).

<p>

Two days later I got back.  The whole bunch looked cross-eyed at me as I
wiggled through the maze.  Something different?  Then it dawned on me.
Charlie had torn down my private office and put in four more desks!

<p>

It was a great idea.  Once the troops saw me laughing and joined in, we had
weeks of decreased tension and good feeling.  It wasn't the four desks - it
was Charlie's insouciance and my dumbfounded acceptance.  And it was all
over the department next day; great for section morale.

<p>

General Electric was at the peak of its organizational philosophizing.
There were courses; there was a magnificent set of books; there were
expensive consultants, up to and including Peter Drucker; there was a vice
president in charge.  It was too soon for a computer revolution, although I
was rather indiscreetly predicting a future when the GE headquarters on
Lexington Avenue would be full of machines and programmers, Mr. Cordiner
would have a reception suite on the ground floor, and the Master Of The
Computer - guess who? - would have the tower offices.  Everybody except
Charlie, and maybe Gerry Neumann, thought it was a great joke.  In the
event, the whole caboodle moved out to Connecticut years later, and my
skyscraper full of machinery shrank to a cupful of chips.  They couldn't
have put all the programmers in today's company in one dinky little
forty-story building, anyhow.

<p>

One element of that philosophy was that every non-Indian had to have line
responsibility and authority - no assistants-to, no staff sinecures except
at the very top.  And in that connection, responsibility and authority had
to match.  Another element was that the proper span of control was seven (we
will meet the magic number on an island in the St. Lawrence, later in this
chapter).  Five or six or eight were marginally acceptable; remember, you
had to have five section-level functions in a department, and a general
manager often had a legal eagle or a tame philosopher to fill up the
lifeboat.

<p>

Dave had the standard five, plus Bruckman, and now me.  And as the value of
Gerry's variable stator idea penetrated, and his personal dynamism chewed
the system up, he also had been elevated (before me, I think).  To balance
out, the legal counsel was attached to LaPierre, and Burgess the Official
Engineer got promoted across the street to run a department of his own.  It
was a mighty vigorous bunch; perhaps
<a name="[-178-]"><font color="red">[-178-]</font></a>
as a reward for hitting seven on the
nose, Dave later got the dubious honor of being shipped to the first session
of GE's own private internal business school in Crotonville, which I
promptly dubbed Scrotumville "because of the firm grip they take on you."

<p>

Actually, I rather enjoyed the management course Marion and her organization
boys put us local yokels through.  I was of course the nay-sayer: "Why did
the author of this chapter blow up one simple idea to eighteen pages, and
force a thousand section managers to boil it down again, Marion?  All it
says is, you should have half a dozen rectangles connected to the bottom of
your rectangle."  "Oh, Herb!!"

<p>

The no-staff thing was too rigid.  The central Crotonville theme, that a
successful manager could manage anything, was balderdash - and the
subsidiary idea, that management could be taught, wasn't much better.  But I
had seen in IBM already, and would see there and in other outfits later, how
damaging it was to have one guy in charge of only one or two others.  The
span-of-authority idea I bought instantly.

<p>

As part of my being elevated to Broommaster Marion brought down a consultant
from the Psychological Corporation to feel my bumps - a day of written tests
(to be scored in his hotel room, when the poor devil could have been across
the river - Northern Kentucky was the Cincinnati safety valve), followed by
a long interview.  I had the ineffable pleasure of being told I had the most
jagged "profile" he had encountered; very, very high or abysmally low in
every department.  "Computers bring black sheep to the fold," I said.  "Do
you know I have just written the Vassar placement office asking them to send
me another counterpoint major?  The first one was terrific." He was only
faintly amused.

<p>

It was summer.  Dave and I had gone up to New York and asked the Board of
Directors, no less, if I could build my own building.  It was to be next to
300, so no land was involved.  And it was only going to cost $650,000,
including (although Dave didn't know it yet) the tropical fish tanks in the
little lobby.  It was probably the smallest request from one of Jim
LaPierre's boys in five years; the High Altitude Test Facility was to be $40
million for the first stage!  Anyhow, they said yes.  I still treasure the
flip charts.

<p>

Next I was told I was invited to Session Three on Association Island (this
will bemuse anyone who has read Kurt Vonnegut's PLAYER PIANO).  General
Electric had a summer camp and conference facility on its private Thousand
Islands island, and each year selected managers - all of the top ones, and
most of the section guys (Marion couldn't go, I guess) - to attend one of
the week-long shivarees.  Originally, as satirized in PP, there was heavy
emphasis on competitive sports, notably softball.  To be on the winning team
was important; it was also important to drink vigorously but not get drunk.
By 1955 the heart-attack sports had been eliminated, but the expert
drinking survived.  There was a giant elm in an open space, and in the
evening the
<a name="[-179-]"><font color="red">[-179-]</font></a>
inmates gathered under it to hear words of wisdom from the
keepers.  The first evening an actor in full Red Indian costume paddled his
Genuine Birchbark Canoe up, landed just behind the tree, and told us The
Story Of The Elm; the last evening, President Ralph flew in by amphibian - I
kid you not - and told us we had a great year ahead.

<p>

The wives, and a few camp followers no doubt, were left on the mainland
where the special trains disgorged the masses of Erie, Lynn and Schenectady
victims.  There was a bar/night club on the Island called the Black Cat; it
opened before lunch, after sports, before supper, and put on a professional
but rather tame show in the evening.  Since the attractive waitresses were
the daughters of attenders, there was little hanky-panky - and the night
club artistes were ferried back to the mainland every night.  It dumbfounded
first-timers, but it was so easy-going compared to IBM Hundred Percent Club
sessions in Tent City, Endicott - all that drinking, and pretty girls, and
no company songs to memorize - that I enjoyed it more than most.

<p>

We lived in floored two-man tents, with facilities down the way (as in
Endicott).  There were seven meeting tents, each holding seven round
conference tables seating seven managers, and seven topics were discussed in
seven half-days.  Each table selected a spokesman to present its consensus
on the current topic (not in rotation - I did three), and at the end of the
morning or afternoon the seven reps got together on a sort of dais and beat
out a tent-consensus, amid catcalls from the relieved troops below.

<p>

On the morning of the last day, Ralph, who had embraced The Elm the night
before, and the Session Leader (a group vice president until the supply ran
out, and then the head of the Research Labs or whatever), and the seven
tent-spokesmen for the first topic, got up before all of us in a large
wooden church-like structure and worked out the Session Consensus on that
topic.  Then those seven scooted out, and the next seven came on with Topic
Two, and so on.  In October we each got a fancy book with the consensuses
for each topic, for all the sessions.

<p>

Need I say there were seven sessions that summer [1955]?  The next year,
which I missed, was the last one.  I often wonder what became of the Island
and the equipment - and the planners.  I would have liked to try the
birchbark canoe.

<p>

Back in Evendale I restricted my best yarns to my seven (of course)
managers, partly because everybody in GE who didn't have a hope of going was
supposed to be madly envious, but mostly because my more junior brigade was
not bloody likely to believe me.  Nevertheless, it was all over Building 300
in a week.  Marion scolded me roundly, but admitted in a weak moment that
she had indeed read Vonnegut and enjoyed him.

<p>

In addition to Asmus, Gettel, Hughes and Shell I now had a shop in Lynn
under Allan Benson, and I had been given an Operations Analysis group, and
had asked for the Division Technical Library, which I proposed to rehouse in
the basement of my new building.  Also I was paymaster for Dave's outside
consultants, notably one Myron Tribus, who sixteen years later became
Assistant Secretary of Commerce when I was writhing at the Bureau of
Standards (and who announced in his first interview with a computer trade
<a name="[-180-]"><font color="red">[-180-]</font></a>
paper that he put getting rid of that *&amp;^%$#@ Herb Grosch at the very head
of his agenda).

<p>

The building shot up.  I had done first layouts, and had specified two large
machine areas with maple floors like bowling alleys, supported on steel
beams with open webs, and with airtight sound-absorbing ceiling panels under
the beams to form air-conditioning plenum chambers.  You could change
machines around with a compass saw (remember, no flexible raised floors
yet).  We were to have two 110-ton steam-extraction air conditioners, either
of which could run one machine and cool all the people besides.  There were
two electrostatic precipitator units - in fact, everything was duplicated
except the cooling tower out back, and the main stepdown transformer in the
basement.

<p>

And I had a pad for a second transformer, and Dave's promise I could buy one
if we ever blew Number One, and blank spaces in the switchgear frame to work
it in.  Also the piping and pumps for the cooling tower were duplicated.
Shades of SAGE!

<p>

Jack and I worried a lot about checkout.  We could not run the air
conditioning without a heat load: a real roomful of hot computer.  And our
schedule was getting tighter and tighter; LaPierre was planning a gigantic
show of his whole Evendale plant just days after we were supposed to go on
the air.  Pushing to finish the building early would be no help, and if the
cooling didn't work it would take weeks for a major fix.

<p>

Jack came to me with the blueprints one Monday morning.  "I'm not the right
kind of engineer for this stuff, Herb, but it seems to me there is something
wrong.  This cold air going into the floor spaces is going to be wringing
wet."  Well, he was right.  We had a fancy architect, and the AGT facilities
people, and a man at GE Realty - but it was Jack who saved us from a
catastrophe.  They put reheat coils somewhere in the system, at no cost to
GE for sure, and when we turned everything on it ran smooth as silk.

<p>

Well, not quite; all that duplication planning had overlooked a single
strainer in the Y where the two cooling-water pumps joined, and it clogged
up with construction straw the first day!

<p>

Now I have to tell about the Oklahoma Land Rush, but before I start I must
talk about those IBM "classes" again.  The Hurd seminars of 1950 and 1951
were the last of their kind; we had digested the CPC I and the CPC II, and
were agog over the promised Defense Calculator.  The joint computer
conferences of the IRE and the AIEE and ACM began in late 1951, and the
disclosure to other than IBM customers of what was now the 701 came a year
later.  The production machines were rolling out.  We needed to know each
other better, especially those who had not been to the 1948-1951 Endicott
meetings.  We got together first in August of 1952; a wonderful gathering of
the old clan, with McPherson and Eckert and Palmer and Hurd, and dozens of
IBMers.  Sixteen outfits were represented, out of which the AEC and Bell
Labs and the Bureau of Standards did not in the end get 701s.

<p>

There was a 701 programming course in New York just after the JCC, but those
of us getting the first machines were past that stage.  Also there were 701<br>
prospects, most of whom were too late to get in line, mixed in with the real
customers.  In Evendale we curled the lip.

<p>

The flood washed over us.  A much smaller and wiser group got together in
May of 1954.  We gave serious papers about our experiences.  This was the
<a name="[-181-]"><font color="red">[-181-]</font></a>
cream of the cream of the IBM customer bucket; all but one of the nineteen
701s was represented, and by its top man or woman.  Yes, woman: the National
Security Agency, now admitting cautiously that it existed, was represented
by Dottie Blum, who of course stood next to me in the class picture.
Allowing for other IBM equipment in our shops, and for extra shift rental,
we counted for over 700,000 points - that is, $700 thousand a month rental.
But our parent outfits - General Motors, United Aircraft, Lockheed - had
much larger involvements with IBM; GE ran twelve million points, for
instance.

<p>

Almost every one of us was straining to the limit.  I was running two
hundred hours a week - round the clock on my Evendale machine, plus all the
time I could buy from the GM Research machine, and nearly a full shift from
Dan Mason at 590.  Lockheed and Los Alamos had two machines each.  No more
701s would be built.  Not only could IBM do much better technically, but
Hurd was telling us the 701 was priced too low by a factor of two.  We came
to find out about the successor machine, the 701A, and from the lips of its
designer, Gene Amdahl.  We would in the next year or two collectively order
more than forty machines - at 40,000 points apiece, one shift.  We were
ready.

<p>

Nothing happened.  We gave our papers.  We toured the factory (wrong one;
our stuff was in Poughkeepsie).  We heard about the 702 (wrong number base;
we were binary wizards).  We drank malted milks around the Homestead dining
tables.  Where was the 701A?

<p>

I drafted a red-hot telegram to Tom Junior, mentioning that the companies
waiting for 590 to get off its, ah, dead spot paid about 25 percent of IBM's
rentals - a slight exaggeration, but not too much.  John Lowe took it around
and got signatures - I still have the sheet.  The next day a shaken
executive from Galactic Headquarters appeared and passed out the dope - and
presented Amdahl for questions.  I claim it was Cuthbert, who was reported
to be down with the flu when we convened; Truman Hunter says it was Vin
Learson himself.  We customers were so intent on the message we hardly
noticed the messenger.

<p>

It was from that considerable success that the idea of SHARE was born.  When
it was started the next year the dozen or so founding organizations were
drawn from our band of brothers, and the lady from NSA.  We organized to put
concerted pressure on IBM, and don't let anybody tell you differently; when
IBM suavely took it over they swore it was to trade information around and
to help newcomers.  Hogwash!  It was to get Tom Watson and Vin Learson and
Cuthbert Hurd to come when we whistled.  By the end of the Fifties there
were mainframe customers everywhere; it took more than a telegram to 590, or
knowing how to call George Richter, to move The Grim Gray Giant.

<p>

Time wore on.  We were eagerly awaiting prices and delivery schedules.  IBM
had received dozens of letters of intent and a hundred expressions of
interest for what was now called the 704 - a 701 with independent
peripherals, and core main storage instead of those wild Williams tubes.
The whole thing had degenerated into a can of worms.  I had lost Stan
Farwell; Tom Junior, thinking him ready for battle again, had told him to
quit monkeying with that Continental, to quit running off in the summer (and
probably to be
<a name="[-182-]"><font color="red">[-182-]</font></a>
nicer to his wife), and to buy a hat.  Stan disappeared into
the works, and I believe died fairly soon thereafter.  He was a real help; I
haven't forgotten.

<p>

Cuthbert asked if I had preferences for a replacement.  "Yes," I said, "I
don't need a hot sales type, and he'd be lonesome in Cincinnati anyway.
Find me someone who knows something about our kind of computing, and who has
really good contacts in the labs and the factories.  I need inside dope,
Cuthbert, not discount deals."  Much to everybody's amazement, he shipped me
Liston Tatum, his right hand man!

<p>

We were old and good friends.  Liston was a humanist; had a considerable and
carefully-considered social perspective - not of much use in Applied
Science, where the win-'em-all ethic dominated, and near where the fierce
Vin Learson piled up his hecatombs.  Stan had been bright; Liston was
brighter, and had a Ph.D. in spite of it.

<p>

Soon he brought us early word that all 704 bets were off; that there was so
much confusion on both sides as to which orders were firm, and whether the
rather tenuous military priorities still held water, that a completely new
dispensation was ordered.

<p>

Firm prices, some quite different from the ones gossip and eager salesmen
had specified, would be announced soon, simultaneously at all IBM offices.
The first customer to have a firm, fully priced order at his local sales
office would get the first machine (after IBM itself, of course).

<p>

I had authority in Generous Electric to commit $250,000.  I had Charlie work
me up a firm order for the various pieces of three 704s, leaving the prices
blank for Liston to fill in.  I took this up to Dave and suggested he might
like to countersign it "although it is within my authority."  I'd kept him
posted, of course, and he had met Liston and liked him.  He asked, "Herb,
how much are these things going to rent for"?  "Something under $50,000 a
month each, Dave.  I have a letter here from the Cincinnati local manager
confirming that under the GE master agreement back in New York, I can cancel
any installed machine on thirty day notice.  So we're committing much less
than my limit."

<p>

He grinned at me.  We both knew the new building, the reprogramming, the
dislocations of moving out a 704 if we ever had to, would run to several
million dollars.  We were in the soup together on the building, anyhow.  He
signed: the best boss I ever had, even if he did make his managers play golf
together.

<p>

All was in readiness.  The announcement was scheduled for a weekend.
Everyone was poised.  I went off to a conference.  Saturday Liston zoomed in
to get the word.  Signals off!  Because of the problem of time zones, the
rules now read "first firm and correctly priced order time-stamped in New
York after the opening of business Monday."  Liston did the pricing exercise
and triple-checked it.  He flew to New York.

<p>

When 590 opened for business Monday, the salesman for our great rival Pratt
and Whitney was waiting with the papers for one measly machine, and the
order was stamped at the reception desk at 0916.  But Liston, an old New
York IBMer, had gone to the Wall Street New York office, which opened at
0830.  My hero!

Why did I want three machines?  Well, I needed one to continue to expand my
Evendale operation, one to replace the 701 in a year or two, when we were
finished reprogramming and tidying up the work then on it, and one for Lynn
- more on that in a minute.  Now for the first I genuinely needed Number Two
(IBM was to keep Number One, as in the 701 case - and for the same reasons).
The others could be further down the schedule, but I now had the theoretical
power to insist on getting Numbers Three and Four.  In fact, Poughkeepsie
got so good at rolling out 704s that a few later recipients had to warehouse
theirs for a month or two, at $1500 per day, because the accommodations were
not ready - so IBM would have let me stockpile mine, at the same rate!

<p>

Dave would probably have been amused.  But Jim LaPierre and his attractive
secretary had been swept away to higher office (literally; on one of the top
floors of 570 Lexington).  His replacement was a tough, tough young hombre
named Jack Parker who shot Kodiak bears to keep his managerial eye keen;
Jack would have had me stuffed and mounted too, if he had caught me playing
such games.  Charlie and I had worked out our bookkeeping scheme to
perfection, so we would have had no budget problems, but somewhere in GE the
cost of excess 704 power would have drawn Jack's marksmanship.

<p>

About our finances: I set a 701 rate before the machine arrived, and it
included the whole system (integrated peripherals, remember) and supplies.
There was a mechanism, seldom invoked, to charge for unusual amounts of
punched card use, including keypunching.  I set graduated charge rates for
people; the poor customer might have to pay Don Shell's rate and only get an
operator some of the time, if Don ran his problem.  Power and air
conditioning (and lots of air conditioning repairs) were paid by the
department, and I had a direct budget item from the department for no-charge
work: fiddling with Jingle Bells, and going to the JCCs and such.  Later
Charlie cleverly converted this to section overhead, and freed us from even
<a name="[-186-]"><font color="red">[-186-]</font></a>
that control; from Dave's point of view, we were self-supporting.  Needless
to say, Gerry felt very differently.

<p>

Second and other shifts cost me only half rate: $7500 a month per shift
(there were wrangles with IBM as Dave's finance man tried to play games with
the contract wording, over Charlie's and my objections).  But time on the GM
and WHQ machines cost the earth.  Nevertheless, we charged out more than our
total expenses, and at the end of the fiscal year we cut our rates and gave
back our surplus!  Inside AGT it was easy, but to return money to the
turbine division was incredibly difficult.  I sturdily refused to do it by
charging too little the next year, which was the beancounter solution.  I
wanted my, ahem, superb managerial accomplishments to be on the record.  And
the 704 was coming.

<p>

Everything we did was an accountant's nightmare, because every element of
the system was in flux.  Jack rented a 607 (like a 604, but with more
capacity) and ran the books for Charlie, and one day when Mr. Finance was in
despair at the clumsy service he was getting from the Division payroll
operation, we persuaded him to let us have a fling.  Somebody wired up a big
plugboard; Shirley Hanaford, one of my four Boston originals, who now ran a
keypunch and data transmission unit for Jack, hired another girl - and
Instant Payroll!

<p>

Parenthetically, there were errors the first week, and in correcting them we
made different errors the second week.  Then, smooth sailing.  Down the
river in a very different part of GE a huge mass of stupids from GE
Louisville, GE New York, Arthur Andersen and Remington Rand were trying to
make the Appliance Park payroll run on the Number Three Univac.  They tried
to write and check out an 80,000-word program written in one piece in
absolute!  I wanted to send help or give advice, and was very rudely turned
away; I've been badmouthing them for over forty years.  The central figure,
who had published his plans in advance in the HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW, was
banished after two years to GE Realty, where he probably bought swampland.

<p>

The 704 made it possible to charge separately for independent peripheral
operation, and its hourly rate was higher than the 701, but otherwise our
scheme was unchanged.  When the Computation Building, the first industrial
building in the world designed and built to house only computers and
computer people, was ready, we moved all the tattered troops across to
pleasant open spaces on the second floor.  I put the workers next to the
windows, and built enclosed offices for managers and supervisors down the
center (the view was dreary anyhow - and I didn't ask 'em)!

<p>

We had all new furniture.  It was a big order, and Charlie gave it to an
outfit - General Fireproofing, I think - who threw in two special desks for
the 701 and 704 consoles at cost [high], and decorator consulting for the
office space.  We ended up with 26 colors of paint.  It was very nice; Mary
Noble would have approved.

<p>

I had a corner office on the first floor, with Charlie next, and with our
two lovely secretaries artfully exposed.  Then came a small reception area -
we did not need separate security - which I outfitted with Herman Miller
ultra-modern furniture and tropical fish tanks in Charlie's wall (his
secretary's job description was modified to include fish feeding, and
professionals came up from downtown to do maintenance).  I had a Miller desk
and bookcases and
<a name="[-187-]"><font color="red">[-187-]</font></a>
such in my own quarters, and the end wall (no window) was
floor-to-ceiling off-white chalkboard.  No chalk rail; when I whipped purple
chalk out of my drawer and started writing on my wall it was a sensation.

<p>

By the way, I had that end wall made blank, and with knockouts in the cinder
block for the halls on all floors (and extra footings outside) so I could
double the building length in a year or two with minimal disruption.  We had
a hydraulic elevator with a special high door in the wall outside; the
elevator could be inched to any truckbed height.  A portable aluminum bridge
was provided.  The other side of the elevator opened on to our three floor
levels.  No more chain falls, and no Pete standing underneath!

<p>

I left the 701 in Building 300, and the horrid special air conditioning with
it.  When Jack moved the data transmission gear to 305 it made room for a
couple of desks for the "next up" people to sit at; we intended to keep the
programmer/operator concept alive for that machine.  But in 305, my new
building, he made plans for real operators; the unit was supervised by a
nice guy named Bob Mackenzie, who soon became a well-known figure in the
trade.  We vacated the quarters where my poor office had once stood, and
Gerry's people expanded into it with a sigh.

<p>

My adventures were not popular with my peers and their jealous minions.
When I was challenged in Dave's staff meeting about my wicked ways, I
produced figures showing that my own imaginative office furniture cost less
than their stodgy walnut desks, and that the fish maintenance was cheaper
than replacing the schefflera in the main building lobby.  "You don't need
to decorate up your place at all, Grosch," said Manufacturing.  "Bob, when
you have visitors from overseas," (he never did),"they want to go in back
and see how you machine titanium.  A lot of mine are interested in the
building itself; I had a chap from BASF Ludwigshafen last week who is going
to go home and build a bigger version, for the first IBM 709 to come to
Germany.  The non-Miller furniture is standard, just much better looking
than the stuff in 100 and 300; you can have the same when you build a new
building."  Neumann looked thoughtful.  "And two dozen attractive shades of
paint cost no more than the same number of buckets of this pukey green."

<p>

"Let's go on," interrupted Dave.  "Herb is within budget, and the place was
finished in time to take the 704; that's what counts."  But within weeks
after I and my contingent left for Phoenix the next year, the fish tanks
were boarded up, the lovely maple floors in the machine rooms were covered
with rubber tile, and the whole place was repainted one color.  Sigh!  The
way of the transgressor is indeed hard, or at least pukey green.

<p>

The LaPierre extravaganza was really scary: Watsonian, without The Old Man's
huge staff and its long experience.  And without the Waldorf, for sure!  Jim
was rightfully proud of the enormous shops he had left for Parker, but
decided to focus on the research and development facilities and do
manufacturing another time.  He invited all the top brass in the services,
all the airline presidents, all the aerospace company big shots, and all the
big GE executives.  I managed to add Tom Watson Junior and Vin Learson,
since one of the featured attractions was to be the new Computation Building
and the new 704.  There were to be six large parties touring during the
morning, followed by an elegant catered luncheon in 100.  The tour was to
take two hours, which
<a name="[-188-]"><font color="red">[-188-]</font></a>
meant the groups set out twenty minutes apart.  They
were to have fifteen minutes each in Building 305, so a dull explanation
would take too long - and also be harder for us than something lively.

<p>

We sat around a conference table and brooded.  We knew Jim was upset that he
couldn't also display the huge test cells in Lynn, which had now been rigged
to run mostly in the daytime.  And we had been doing almost-real-time data
reduction for those cells since late 1953.  The Lynn engineering people had
put funny A.D.Little analog-to-digital converters on the sensors, which
produced test data on punched cards.  A Lynn guy converted the cards to
teletype tape and put the tape on a private line to Evendale, where Jack
converted it back to cards and stuffed the latter in the 701.

<p>

"Why don't we convert the program to 704?  It's trivial.  Then we can move
the tape-to-card punch and the voice link into the machine room in 305,"
said Jack.  (We were still in 300).

<p>

"Not enough pizazz," I objected.  "How about closed-circuit TV?" said Chaz.
We all started talking at once.  Mind you, we had no building yet, and no
704, and no experience [1954] with private television.

<p>

I skip the hundred painful scenes over the next months when we accused each
other of being crazy.  The building got done, on time.  The Number Three
(Three??) 704 was delivered and rapidly checked out - no pushbroom antics
necessary.  The day before the great event the TV crews arrived in Lynn and
Cincinnati.  The scenes to be transmitted were picked out, and checked on
the Lynn monitor.  Nothing appeared on the screen in the 704 room.

<p>

Morning brought no improvement.  The TV people said not to worry.  "Happens
all the time.  We'll get it in a minute."  My guys were frantic.  "They'll
never make it," said Jack.  "Let me get in there," said Earl, our chief IBM
customer engineer.

<p>

We had fifteen minutes before the first and most important party was to
arrive: LaPierre, Parker, the Assistant Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the
president of American Airlines, and so on.  I got the gang together - all
but Earl, who was deep in conversation with the TV men.  "You've done great,
guys," I said.  "You did all the work.  Now it's time for me to earn my
keep.  Relax.  It's my baby."

<p>

Earl clucked to himself.  The picture flashed up.  The TV crew muttered over
the voice link.  Jack was on the phone we had been holding open for the last
hour.  "Ready for the test?" he said.  The door opened and in walked
LaPierre and the first party.

<p>

All six demonstrations worked fine, except that the printer ran out of paper
once!

<p>

Dave knew.  Whether Jim or Jack Parker ever did I rather doubt.  My little
coterie was absolutely shattered, but happy.  A few days later Dave said to
me, "About that invitation you had to speak at Cambridge..."

<p>

We have a lot of ground to cover before we can leave for Europe, however.
About that "Number Three," for instance: a month or two after the Land Rush,
while I was still gloating over my - well, to give credit, Liston's -
victory, Hurd came down to see me.  "Herb," he began, "Pratt and Whitney are
incensed at that timestamp business..."  I broke in.  "Cuthbert, if their
salesman had been as sharp as Liston, it would have come down to a tie
anyhow.  And I bet Liston was there at six, and would have won by thirty
seconds."  "Crossman and Ramshaw say their bosses are going to throw it into
a priority wrangle, and that might mean rearranging all the early orders.
Mr. Watson (he meant Tom Junior) is very anxious to avoid that."  "GE
priorities are as good as P&amp;W," I said callously.  "Let's wrestle"!

<p>
<a name="[-189-]"><font color="red">[-189-]</font></a>

"Now, Herb," said the worried Cuthbert, "you don't really want three
machines all at once."  "We have great big warehouses across the street, old
boy," I said.  "And I like it when Tom is anxious - it works out well for
the customers.  But I just might be persuaded.  Thing is, my bosses down
here are as pleased to get ahead of Pratt and Whitney as P&amp;W is angry at
being behind.  If we give a little - say let them have Number Three or Four
- I have to have some substantial advantage for GE in return."  "Of course,"
said Hurd.  "But they want Number Two.  We have talked at length with the
factory, and they can push Three up very close to Two."  (He probably meant
they'd slow down Number Two; nobody had firm dates yet).

<p>

"Amdahl says they are going to offer a second box of core," I mused.  "Paul
Armer says he is going to get a production version of the
photographic/graphic output unit he has on his 701 when he gets a 704.  I
haven't gotten over being angry about that, Cuthbert - you never gave us a
chance at that gadget, and our money is as good as Rand's."  "That's water
over the dam..." "Cuthbert, mein kind, I have a memory like The Old Man's.
How would you like a brisk rundown on all the dumb things Applied Science
has done since 1949"?

<p>

He was quiet.  "Now," I said, "if you guarantee delivery of Number Three not
more than two weeks behind Number Two, and if you guarantee a super
installation crew - remember, I will have a brand new building to check out
at the same time - so that we won't fall further behind, and if you put on a
second box of core, and if you give me the very first production graphic
unit, I'll take Number Three.  And if you will guarantee to slide me into
the queue for my other two machines on very short notice, I'll let you move
those two back also."

<p>

"I can't tell you now when the second box of memory will be available, Herb,
but I'll try to move it ahead.  And you shall have the very first one, and
the first graphics unit - even ahead of 590."  "It's a deal," I said.  In
fact, the second core came while we were installing the main 704, less than
a week behind the main shipment, and was working from the first days.

<p>

Ramshaw told The Band Of Brothers how he was getting the first 704.  I
smiled paternally and told them about the doubled memory.  It was 1956
before P&amp;W got one.  I told Cochran very privately what I had done.  He
approved, and I don't think he bothered Parker.  Gerry would have been
upset, but he didn't find out until the Building 305 dedication.

<p>

In the long run the AGT order resulted in Number Three in Evendale, Number
Twelve in Lynn, and Number Twenty Or So in Phoenix.  It speaks volumes for
my concerns in 1955 and 1956 that I don't remember whether the last two had
doubled core memory!

<p>

Allen Keller of the Medium Steam Turbine department was a fearful thorn in
my flesh.  He was a customer, yes, but he wanted his own mainframe -
<a name="[-190-]"><font color="red">[-190-]</font></a>
wanted it day and night, and twice on Sundays.  He was a workaholic, and
turned out report after report about his wild Expert System plans (he was the
expert) and his very genuine current accomplishments.  I finally took my own
successes in my hand and discussed it with the turbine division VP - a
wonderful man, but very much more conservative than LaPierre (remember,
though, he had supported Hans Kraft's efforts for ten years, and chipped in at
the very beginning of the 701 deal).

<p>

"MST doesn't really have anything like enough work to keep a 704 busy even
one shift," I said briskly.  "LST is reasonably happy with our service and
our rates, and they are nervous about throwing in with Allen's grand
project.  If it works it will be great for your whole division, but it will
take many more programmers than he now has, and more attention from
Hundred-Hours-A-Week Allen than even he can give to it, if he is also
installing and running a 704 shop."

<p>

"I have been cautioned by several of my managers, Herb," he said quietly.
"Could he do this on a cheaper machine, if we kept the Schenectady work on
yours"?  "There is a thing called the 650, an IBM drum machine.  Trouble is,
it would take more programmers rather than less, to squeeze what he wants to
do onto a weaker gadget.  The Rome [Georgia] plant has one on order, but no
one in GE has any real experience.  Drums are complicated; you have to
sprinkle the instructions around to reduce waiting for the next one to come
under the reading heads.  Also, he's really setting his cap for a 704, and
his planning revolves around one."

<p>

"One of the problems is location," I continued.  "He hates having a
permanent crew at my shop, and he wants to be right in there himself, at the
operating console.  Suppose I scout around for more 704 work in your
division, and in our Small Engine group in Lynn, which doesn't do much at
Evendale.  I've been planning to order more than one 704 anyhow; AGT alone
will load one to the gills in a year, and I'd like to turn back the 701 and
get out of Building 300.  You know Dave has been authorized to build me my
own building"?  "It was a seven days' wonder here," he smiled.

<p>

"I'll put up a 704 shop in Lynn, in your space or Parker's, and Allen can
have priority, and Hans and your other LST people can transfer their work.
And my guys will drum up Small Engine business; it should be very easy to
have at least one shift, from the very beginning.  I'm not worried about the
Evendale operation losing your business; the difference between two-shift
rates and three-shift rates won't ruffle even Neumann."

<p>

"Could Allen run it"?  "Not for me," I said firmly.  "He's a pain in the ass
as a customer, and would be even if I had a shop in Lynn.  As an employee,
he'd take more attention than all the rest of a 704 shop.  If you want to
get him a 650, fine; we'll put the second AGT 704 in my new building.  I
have a room laid out for it."  "He is a very valued engineer, Grosch," he
said, forgetting to use my first name.

<p>

Small Engine was the problem, really.  The Neumann/Cochran writ hardly ran
there; they didn't need variable stators, and didn't want to see so much AGT
Division money go into huge test facilities for supersonic and
very-high-altitude engines.  Still, Charlie had lines in, and Jack Hughes
was tied to the test cell group, which was Old Lynn but depended on
big-engine projects.

<p>
<a name="[-191-]"><font color="red">[-191-]</font></a>

The word was that there was dirty old unused space, which hurt in the
cramped Lynn Works, and nobody in Evendale wanted to spend money shaping it
up (the tide was running heavily toward Ohio, and didn't reverse until Gerry
took over AGT some years later).

<p>

I talked gingerly to Dave about it.  There were strong currents swirling at
the departmental level.  I worked up some back-of-the-envelope numbers.  It
was going to cost almost as much to gut a Dark Satanic Mill in the Lynn
River Works, and build a nice 704 shop in it - without tropical fish tanks,
for sure, Charlie said - as it had cost us to build a large new building in
Ohio.  Gene Gettel and some unit supervisors - we had several engineers, and
numerical analysts like Tom Glahn and Bill Dorn, with good credentials -
fanned out in Small Engine and looked for work that was well-funded, but
whose sponsors would not send it to Ohio.

<p>

I thought hard about the manager.  Gene was an obvious choice, but he was
settled in Ohio, and already at subsection level.  I could pay him a little
more, but he wasn't the sort of man who was dying for an extra buck.  It was
too soon for Dan McCracken, who was busy on his first book, or Bob
Mackenzie, who wasn't blooded yet.  I had a tough hombre of my own, looking
somewhat like a junior Jack Parker, who was struggling with the operations
analysis assignment - he was supposed to do technical as opposed to
financial audits, and every senior in Dave's outfit was ag'in the idea: "You
got to trrrost me, Dave," growled Bruckmann.  He didn't have the gut feeling
for IBM and the nutty computer trade I thought the job needed.

<p>

I had tried to recruit Allan Benson from Los Alamos, once for Washington and
once for Early Evendale.  He was the father of SHACO, an early user-friendly
Los Alamos interpreter, and with Willard Bouricius had taken over the
computing shop on the mesa from the founding fathers, Metropolis and
Frankel.  B&amp;B in turn passed it on to Dick Stark and Preston Hammer, and
then the techno-bureaucrats stole it away and never let go.  It must have
been rough duty; Frankel ran into security problems in the McCarthy era,
Metropolis went back to Academe and tried to out-Goldstine Herman (no easy
task), Stark turned up in an ungenerous part of GE, and Hammer spent his
later years trying to look more and more like Santa Claus.

<p>

I tried again.  Yes, Benson was having a personal problem: his ex-wife and
his new wife were in too frequent contact, trapped on the mesa.  "Generous
Electric will relocate you nicely to Lynn, dear boy," I said, "and one
bedmate."  For sure, only one, he said!  We put them up in a expensive hotel
suite while their duffel slowly wended its way to Massachusetts, gave him a
Grand Tour of AGT Evendale, had Marion's people work him over, and forwarded
him to the Lynn River Works.  With Audrey.

<p>

He did beautifully.  Getting away from Los Alamos - he wasn't really a Bomb
Type - released all sorts of energies.  I had to sit on his head a few
times; he was determined to beat my record, and I was having a rough time
even sustaining it myself!  And Lynn, unlike Evendale when I arrived, didn't
really want to be computerized.  He recruited like mad, and got some
excellent men and women (and a married team: new problem) who would not have
come to Ohio.  Some of them looked up from their coding sheets a few months
later and found they were in Arizona!

<p>
<a name="[-192-]"><font color="red">[-192-]</font></a>

There were plant architects and similar obstacles at the Works, but Allan
had Charlie and Jack Hughes, who genuinely sympathized with his problems,
and I could help with or through Dave.  About then Stan Rothman came back to
me for a third hitch, this time spliced to a nice Jewish princess who hadn't
adjusted yet to the problems of being a Tishman.  Louise took up metal
sculpture; Stan was full of Rand model-building but didn't find supersonic
flight all that compelling.

<p>

I was forestalling a lot of Lynn groups from getting their own computers -
shades of the Eighties.  In a guarded way their general managers were
grateful, because a mad scramble had been averted.  That didn't make them
really, really love me.  I said, "Let us tackle something for you that needs
a big computer and some expert programming.  Your own people are handling
the straightforward stuff nicely" (well, some were).

<p>

Soon I had a project for Stan.  He wrote a pioneering simulation of a major
machine shop, with probabilistic elements like machine tool breakdowns,
Monday morning absenteeism, stock inventory deficiencies, and so on.  There
were of course skintillions of routings possible - the computer chess sort
of thing.  He started with an intuitive plan (which meant they wouldn't be
tempted to fire the human planners - I understood the River Works) and made
random permutations, retaining those that improved the flow [few] and
discarding the others.  I helped him cost up a proposal to do it in real
life; his experiments made it likely that we could save fifteen percent of
shop time for computer costs of six percent, and the time element was
satisfactory; runs could be easily sandwiched in on Benson's 704 and
finished overnight.

<p>

They turned it down cold, and bitched to Parker about how much we were
charging them.  In a few days I came to realize what had happened.  The
planner in charge was unsettled by the prospect that his bosses could see he
had been costing them fifteen percent for years, with his best manual
schemes.  And the general manager had been hoping we would fall on our
faces, so his people could take over the 704!  It was all my fault.  Stan
had done a fine job.  I had been mousetrapped.

<p>

With a little help from Hans Kraft I got a hint of this up to division
level, and the grumbling died down.  But they never tried Stan's program,
and that hurt me almost as much as it did him.  It is described briefly in
Bill Bell's book on electronic data processing, the first ever published by
McGraw-Hill, and illustrated with a photograph of me talking to Ronald
Reagan in the 701 room!

<p>

Hans had become a family friend.  When I went to Schenectady his wife fed me
wonderful tortes made with ground hazelnuts instead of flour - the best I
have ever had, even counting the great places like Demel in Vienna, or
Sacher.  His son Franklin was learning to be a liberal - not easy so near
Albany - and enjoyed my often bizarre perspectives, and the tale about how
Dorothy and I had been amateur lobbyists for the Federation of Atomic
Scientists in 1946.  Hans seldom came to Ohio without bringing lily bulbs
for Dorothy; he was an expert gardener.

<p>

My dear wife was enormously supportive, and in an ambiance she did not
completely approve of.  We had rented a simple little house when we arrived
from Belmont, and in the slivers of time between my hundreds of trips, and
long hours at the plant, she and I looked for a permanent place.  There was a
<a name="[-193-]"><font color="red">[-193-]</font></a>
village north of town, popular with Procter and Gamble people, called
Wyoming.  It was the closest place of its sort to Evendale - "its sort"
meaning classical music and summer opera and European travel, and not just
the Cincinnati Reds.

<p>

We found a funny old house set 'way back from the road, on four acres.  The
root cellar, where the oil burner now lived, and the central rooms, were a
hundred years old, but a kitchen had been pushed out in the back, and a
pleasant dining room to one side, and one of the two bedrooms upstairs
enlarged and given a porch.  White clapboard, of course; in fact, much of
Wyoming had a New England flavor.  I put a big, slow-moving window fan in
the smaller bedroom, and with help from the many trees around the house
controlled the oppressive summer heat.  It was just what Dorothy wanted.

<p>

There was a tiny brook at the bottom of the steps up to the house, and
beyond it a cool glen where she put primroses.  Across the drive in full
sunshine she had lilies.  When her parents came for a long stay in 1954, her
father built a small greenhouse on to the back, facing our little locust
woods, and I put in heating cable.  The garage, which was really more of a
barn, was just right for my great New Yorker and a tremendous
industrial-type lawnmower.

<p>

I had a fun victory with the convertible.  There were no prestige plates in
Ohio in those days, but the state pattern was XX xxx.  I wrote to the DMV
and asked if there was any way that I could get GE 701, explaining why.
They replied that all prefix GE plates had by an old tradition been reserved
for Nela Park in Cleveland, the famous General Electric light bulb plant.  I
wrote to the Manager of Employee and Community Relations (Marion's official
title also), explained my great hunger, enclosed a spare copy of the "701 is
coming" MONOGRAM, got a charming letter back, and when the proper time
rolled around, received Ohio license plate GE 701.  How the Band Of Brothers
kidded me when I drove it to one of our IBM meetings!  In Evendale,
everybody was vastly impressed except Don Shell - and I imagine, Jack
Parker.

<p>

Against this minor pleasure, I had a tragedy.  Deo loved the new place.
Dorothy trained him not to wander up to the road, or to bark at the cow next
door.  He was a great favorite at our parties, and when he came to work with
me in Building 300 on weekends.  He fell ill - desperately ill.  The vet
immediately diagnosed hardpad, a form of distemper which the usual vaccines
did not protect against.  He will be happier at home, he said, meaning that
the little boy was going to die (we found out later the mortality rate was
ninety percent).

<p>

Dorothy and I did not give up.  She nursed him carefully; we loved him
dearly, and told him so in every way we knew.  He survived, although it was
a month before we were sure he was out of danger.  His little black nose and
the pads of his feet, and in later years his corneas and his kidney tissue,
deteriorated.  He could never catch a ball again.  But his spirit and his
sharp intelligence were unimpaired - and of course we both loved him more
than ever.  For my next birthday, which did not come for some months,
Dorothy bought me a small female standard poodle, chocolate brown.  Deo was
delighted, and immediately took charge.  We named her Carole.

<p>

Generous Electric had elaborate rituals.  Not as unorthodox as the Olympian
ones of Old IBM, but fascinating to somebody like me who had been, ah, out
in
<a name="[-194-]"><font color="red">[-194-]</font></a>
the world (I was a child compared to Neumann and Bruckmann, but I indeed
had seen more than GE).  One ritual was Required Togetherness, of which
Association Island was a variant.  Once a month in season Dave and all his
managers took an afternoon off and played golf together at a very fancy
country club in which Jim LaPierre, and probably Dave Cochran and the other
three local department general managers, had GE-paid memberships.
Fortunately I had played a little in college - it had been nice to be almost
alone on the wonderful University Golf Course in the morning, after working
all night on my thesis!  There were small side bets; like drinking on the
Island, you had to indulge, but not too much.  I was third worst of the
seven (Marion was exempted, although I'm sure she would have been welcome).

<p>

Another form of Togetherness was entertaining.  Each section manager - or,
to be exact, each wife - put on an elegant party once a year.  There was a
bachelor and a spinster among us, and they took us to restaurants.  Dave and
his wife Rosemary entertained last and threw a big bash, with a small
orchestra for dancing, at the country club.  Dorothy had brought nice china
and family silver to the marriage, and both by natural bent and scientific
observation had over our years together become a rather skilled hostess.
And I, in my travels up and down the U.S. for IBM and GE, had become
somewhat of a gourmet; Dorothy and I took visitors to the Maisonette
downtown, and not to Midwestern steakhouses.

<p>

We bought elegant Ohio crystal, and served aperitifs and two wines and
expresso and liqueurs.  I became a fair host; Dorothy, an even better
hostess.  I would bring back curiosities from my travels; I remember
Norwegian flatbread and - this was 1954, mind you - smoked whale meat.  Hans
was a mine of information about German cuisine, and liked Veille Cure with
his coffee (I had to bring it in from Manhattan); we had parties for him and
for our many Wyoming friends.

<p>

I remember with much pleasure a picnic for my gang and their families, at
the Wyoming house.  We hired a pair of ponies and a groom, and turned our
shady glen into a pony ring.  Even Don and Alice Shell approved of that,
although they stuck to ginger ale.

<p>

I assume LaPierre, and Parker in his turn, entertained one level up,
bringing in the general managers of the AGT departments and the division
lawyer and one or two of their very fanciest consultants - Black Mike
O'Brien, dean of engineering at Berkeley, was the one I knew best.  "And so
on," as the second half of the Augustus De Morgan verse says.

The fabric of the giant company had a few lumpy places.  In talking about
country club memberships I said "three other local departments."  Two were
AGT; the other was the ANP Department, which was suspended between the jet
engine and the nuclear businesses.  The initials stood for Aircraft Nuclear
Propulsion, and that stood for designing an engine where the combustion
section was replaced by a small nuclear reactor, running very hot.  Infinite
range - but what if the dumb thing crashed and split open, or got so
crunched up critical mass was achieved?  Cochran had been involved, and had
escaped to our side.  It was especially hush-hush, with AEC security and Q
clearances and so on.

<p>

I did work for them, carefully sterilized so it could run in our relatively
open environment (secret clearances only).  I had a top secret clearance for
other reasons, and the ANP security men got me a Q just in case - although I
never really used it.  One day our AGT security manager told me in hushed
tones my Q clearance had been suspended, and there would be a review.  He
was careful not to say it, but one security suspension often led to another,
in those disgusting McCarthyite times.

<p>

"Haven't needed it so far," I said carefully, "but let's set up some
informal talks and see what the problem is."  I had no Dark Secret, except
my rather extensive address book, but I knew Frankel of Los Alamos and
Clippinger, who had converted ENIAC to non-plugwire operation, were having
severe career setbacks due to security questions.  Oppenheimer was being
burned at the stake as we talked [1954]; I was aware of danger.

<p>

When I was president of the Rocket Society in 1951 I had appointed Martin
Summerfield, a distinguished young aerodynamics professor at Princeton, to
reshape and edit our journal.  He had done a fine job, and I
<a name="[-198-]"><font color="red">[-198-]</font></a>
continued to
feel good as each issue came to me.  He had a fairly close professional
connection, directly and through von Karman, with a brilliant professor in
his field, at Cal Tech.  This was H.S. Tsien, who had just picked up his
academic marbles in disgust and departed for Red China.

<p>

Anyone who had ever known Tsien was questioned.  I said I had never met,
talked or corresponded with the man; that I was confident Martin was "as
clean as General Groves," and that as a former president of ARS I thought
our editor and our member (Tsien, of course) were being treated shamefully.
I also made some vigorous comments on the persecution of Oppenheimer.  The
AEC security man did not care for my frankness, but said the important thing
was that I had had no contact "with this man Tsien."  My Q clearance was
restored.  It was an ugly, ugly time.

<p>

Maurice Wilkes was in full spate at Cambridge University.  He had built
machines that worked, he had coauthored the first book on programming
techniques, he had founded (and named) the art of microprogramming.  He was
already, in my early-1950s view, one of the three Great Englishmen (the
others being of course Babbage and Comrie), well ahead of Hartree and
Turing.  It was his technology that the amazing Thompson was building into
LEO; Maurice was, and still is today, a towering figure.

<p>

He had invited me to tell some of the GE story at the Cavendish Lab seminar
(his place on Corn Street not having a good lecture room).  After the
dramatic events at Evendale - the building, the 704, and the closed circuit
cliffhanger - Dave gave his OK to a long European trip "to survey recent
computer developments and speak at Cambridge."  Wow-wow-wow!

<p>

Dorothy's parents would take care of Deo and Carole and the garden.  I hired
a strong man to run the lawnmower.  We had been planning for some sort of
European trip for two years, and now we could take twice the time, and have
half our expenses paid.  I wanted to conserve my time for the other side,
and chose to fly, but Dorothy, who like me had dreamed for years of great
ocean liners and the broad Atlantic, chose the French Line Libert?.  I
put her on the train; she was thrilled but just a little apprehensive.
Having lived in Manhattan, and having been to several sailings of IBMers in
Watson Lab days, she had no trouble - and some of our old friends showed up
and gave her an impromptu farewell.

<p>

Three days later I flew to Idlewild, then a pretty primitive operation as
regards architecture, but much more pleasant nevertheless than today's JFK.
I transferred to Scandinavian.  Next morning I was in Hamburg, and at my
very first great European hotel, the Atlantic.  After a cautious night on
the Reeperbahn, which was even more wide open then than it is now, but much
more German, I upped anchor for Paris, where I had a leased car reserved.
Next day I drove in solitary ecstasy to Le Havre and picked up my delighted
wife.

<p>

In the early fall of 1954 Europe was magnificent.  There were as yet few
tourists; in fact, still many traces of the war.  And those few tourists had
gone home.  The roads, while narrow, were wonderfully empty.  We drove
toward the Alps, stopping at the behest of Michelin for star lunches and
red-labeled inns.  We went up over the Little St. Bernard and into
Courmayeur; the Mont Blanc tunnel had barely been dreamed of.

<p>
<a name="[-199-]"><font color="red">[-199-]</font></a>

I found a guide with a few words of English, and he and I did three climbs
together (I had brought boots and parka with me, and Dolonne, a tiny cluster
of houses across the Dora Baltea, made the best crampons and ice axes in the
world).  We were behind our plan, and scrambled over the Grand St.  Bernard
and across Switzerland and into the Grisons, then down the Inn to Austria.
We took hundreds of slides, wrote dozens of postcards, enjoyed ourselves as
never before.  Even our western trip to Palomar paled, although I yearned
daily for the Roadmaster or the New Yorker (but not in the narrow village
streets).  It was the high point of our marriage.

<p>

I had a list of computer people who had visited me at the Watson Lab or the
Barta Building, or in Evendale.  The one on the continent I remember most
vividly was the king of Dutch computing, Aadrian van Wijngaarden, whom I saw
occasionally for the next three decades.  He had built a little machine, the
X-2, with production in mind for 1956, and had already selected a managing
engineer.  And as was common in those times, he had built pieces himself,
although he was a mathematician; he had the fastest photoelectric paper tape
reader in the world, but looked with great care at my photos of the 701 and
the 704, with their card readers and line printers and magnetic tape units.

<p>

Perhaps more than the technology I remember the warm brown pub he took me
to, with a rug for a tablecloth - thirty years later, after having lived in
the Netherlands, I had one on my most-used coffee table.  The Mathematisch
Centrum was fine, but the pub was better.  We headed regretfully back to
Paris to turn in our car, and celebrated at the Tour d'Argent, where I
managed to stave off an importunate captain and get our duck ? l'orange
instead of bloody.

<p>

London was a revelation.  There were boarded-up bomb craters near
St. Paul's, where I climbed all the way to the ball below the cross.  There
were great-looking whores on every Piccadilly corner after dinnertime, and
Dorothy on my arm made little difference, but I reluctantly agreed not to
experiment.  Fortnums was in bloom, the famous restaurants were as
represented, and General Electric of New York, so named because there was a
British GE unrelated to the American one, came through with a much-needed
cash advance in curious black-and-white banknotes, at its office in Aldwych.

<p>

I had reserved an Austin A-40 at Godfrey Davis - no Hertz or Avis in those
days - and went to Buckingham Palace Road at the height of the
late-afternoon rush to get it.  I knew about driving on the left in theory,
but oh! the practice.  Took me an hour to get back to the Grosvenor House,
and I had to lie down before dinner!

<p>

I went out to the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington and met Charles
Goodwin, who had been Turing's boss in his last days.  He was head of the
Maths Division, and he and his lead analyst Jim Wilkinson had visited us in
the U.S. several times.  Charles proudly demonstrated the Pilot Model ACE,
which had only recently been unveiled.

<p>

He told me a great story: when the Duke of Edinburgh did the honors - ah,
honours - they were somewhat at a loss for a demonstration, not having much
I/O gear and precious little memory.  Finally they coded up a
day-of-the-week calculation, which allowed for the full leapyear business of
the Gregorian Calendar (you know 1900 was not a leapyear?).  The idea is to
enter a date,
<a name="[-200-]"><font color="red">[-200-]</font></a>
and the program instantly produces which day.  The only remote
date most victims can give the day for is their birthday.  Goodwin explained
this to Prince Philip, and asked for his birth date.  The guest drew himself
up, gave the requested date and then, with a barely visible grin, added "Old
Style"!  He had been born in Greece, which didn't go off the Julian Calendar
until 1923, two years after Philip was born.  Score: Royals 1, NPL 0.

<p>

Isobel Goodwin was a confirmed gardener, and took Dorothy off to Kew
Gardens, with an insider tour of Hampton Court Castle for both of us after I
had done enjoying the Philip story.  Nothing would do but we should stay
with them when we got back from Cambridge - I'd guess Isobel thought we were
in the London equivalent of the Wellington in New York, where unfortunates
like Charles and Wilkie and Les Fox were incarcerated by the British
consulate when in Manhattan.

<p>

We stayed at the Garden House in Cambridge, and loved it and the town and
the Cam and the colleges from our first glimpse.  My talk went well by my
standards, with distinguished professors from several colleges besides
Trinity, and outside visitors as well.  I had been wary of English lantern
slide projectors, and brought portfolios of photographs, and drawings of
Building 305, and even an organization chart (the latter, very bad taste,
I'd guess today).  I don't remember the exact title, but it was something
like "Industrial Computing in the U.S."

<p>

Val Cleaver, an early American Rocket Society member who was doing British
military stuff at De Havilland, sent a young man who asked me how many
"staff" I had.  I said we were still growing, but when Lynn levelled off and
I had filled out the technical library, which was just moving into handsome
quarters ("see the photograph in your portfolios") in the 305 basement, we
would have 175.  There was an audible gasp.  I explained that this included
secretaries and keypunchers, and two special janitors, but that made things
worse; there was one "young lady" in Wilkes' whole lab, and the researchers
punched their own paper tape - and very badly, Maurice said later: "the most
frequent character is all-holes" (no-op; used to blot out a mispunch).

<p>

Dorothy and I drove on to Oxford, mostly to enjoy the university but also to
see Leslie Fox again.  Les, a survivor of the Southwell civil-engineering
computing group of the pre-war years, was now planning for a mainframe and
teaching numerical analysis to his own disciples.  We argued about which of
us was the last to use addition-subtraction logarithms; we were both young
undergraduates in the Thirties, but I had Maxwell to rescue me.

<p>

I had seen my only surviving uncle, in hospital in London, and my mother's
old, old godmother for good measure.  I had done my talk.  The Austin had
survived a glorious trip to Cornwall, and back by way of Stonehenge.  It was
time to return to Very Different Ohio.  Dorothy packed carefully for the
Libert? at the Goodwin's - too carefully, as it turned out.  Isobel went
in to town with her and put her on the Southhampton boat train, and that
evening I discovered she had packed my air ticket!  But in those days air
travellers were treated well - Scandinavian reissued the ticket instanter,
even without a computer.

<p>

When I met Dorothy at the train a few days later I had very bad news for
her.  In the six weeks we had been gone, a developer had started major land
<a name="[-201-]"><font color="red">[-201-]</font></a>
fills on the property north of ours.  Her tiny brook was already ruined with
mud flows, and her lily field was threatened.  I had already begun
complaints, first quietly with the owner, who lived only two miles away,
then with the town, but it appeared useless.  The brook was too small to
invoke riparian rights.  Yes, we could sue for damages, but aesthetics were
not very persuasive against the property rights of a very rich long-term
resident.  That part of Ohio was Taft country, very conservative indeed, and
young GE executives were not yet particularly welcome.

<p>

Neumann's wife Clarice was a lawyer, but as a liberal not very heavy on the
Cincinnati scene.  She did her best, including personal appeals to
Mr. Rich-Rich.  I had aerial photographs taken, and we tried to get an
injunction.  Hopeless!

<p>

Dorothy's parents went sadly back to Pasadena.  Carole and D?odat tracked
sticky red mud up the nice long flight of steps and into the house.  Dorothy
found another psychiatrist, and wept a lot.  I tried to get her interested
in my newest hobby: sport cars.  It helped a little - got us away from the
house on weekends, if nothing else.

<p>

I had been watching the MGs and the older Jags, and now interesting cars
like the Austin-Healey and less-hot-roddy American specials were appearing.
Then like a vision from Heaven Mercedes brought out a stunner, the gullwing
300SL.  Oh, how I wanted one!  And I was right; over the years that car has
remained a collector's dream.  Well, it wasn't possible; even with my Elfun
Trust bonuses and several nice raises, one of them cost a good deal more
than I earned in a year.  Besides, with Dorothy so miserable...

<p>

<a href="computer/herb190sl-760.jpg"><img

 align="right"

 title="Herb Grosch and Mercedes 190SL - click to enlarge"
 style="margin-left:12"></a>

After we got back, however, the Masters Of Stuttgart announced a 190SL.  It
was less than half the price of a 300, and it was a rag-top - a lovely
thing, really prettier than the gullwing but of course much less muscular.
I rushed out to the local dealer, who mostly handled Lincolns, dropped to my
knees and begged him for Number One - shades of the 704 race!  Well, it
turned out that very few midwesterners had gotten the message yet, and I got
the first one from the Chicago regional importer.

<p>

We had gotten used to having two cars around when Dorothy's parents were
with us, and now I could take my pride and joy to work and leave giant GE
701 for Dorothy.  It helped.  And she enjoyed our new Sport Car Club of
America friends, and the rallies and concourses, and a bunch of fresh
magazines.  And we were unique; Daimler Benz didn't fool with its serial
numbers: we proudly displayed 000221.  Every screwhead slot was lined up.
The shiny black leather upholstery was stitched like a Herm?s saddle.
After a couple of months the dealer called and said The Factory (you could
hear the capital letters) wanted to replace my carburetor with an improved
version - "at no charge of course, sir."

<p>

The New Yorker had been a prize car as well, and I had had favors from
Chrysler, but those favors depended on my knowing Paul Nims, who ran their
first engineering computing shop and a CPC.  He had arranged for the company
Road Test Garage to look at the unusual semi-automatic transmission when the
Cincinnati dealer was baffled.  Now, I was just a very remote owner to
Stuttgart - about like the ones in Kenya, I'd guess - and still they worried
<a name="[-202-]"><font color="red">[-202-]</font></a>
about my carbureter.  I can't afford a fancy Mercedes any more - but I
haven't forgotten.

<p>

I haven't forgotten the GE scene, either.  Benson was getting his 704, and
of course I had lots of concern with how to give the bride away - how to
make the AGT and non-AGT general managers in Lynn happy at the new facility
in their River Works, while fending off Keller from too intimate an embrace,
and evading some Young Turks in Small Aircraft Engine.  There seemed to be a
lot more frictions than under LaPierre, but Dave pointed out I was up among
the tough players now.  I said they didn't hold a candle to Neumann, but we
both knew Gerry always played fair.

<p>

Before I bring on Doc Baker, who kept a coiled bullwhip over his office
fireplace [!, for the fireplace], I should tell an important story about
Cochran.  Like all his peers and superiors (and like me, as a matter of
fact), he travelled all over the GE map.  But unlike me, or Jim LaPierre, he
had small children.  And he loved his wife Rosemary very much.  One day he
went to LaPierre, just before the latter's elevation to executive vice
president, and said, "Jim, I enjoy working for the company during the week.
I don't mind travel - lots of it.  But the kids are at that age...  I'd like
to arrange things so I have weekends at home most of the time."  "I
understand, Dave," said Jim, "I lost track of my own youngsters, and Mary
had to play my role as well as her own.  I'll ask Parker to see what he can
do." And he did; Dave had a much happier home life - but he never made
Division!

<p>

Neumann made Division, and Group, and ended up with ten thousand signatures
in his goodbye book.  But he swept Clarice along with him, as he had swept
her off on their honeymoon, driving overland from Bangkok to Jerusalem in
1947.  I had no chance to sweep Dorothy along in that fashion, even in a
190SL, and I guess Dave didn't want that for Rosemary.  I don't know; I
didn't hear the story from him.

<p>

As I said, I travelled all over GE.  There was a special aura to Syracuse.
The plant was called Electronics Park, and it was the fiefdom of a tough old
guy named Dr. W.R.G. Baker - the Schenectady radio station WRGB was named
for him, uniquely in the U.S.  He was resisting the new Management
Philosophy, which said the Park should be three divisions, not one - his!

<p>

A laboratory there was building an unbelievable computer for Wright Field -
a copy of Howard Aiken's last monstrosity at Harvard.  Not only was the
design bad, but it was several years out of date.  Syracuse didn't know
beans about how to use a computer, let alone build one.  After I found out
some of the facts I began to agitate to do over the whole shebang, and my
cries mounted in intensity as I heard horror stories by dissidents, and was
shown a large box of mangled germanium diodes which had been replaced by
good ones in one of the, ah, improvements (the old diodes were made by GE;
the new ones I have forgotten - but not GE!)  It was to be called the OARAC,
as I remember.

<p>

All this would have been ignored if I had been a competitor, but everybody
knew I was the top user in Generous Electric, didn't claim to be a designer
or builder, and wasn't in line for Syracuse money or position.  I got in to
Baker.  He didn't like me.  But then, he didn't like many people, starting
with Harold Smiddy, who wanted to trifurcate his empire, and ending with the
local
<a name="[-203-]"><font color="red">[-203-]</font></a>
unions.  The bullwhip was an obvious Island present from groveling
managers.  The fireplace impressed me, and I told him so, mentioning my fish
tanks with some pride.  He looked a little less sour.  I told him his
computer project was dreadful.  He began to look positively pleasant; I
realized he was thinking of the guillotine he could set up near the
flagpole.

<p>

He grumped that there was a study going on about what GE - he said "The
Park" - should do in industrial electronics.  He would have the man in
charge send me a copy.  "Don't show it around," he said.  I told him I had a
Q clearance.  He didn't laugh.

<p>

Very soon a messenger [!] delivered my numbered copy, including a computer
study by one Claire Lasher, a marketing manager somewhere in the bowels of
Doc Baker's domain.  I read it with great excitement; it focussed on IBM,
said computers were the way to go, and that the time was ripe.  I wrote
Baker, copy to Lasher, saying I agreed but that the predicted total business
was low by a factor of three and the recommended buildup by GE Syracuse was
low by a factor of ten.  I also said Syracuse was an impossible place to
start the business - IBM was too close, the unions would kill everybody
dead, and the failure [!!] of OARAC would cast a long shadow.  I was
summoned to the presence.

<p>

"Cordiner has given us an OK to prospect," he said [not true, as it later
turned out].  "Lasher here says his predictions are all the brass in New
York will buy.  As for support, I'll give the new bunch what they need."
"If you start a department I'd like to help," I said.  "It ought to be
useful to have someone around who has seen a computer close up."  Lasher
gave me a slow smile; Baker ignored me (he was very good at that).  I made
it clear I was thinking of the general managership; he ignored that too, and
Lasher looked blank.

<p>

I talked to Dave.  He wasn't too upset to have me consider moving on; he had
asked me to do two private technical audits for him - that is, involving
outside consultants like Black Mike O'Brien and not my own Operations
Analysis group - and had not been impressed with the quality of the work.
Parker was a very tough boss.  What Dave worried about was that I would
strip the two 704 shops.

<p>

I said that New York would expect other parts of the company to help,
especially if the new outfit was ever to get out from under Baker.  "If
Baker asks me, Dave," I said, "and if I decide to go - and I'm not
considering Syracuse or Erie or such - I'll want Asmus, a couple of
operations people, and a couple of programming people.  Also if a few of the
juniors want to come I'd like to be able to accept them, either Evendale or
Lynn.  We are in great shape; business is booming; we sent a performance
bulletin on the new engine out to North American the other day as a deck of
binary cards, and it ran."  "Have you talked to anybody yet?"  "Only Charlie
and Jack Hughes, and Jack can't leave Cincinnati."

<p>

I poured out my plans and hopes and worries on Dorothy.  She wanted me to
fix the muddy mess in her garden, not drag her off to some new and less
attractive GE community.  I was being openly unfaithful to her on my many
excursions, our sex life having vanished with the sparkling brook and the
memories of Europe.  Her sessions with the psychiatrist were going poorly.
And it had been a long winter, and the primrose seedlings in her greenhouse
were not prospering.

<p>
<a name="[-204-]"><font color="red">[-204-]</font></a>

One morning I missed the dogs, who normally slept with me in the larger bed.
I found them huddled next to Dorothy in the small bedroom, trying to warm
her or arouse her.  She had taken twenty sleeping pills, and had been dead
for several hours.

<p>

Everybody was supportive - too supportive.  I was as guilty as a husband
could be.  I had brushed aside her needs, threatened her with further
dislocations, ignored fifteen years of a remarkably close marriage.  And our
friends were sorry for me!

<p>

Her brother Bob came for the service - he and Clarice Neumann and I, on a
warm spring day.  In a week or two it was as if she had never been, except
that the house was empty, empty.  A close friend who was now in my library
subsection took Carole, and a year or two later moved her with the family to
a GE location in Santa Barbara, where I saw her again.  I still needed Deo.

<p>

When the primroses in the little glen looked at their best, I scattered
Dorothy's ashes among them.

<p>

When I sold the house some months later, her greenhouse was a major
attraction.  She was never happier than on the day she went to Kew.  I
remember her a hopeful at Harvard; I remember her pushing cards with me at
midnight, in the Watson Lab; I remember her at her lovely parties.  But
mostly, I remember her in her garden.

<p>

I was not quite 38.  I had liked being married; it never occurred to me not
to marry again.  It was a positive thing, not that I disliked being alone;
in many ways I had often been a loner, in childhood, in college, in IBM.
Wyoming was a small enclave, and while friends produced a date for me at
swimming parties and such, the supply was limited.  I had those great gals
at the shop, but that way lay all kinds of trouble - although my lovely
secretary Jean Miller gave me fits when she came to work turned out like a
model, and sort of moving inside her then-fashionable sheath dress.  She was
divorced.  But what I really wanted was to have her come along with us if a
nucleus went off to the computer wars.  And we had a great relationship
already, which monkey business could only hamper.

<p>

When I lived in my Ann Arbor boarding house, one of my mates got married to
his high school sweetheart, just before graduation.  She had been going to
Ohio University, in Athens, and her attendants were not Ann Arbor girls.  I
found myself paired with a gorgeous creature who lived in Wauseon, a little
Ohio town not far south of Ann Arbor.  I managed four dates, borrowing my
father's car on one occasion.  She was a drama and journalism major, and had
been the lead in the senior play just before I met her; she had a difficult
love affair going, but found the world expert on Jupiter's eighth satellite
meager relief.  Something might have come of it, but Harvard and Dorothy and
Washington and the war intervened.  Her name was Elizabeth.

<p>

A few months before Dorothy's death I found myself at loose ends in Toledo.
I had given a speech or whatever, did not relish going down alone to the
hotel bar, was feeling inventive.  More than a decade had gone by since we
had exchanged letters or Christmas cards, but I remembered.  "Operator, do
you have a listing for an Elizabeth Yeager in Wauseon"?

<p>

I stayed over one more day.  Next night a very different woman showed up -
not the campus queen of East Lansing.  The face was sharper, more classical,
<a name="[-205-]"><font color="red">[-205-]</font></a>
under a black Garbo slouch hat.  She wore a black raincoat, and gave the
impression that there might not be anything under it (there was - but then,
it was our first date in over fifteen years).  High heels, which turn me on.
The hair was either platinum or prematurely gray.  And I was also changed;
success had marked me, and not only with a beard.

<p>

It was intense.  There was no flirtation.  We exchanged data: I was married;
a scientist; a manager; an experienced traveller.  She was unmarried; a
teacher; living with her aunt; hungry for adventure.  She was most
definitely not a virgin, nor was I.

<p>

Shortly we found ourselves sharing an elegant room in the Waldorf Towers.
Elizabeth loved New York in spite of the heat.  I loved Elizabeth because of
the heat - her heat.

<p>

After Dorothy's death, I played Young Lochinvar: rode out of the south every
weekend on my trusty 190SL, with tales and trophies of my latest conquests.
Aunt Grace was urging Elizabeth, I was urging Elizabeth, sex was urging
Elizabeth.  Then Baker struck.  There was to be a Computer Department.  It
would be located in Phoenix, Arizona.  Phoenix urged Elizabeth.  She
capitulated; I had a fianc?e.

<p>

It wasn't going to be simple.  It soon became obvious that I was not going
to be the general manager, and that the choice, one Homer Oldfield
(inevitably, in an American company, known as Barney) was not anxious even
to have me around.  He had appeared unexpectedly from the military side of
Baker's empire, and had negotiated a strange deal with the Bank of America
which was to be the dubious foundation of the new GE venture.  I pointed out
that he could not operate a computer department without a computer, and that
I just happened to have one of those scarce IBM 704s in my coat pocket.
Lasher must have taken a more conventional route; we were both accepted as
section managers in the new department - he as Marketing; I, Applications
(today we would say "software").

<p>

There were warning signs.  Barney, Claire, and the others who finally sat
around the departmental table in Phoenix, had all been promoted a level; I
was going sideways.  Most of them were Syracuse or General Engineering
Laboratory [Schenectady], and so were the other transfers, down to unit
supervisors.  Nobody knew much about computers, and the manager of the
engineering section was an analog man!

<p>

But my gonads were saying "Yes, yes, yes!" even as my IBM and MIT and
Evendale experiences were saying "Watch it!"

<p>

I had talks with Dave and Marion.  AGT would initially pay for relocation,
and for that of my small cadre as well, because the new department was not
yet announced or even funded (CD would reimburse most of the costs later).
I would take Asmus, Benson, Mackenzie, McCracken, six others from the two
locations, and Jean Miller.  Hughes couldn't come, Shell wouldn't come;
Gettel was an engine man.

<p>

I could indeed have the rights to the third 704, which had so far cost AGT
nothing.  And as a wedding present (said Dave) I could take my Herman Miller
office furniture, and the IBM typewriter I had had painted to match Jean's
dark red hair.

<p>

Marion agreed that she would ask Parker to permit my move to include
<a name="[-206-]"><font color="red">[-206-]</font></a>
my fianc?e, since we wanted to be married in Phoenix - and if married first
it would have been legal.  She probably didn't tell him my fianc?e had a
whole Victorian mansion full of antique furniture.  We covered transport for
Aunt Grace by Elizabeth driving her car West; my precious 190SL was to be
shipped.  Finally, Dave gave permission for me to give a speech on computers
and space exploration at the Rome meeting of the International Astronautical
Congress, which just happened to fit between my leaving Evendale and the time
Barney Oldfield was arriving in Phoenix.

<p>

In other words, a honeymoon.  I had done well by Evendale and its enormous
tasks.  They were saying thanks, and good luck.  It was the best job I ever
had - and you can see why I still enjoy calling it Generous Electric!

The General Electric Computer Department was a big, big secret.  And the
biggest secret was its location.  After Baker picked Oldfield, and after
serious negotiations had begun with the Bank of America, but before the
final decision to go ahead was taken, a task force from Electronics Park and
570 Lexington began the search.  I never knew whether outside consultants
were involved; by the time the good doctor and Brother Barney made me an
offer the location had been chosen - and indeed I would not have accepted
without knowing.  I was not about to plunge my hoped-for bride into a Utica
or an Oxford, Mississippi.

<p>

Before the team (and Oldfield) got to grips with special computer
requirements, there were some broad guidelines.  The company was very
anxious not to encourage further unionism, and was moving existing
departments south and new ones west, away from the baleful glare of the
Lynn, Syracuse, Schenectady, Erie, Cleveland and Evendale unions.  Also, as
I mentioned in talking about Watson Senior's very different views, GE did
not want to dominate any more communities.  That ruled out towns like San
Jose or Rome, Georgia where they had a considerable presence; in fact, it
also made the smaller towns a difficult choice even when GE was not already
on the scene.

<p>

When you add to that a general feeling even in 1956 that electronic futures
were rosier out toward California, and the specific desire as the search
wore on to be close (but not too close) to the Bank of America headquarters,
the number of choices narrowed very rapidly.  There were several good
possibilities, I heard later, in Texas and Oregon and California.  After
appearing to work assiduously over the thick reports, and making appropriate
visits to chambers of commerce and building sites, Barney chose what he had
intended to choose for family reasons from the very beginning - Phoenix.
The team and the GE authorities may well not have known of his preference.
I found out because when I began to burrow into the community I heard that
Barney
<a name="[-210-]"><font color="red">[-210-]</font></a>
had been in and out of Phoenix for many months, and even before the
formal survey had been chartered.

<p>

After I had accepted, Barney and I talked about dates.  I needed to go
early, I said, because I had to figure out where to put the 704; the lead
time was much more than for a building to (temporarily) house people.  "I
think you will want to be close to the college in Tempe," said Oldfield.
"Come out with me next week and meet President Gammage and some of the
Phoenix people who know about us."

<p>

The trip was a revelation.  I knew the naked desert from western trips, and
thought it magnificent, but I knew little about Phoenix and Tucson.  The
college was Arizona State, with buildings going up in every direction, a
student body at 12,000 and growing twenty percent a year, a rivalry with the
older University of Arizona in Tucson, and - need I say - great enthusiasm
for athletics.  The library was punk, the Ph.D.  level among the professors
low, and the research capabilities microscopic; there was a scorpion
laboratory.  Really!  Great competition swimming pool, though.

<p>

The other side of the coin was Grady Gammage, in his sixties but with a
thirty-year-old spirit - and a younger wife, and a little boy who was the
apple of his eye.  Over the next months we became firm friends.  He was
enormously proud of his school, which he had built up from a poor little
teachers college over a span of nearly three decades.  Before that he had
headed a still smaller college up north (which in Phoenix meant Flagstaff).
He was the longest serving college president in the U.S., yet a lot livelier
intellectually than most of his vice presidents and deans.  He was a key
figure in the community both because of his position and his seniority, and
was tremendously excited at the GE entry.

<p>

While Oldfield went off to look at real estate, which was the most popular
outdoor sport in urban Arizona, Grady showed me around his campus.  He knew
every palm tree, and there were thousands.  And every student knew him, and
there were thousands of them too.  He focussed on the new engineering
building, just undergoing checkout; some classes were already using it, for
classroom space had been tight all over the college.  He startled me by
saying, "Mr. Oldfield has arranged to use some of our surplus space when the
building is open.  He plans to put his engineers here in Tempe for a year or
two, until General Electric offices are ready."

<p>

In no time at all we were grappling.  I had a huge computer, more powerful
than all the others in Arizona put together.  I had money for the equally
huge rent.  I was planning to recruit lots of the kind of young men and
women he yearned to have at the school.  My personal credentials, and the
recent Rocket Society presidency, impressed him.  He wasn't sure at first
whether to believe my wild yarns about Evendale and Lynn, but I had brought
photographs, and blueprints of Building 305, and the 704 installation
manual.  Not one of his senior faculty had even visited Cambridge - and I
had lectured at the Cavendish!

<p>

He had a three-wing three-story engineering building with an enormous
air-conditioning plant.  And he had uncommitted building funds; large lumps
of money.  We sketched an agreement at that very first meeting, before
Barney even got back.  I was to have space for sixty people, and a nice
office suite for
<a name="[-211-]"><font color="red">[-211-]</font></a>
Jean and me.  The college would install the 704, including
a big electronic precipitator for desert dust.  I would pay the monthly IBM
rent, and for power and supplies.  I would buy the furniture, which would
belong to GE.  We would look at janitorial and guard services later, and
perhaps split them; the arrangements for the GE Engineering Section were not
far advanced, since the manager had not been announced.  Also when I got
Grady and his wife Kay away from Oldfield, I told them about my Great
Romance, and how Elizabeth and I wanted to be married in Phoenix and then
leave for our European honeymoon.  "How wonderful!" said Kay, "I can't wait
to meet your fianc?e.  Just think - after fifteen years, to marry your
college sweetheart."  I thought it was pretty great myself.

<p>

And Barney grudgingly agreed that the 704 would be the centerpiece of "The
Arizona State College Computing Center, Operated By The General Electric
Computer Department."  As I had pointedly remarked to Gammage, it would give
Arizona State the most powerful university computer installation in the
world, at least until MIT or some such got delivery of a 704 or an 1103.
After that, the precipitator was a cinch.

<p>

I drove all around the area, checked on housing, took lots of pictures for
Elizabeth and my little band of supporters.  It was indeed a paradise, if
you liked desert.  For a New Yorker, say, it lacked certain amenities.
Later on, when Elizabeth had become a committee chairman in the Symphony
Guild, I used to sit in the poor auditorium (right behind Barry Goldwater
and his wife) and think wistfully of Carnegie Hall.

<p>

Housing was simply unbelievable.  You could buy a small new tract house,
with full air conditioning and an in-ground swimming pool, for $12,000 - on
a quarter acre! True, the construction was tacky, and the pool was tiny, and
you were a long way out of town, and the cheap plantings would probably die.
Still...

<p>

<a href="computer/cheesecake-1000.jpg"><img
 src="computer/cheesecake-160.jpg"
 align="left"
 alt="L-shaped pool"
 title="L-shaped pool - click to enlarge"
 style="margin-right:12"></a>

I got the flavor of how insiders lived from Lew and Elizabeth Haas, who had
a lovely older place on the corner of Mummy Mountain.  There was an L-shaped
pool with a magnificent palm at each end, a connected guest house, a tiny
citrus grove with underground irrigation laid on, and a small corral and
tack room.  It was out in the open desert, with a view of the mountains to
the east where Frank Lloyd Wright had his winter quarters, Taliesin West.
To the southeast were the wild Superstitions, and four miles to the
southwest, the landmark of Camelback.

<p>

Lew was the paid head of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, and one of the
very first people to know about General Electric's interest.  I sat next to
the pool and told them about my conversations with Grady, and about my plan
to bring my fianc?e out.  Lew of course was wired in everywhere; he and
Elizabeth began talking about the chapel of the Episcopal Cathedral, and
whom we should meet before the ceremony, and where we should live.

<p>

Elizabeth Haas was in her fifties, a bit leathery for my taste but still
attractive.  She was an amateur artist and patron of culture.  "I shall
introduce Elizabeth to all our friends," she said.  "I know she will like
the Herbergers, who came here from Minnesota a few years back, and are very
active.  And Lew must introduce you to Dan Noble, who is the reason for
Motorola being
<a name="[-212-]"><font color="red">[-212-]</font></a>
here.  His wife was also a newcomer, and the pictures of your
Elizabeth remind me of how Doraise looked when Dr. Noble brought her out to
the house."

<p>

It was the first of many exciting Phoenix visits.  In the end Grady and his
staff offered my gang a small frame house with humidity cooling, adjacent to
the campus.  It was to be torn down at the end of the year for further
Arizona State expansion.  We were to occupy it from late August until early
November; as we acquired our own furniture and built up our staff, the
college would finish up our area (and my office).  The computer room and
associated spaces would be ready when IBM sent the 704 (Liston was aiming
for December).

<p>

<a href="computer/jeanmiller-760.jpg"><img
 src="computer/jeanmiller-160.jpg"
 align="right"
 alt="Jeann Miller"
 title="Jean Miller - click to enlarge"
 style="margin-left:12"></a>

Even Charlie, the optimist, thought the schedule impossible.  But I now
understood from Grady and Lew and other new acquaintances how fast
construction could proceed in Phoenix.  Grady, on the other hand, accustomed
to the leisurely - and I suspected, rather difficult - recruiting for
faculty, was startled at the figures I gave him for projected hiring.  In
the event, we recruited very rapidly, and Grady's people matched us with
space, even to having handsome drapes in my little office by the time Jean
arrived.  IBM was slightly late, but they were now used to putting in 704s
in the Wild West, and we easily made the date for Grady's rather elaborate
dedication.

<p>

It was a very comfortable feeling to have a Manager of Administration and an
expert secretary.  All the details of moving me out of my building in
Evendale [sob!] and my house in Wyoming were taken care of, including
shipping the precious 190SL.  At the same time somewhat more orthodox
arrangements were being made to get the rest of the Evendalers and Lynnites
out to Tempe; that included a great deal of computer duffle for the third
704, as well as families and furniture.

<p>

That left Elizabeth and Grace, up in Northern Ohio.  It was arranged that a
different crew and truck from the same outfit that was taking care of me,
would pack and move them and coordinate everything so the two vans arrived
at the house I had rented in North Phoenix the same morning.  I would fly;
the ladies would drive.  Chaperoned by Aunt Grace, we would stay at the
major downtown hotel (the Westward Ho, inevitably known throughout the
southwest as the Ho House), while straightening out the conglomeration, and
get ourselves rather elaborately married at the cathedral chapel - with
Charlie Asmus and Elizabeth Haas as witnesses, and the Gammages, and my
troops and their wives, and a couple of society reporters, to help.

<p>

Alas, no D?odat.  I had shipped the little boy, now in vigorous form and
good coat again, off to Dorothy's brother Bob and wife Pat.  He was to be
shipped back to us when we returned from the honeymoon.  Grace was dubious;
there had never been pets at the Yeager mansion.  To jump ahead, both women
fell madly in love with the little guy, and he was the center of the
household until his death in 1962.

<p>

Everything went as planned.  It was an afternoon affair.  Elizabeth looked
stunning in a short beige lace dress and sleek little hat.  We changed, put
our fancy duds in with the rest of the European luggage, picked up the
troops, drove hilariously off to the airport for a wedding supper, and an
excited Elizabeth and a horny bridegroom flew away to Los Angeles.  There we
boarded the SAS Transpolar Express, still in its first year of operation,
and took off for Copenhagen.

<p>
<a name="[-213-]"><font color="red">[-213-]</font></a>

We were in first class, and immediately recognized other ARS members, led by
Krafft Ehricke, also on their way to the Rome astronautical congress.  But
we had a berth!  The broad seats of the DC6-B made up into a fine bed, much
wider than on the railroad.  The airline assigned two pairs of seats in
tandem.  They were designed to lay flat; a double mattress came out of a
cupboard and was unrolled as the working surface, and a curtain was hung
from rails on the overhead.  Quelle luxure!

<p>

Several airlines offered the service on very long overnight flights.  You
paid about $100 over first class fare - I think that was per person.  Of
course the economics worked only if first class was not full.  And the whole
lovely custom disappeared instantly when the jets came in.

<p>

Takeoff was at midnight.  After a luxurious champagne-and-foie-gras service,
we waved to my envious friends - and believe me, it wasn't the berth they
were envying - and retired to our bridal couch.  There is a small but happy
society called the Mile-High Club; we joined it on the way to Edmonton!

<p>

After Greenland Ehricke bustled up to me and with European savoir faire
asked my help.  It seemed that the rocketeers had a pool going on whether
"the lovely lady" and I were married, or just very good friends - and needed
to settle.  "Yesterday," I said.  This was passed to the cabin crew, and a
night-long celebration ensued.  We rolled off at Kastrup at 0700 feeling
absolutely no pain - and of course I was anticipating further festivities in
Rome, as Ehricke was sure to pass the word.

<p>

Rome was interesting.  It was my first visit, and we had to go down to EUR
for the conference itself.  Elizabeth and I opted to pass up a papal
audience with the hundreds of other attendees, and took off for Capri, where
Elizabeth's friend there introduced us to Gracie Fields - much more
rewarding than the Pope.  Somehow or other I found the Applied Mathematics
Institute in central Rome next day, and had an amazing time looking at the
Ferranti Mark 1 Star, one of the first mainframes installed outside the
country of origin (another copy had gone to Kelly Gotlieb in Toronto).  The
director, Mauro Picone, had put his car and mad Sicilian chauffeur at our
disposal, and we saw the Eternal City as an Evanescent Blur.

<p>

I was much impressed with the two engineers in charge, Paolo Ercoli (now a
very senior IFIP dignitary), and Roberto Vacca.  The latter came to visit us
in Arizona next year (and again in Manhattan later).  He had a blacker beard
than mine, a lean body that looked great in our pool, and spoke six
languages well - so well that he wrote science fiction (and in the
Seventies, futurology) in English!  His father had been professor of Chinese
language and literature at the University of Rome.  Roberto could read a few
ideograms, and also was studying Russian - all this after a good degree in
electrical engineering.

<p>

We went back to honeymooning.  Elizabeth had found Roberto, ah, stimulating;
she was magnificent in Venice.  Somehow or other we found ourselves in a
rental car, and drinking triple brandy Alexanders "for the road" in Merano.
And after a while, in Amsterdam, where we took Canadian Pacific's flight to
Vancouver.  I had tried, but they had no berth service.  Ah well, we now
belonged not only to the Mile-High Club but to many, many lower-altitude
versions, notably the Black Marble Bathroom Club of the Danieli.  Believe it
or not, the flight put down at Churchill on Hudson Bay.  Our connection to
San
<a name="[-214-]"><font color="red">[-214-]</font></a>
Francisco was Qantas, and it was delayed; their agent put us up in a
lovely room at the Clift to await a morning flight to Phoenix.  I decided I
really liked honeymoons.

<p>

Now the serious work at the new department began.  Oldfield and his henchmen
had draggled in while my bride and I were enjoying Europe.  Our section grew
smoothly; we were used to each other, used to our work, accustomed to our
levels in Generous Electric.  My peers had problems.  Perhaps it gives a
perspective on Phoenix to tell about our Employee and Community Relations
chap.  He bought a very fine new house, twice the size of what he had had in
Syracuse.  It was fully air conditioned, and had a lovely lawn - he was "in
irrigation," which meant that twice a week in summer a secret agent crept
near his house after midnight and flooded his super-level lawn two or three
inches deep with water from the nearby canals.  One awoke to lots of
floating steer manure, the universal Phoenix fertilizer!

<p>

Art did not get a pool with the house, and having kids, immediately signed
with a contractor to have one put in.  It was great.  The bill was only
$3000; he paid willingly.  A few weeks later he was hit by suits for payment
from the subcontractors.  It turned out contractors were not bonded in
Arizona, and his had skipped town.  He paid a second time; it was a great
way to treat GE's professional interface with the community.

<p>

Dan McCracken was setting up to do programming for whatever hardware the
Computer Department chose to build, and also (since he was becoming well
known around the computer community as the author of the first U.S. textbook
on how to program) as my manager of training.  About this time we all began
to encounter Barney's management method, which was to pit against each other
the people who worked for him.  Dan discovered that he had a rival in the
engineering section, and another much more capable one in Palo Alto.

<p>

Palo Alto?  Well, it turned out that while the Computer Department had an
engineering group in Arizona - in fact, just one wing away from my 704 in
the Tempe building - most of the actual work on the Bank of America contract
was being done elsewhere.  The bank was represented by a strong guy named Al
Zipf, who over succeeding years rose to its highest operating levels in San
Francisco.  He had hornswoggled Hayseed GE into a weird deal that I never
fully understood - it speaks volumes about Barney's style that repeated
requests to him, to Lasher, and to the poor dumb Finance man never produced
a copy of the contract for me to look at.

<p>

Roughly, the bank had all rights to MICR, Magnetic Ink Character Recording,
the ugly little numbers and symbols that lurk along the bottom edge of your
checks.  This had been developed by the Stanford Research Institute over
several years; that story has never been told in full, but I suspect it is
fairly dreary.  The package as the Hayseed Boys first saw it was an ink with
magnetic properties, an eyeball-wrenching font of the ten digits and four
special characters, and (as the Patent Office might have said) electronic
means to read and interpret a line of MICR type.

<p>

An amazing effort on the part of the ABA (American Bankers Association) was
on the verge of getting all North American banks to accept the shape of
<a name="[-215-]"><font color="red">[-215-]</font></a>
the characters, their placement on the check, and the magnetic properties of
the printing ink, as an official standard.  I was a major figure in computer
standards eleven years later, and nothing I saw or did in that horrid arena
lessened my wonder at the ABA achievement; it was not far short of a miracle.

<p>

Well, Zipf looked first at National Cash and IBM, both heavily involved in
bank hardware.  They listened to his proposals, snickered gently - they were
wrong about the technology, tacky though it was, but right about the terms -
and shooed him away.  Several companies later he tripped over GE Syracuse,
which had been ordered by Doc Baker to put IBM out of business.  Soon!  In
spite of the assurances he was giving me, Baker didn't want to spend much up
front, either.  My idea would have been to build up a powerful mainframe
capability, hiring outsiders like Haddad or Amdahl, and absorbing the first
dozen machines into GE enterprises.

<p>

You could figure on a big drain - a commitment of 'way over a hundred
million pazoozas before the first successful dinosaur was hatched.  And IBM
was rolling, and even Rem Rand was selling everything it could make, whether
in Philadelphia or Minneapolis.  A large part of Baker's personal earnings
would go down the tubes.  Sure, a decade ahead, GE would make a fortune,
maybe.  But WRGB would be retired, clutching his diminished sack of
doubloons to his still-vigorous bosom.  Not bloody likely, as my British
friends would have said.

<p>

Now, a Gerry Neumann would do it in a minute.  A Jim LaPierre might do it -
he was very careful about overall company finances.  I would do it in six
seconds.  But none of us were involved.  Oldfield, or more likely a
consultant or one of Harold Smiddy's spies, brought the word about MICR.
The bank had gotten its act pretty well together, after several rejections;
what they proposed was now rather attractive on the surface.  They would
give the new General Electric activity a contract for the first twenty MICR
systems, and then allow GE to sell on the open market to other banks and
financial outfits.  There probably was a clause about California
competitors; I never knew.

<p>

In return, GE was graciously permitted to buy the rights to the MICR
technology, probably for more than the Bank of America had paid.  I came
late to the fray; the contract signing was in final stages before I almost
accidentally tripped over the Palo Alto shop and saw the ink, the font and
the readers.  In my usual suave way I said to my host that it looked nutty.
"The coming technology is optical, for Gossakes, and the next tribe of
computers will be fast enough to analyze any reasonable font, not just this
hunchbacked thing."  I was right about optical, wrong about analysis; it was
the end of the Sixties before a single-board microcomputer got both powerful
enough and cheap enough to read, oh, defective typewriting.

<p>

The SRI stuff did not include a dedicated computer.  GE would develop that,
and have the rights to its probably rather primitive innards.  And since
delivery of the first system was less than two years away, there would not
be time to build up a mechanical design and manufacturing group; the check
handling equipment was therefore subcontracted to Pitney-Bowes, rather
secretively.  They were children compared to IBM, I said; the comment was
not well received.

<p>

Obviously it would help the GE group to be near Stanford, but Barney
<a name="[-216-]"><font color="red">[-216-]</font></a>
wanted the main operation to be in Phoenix.  So he set up a shop in Palo Alto
to do the MICR work and plan the computer, with the intention to move
everything to Phoenix two or three years down the road, and to do all the
manufacturing and assembly and test there.  When the time came, almost all the
good people protested vigorously, and many of them left.  For one thing, many
of the group had joined because they liked the San Francisco area, and
especially the Peninsula.  And by that time - it was more like five years, as
I remember; I was living in Europe - the sharper individuals could see, as I
had seen in 1957, that poor old General Electric was not going to put IBM out
of business, or even scare them as they had in the beginning.

<p>

There were a dozen reasons why the GE entry was doomed.  A great deal
depended on Oldfield, and he was a disaster.  Money was needed in much
larger quantities, especially to build up marketing and sales.  Lasher had
hired a former taxicab radio peddler to run the latter subsection, having
found him in one of Baker's remoter enterprises, and the next year sent him
and his people out to call on some of the most sophisticated banks in the
United States.  In competition with Watson's Best!

<p>

Two central elements of the Smiddy/Cordiner philosophy were especially
damaging.  One was decentralization; the tiny department had to pretty much
fend for itself.  In the Watson empire, or in many other large companies, a
venture as important and as vulnerable would have nestled in the bosom of a
rich part of the corporation, and drawn on mature services already
established.  For instance, a really major press campaign would have been
mounted at announcement time, and again, separately, when the story of the
Bank of America contract was ripe.  Barney had neither the personal
inclination, the staff or the money; there was a poor little press release
in October or November [1956], which nobody except IBM paid much attention
to.  There was no computer press as yet, which made it worse.

<p>

Mostly as a consequence of the GE philosophy, Baker was retired from his
Electronics Park and other fiefdoms, and his realm split into three standard
GE divisions: industrial electronics, military electronics, and controls.
The first was awarded to a Harold Strickland, who also turned out to be a
disaster - and the Computer Department was in that division.  Harold was
nervous, financially conservative, and knew absolutely nothing about digital
computers.  He didn't even get what was left of the two Wright Field
projects, the analog jet engine simulator or the Aiken Mark IV replica,
OARAC.

<p>

There was another element of the GE credo that had far greater consequences
for the huge company than decentralization (which indeed was a very good
thing for most parts of the outfit).  It was that there was a professional
skill called management, that it could be taught - the MBA frenzy was well
under way - and supremely important for computer futures in General
Electric, that a trained manager could manage anything.

<p>

The company was now committed simultaneously to three enormously difficult
technical ventures: computers, jet engines, and nuclear energy.  In the
difficult, and in the end humiliating, years to come a succession of expert
managers were given control of the computer enterprise.  Until the end, not
one of them knew anything at all about the field when he assumed the
<a name="[-217-]"><font color="red">[-217-]</font></a>
mantle - not design, not construction, not utilization (and in a world
dominated by IBM, not marketing!)

<p>

When it was almost certainly too late, at the end of the Sixties, somebody
up topside recruited John Haanstra from IBM.  John was great; would have
been just the guy to lead us in 1956.  He was killed in an airplane crash
not long after the appointment - a very considerable loss to the trade, as
well as a human tragedy.  He was succeeded for a few months by Stanford
Smith, out of the New York staff function, whose earliest management success
was transferring the Outdoor Lighting Department to Carolina.  He sold the
operation to Honeywell.

<p>

The pattern repeated, not quite so disastrously, in what was in those days
called atomic power.  The competition was not as overwhelming as IBM in
computers, or even as strong as Pratt and Whitney - only Westinghouse and
such.  But the same kind of certified managers with no real knowledge of the
business or the technology held GE back badly in that field also.  They
still have a presence, but of course the prospects have dwindled away.

<p>

The kind of special skill that is taught, in Cambridge and Stanford and
Crotonville, is the less important part of management.  What both Watsons
had, what my nemesis Vin Learson had, what John Haanstra had, was
leadership.  The men selected to run the computer and nuclear businesses in
GE were certified managers in the Smiddy sense, but they couldn't - and
didn't - punch a way for their troops out of a paper bag.

<p>

Which brings up jet engines, the first of the three challenges.  There was a
Maximum Leader (we will meet another one in the next chapter).  He was in
his own right the best designer of his thunderous beasts in the whole world.
He was a fantastic leader; many of his managers refused promotion up the
professional management ladder in GE to stay with him, and some of them were
still there when he retired over twenty years later.  This was of course
Gerhard Neumann, who features so often in this book not only because I
admired him as a human being, but because he remains to this day the key to
how General Electric could have succeeded in computers.

Pratt and Whitney was tough, and had almost as firm a grip on the engine
business worldwide as IBM did on computers.  Gerry shouted "Charge!", and
the whole bunch - subsection at first, then section, then department, then
division, and in the end a forty thousand man group - followed him cheering
up the steep hill.  In mid-charge GE tried to take him away for better
things: Crotonville, a major staff job, a promotion into some other division
or group managership.  He refused pointblank.  "I am going to build the best
engines in the world," he said, "and right here in General Electric, by
God!"  And with backing from Jack Parker and Jim LaPierre, he hung in there.

<p>

My dream for over thirty years, from 1954 or so, long before it was
possible, to this minute, when it is thirty years too late, was to do the
same thing for GE in computers.  I had the simple management skills, I had
the gut knowledge of the technology and I was, on a smaller scale than Gerry
perhaps, a Great Leader.  There were two reasons why I never did so; the
minor but not negligible one was that I was a hedonist.  I loved my
pleasures dearly, from reading about bookbinding in the Widener Library to
making love to exciting women - wives and lovers and casual acquaintances
and professionals.

<p>
<a name="[-218-]"><font color="red">[-218-]</font></a>

Neumann lived with enormous gusto, had a wonderful wife (but only one -
there I bested him), but his drive to be King Of Jet Engines was paramount.
Perhaps if I had gone up a notch further, perhaps if Dorothy had lived, I
too might have come to put computers first.

<p>

But there was something else lacking, and that was not at all my fault.
What GE needed in 1956 and 1957 and 1958 was a powerful hardware man.  Gerry
could lean over a drawing for a minute or two, and then say to his engineer,
who had spent days of effort and a great deal of expensive 701 time on an
important engine bearing, "Jim, that doesn't look right.  Check it again,
right away!"  If the Computer Department had had a man who could have done
the same thing with electronics, and if he had been a leader strong enough
to get rid of the Barney types and commandeer the department, GE might have
made it.  I was, unfortunately for General Electric and for me, not such a
man.

<p>

I tried to persuade Oldfield to bring in a really powerful designer, and
actually got so far as to ship in Ralph Meagher, the father of the ILLIAC I
(the first of the von Neumann machines to do useful work).  Ralph was no
longer at his best, and Barney didn't think he needed more top engineers
when he had Ken Geiser, who ran the Tempe crew, and Bob Johnson, who was
designing the bank machine in Palo Alto.  I should have tried with Gene
Amdahl or Jerry Haddad.  At least I could have been more supportive of
Johnson, but Barney had set me against Bob by setting Dan McCracken against
Joe Weizenbaum, and I was a detractor instead of a supporter.

<p>

Some years later one of the Founding Fathers of our business coined an
aphorism - not at all a part of the Smiddy/Cordiner lexicon - that caps the
story of the GE failure in computers.  This was Bill Norris, boss of Control
Data and of several predecessor outfits before it (he figures prominently in
my stories).  He said:

<p>
<blockquote><big>
"A necessary but not sufficient condition for succeeding in 
the computer business is to be completely devoted to it."
</big></blockquote>
<p>

Generous Electric made steam turbines and nuclear reactors and jet engines.
It made electric blankets and refrigerators and a thousand kinds of light
bulbs.  It had a major financial operation.  In later years it even got into
mining and such.  No management apparatus could give enough attention, and
enough funding, to something as specialized as computers, and also operate
the rest of a gigantic, diversified company - at least, not unless it had a
Gerhard Neumann.

<p>

RCA failed.  Siemens failed.  Hitachi goes very nicely indeed, but Japan is
a very unusual milieu - and even so I place Hitachi well behind Fujitsu and
NEC worldwide.

<p>

To have half of your business in computers is not quite enough.  Xerox
failed.  Sperry failed.  Honeywell failed.

<p>

Complete devotion is not enough; ICL is a case in point.  Norris' own
Control Data came down with a crash after the beancounters drove him out.
Thousands of us waited with bated breath to see what Boomtown Blumenthal was
going to do with Berry (or was it Spurroughs)?

<p>

Anyhow, as regards GE Bill Norris was right.  It never gave undivided
attention to computers,
<a name="[-219-]"><font color="red">[-219-]</font></a>
and in the end it had to give up.  I was to come back again [1965 and 1966];
I was to have a chance to look at their Bull and Olivetti ventures from the
inside.  I still liked the parent company very much - but I could see it was
hopeless.

I had done what I promised Baker and Oldfield I would do.  I had brought a
hard-to-get 704 out to virgin territory.  I had installed it in an elegant but
practical setting at the college, the center of intellectual excitement in the
Phoenix area - which, with all due respect to my new friend Grady Gammage, was
not saying much!  And I had done it without spending important GE money or
time.

<p>

I had staffed it, in an area where computer experience and professional
expertise were as scarce as forest glens and sparkling brooks.  And not just
with Evendale veterans like Charlie Asmus and Dan McCracken, or Lynn veterans
like Al Benson, but with sharp Easterners who had not worked for GE before,
and with a little group I had stolen away from Tucson (and in a sense, to
Grady's considerable pleasure, from his rival institution).

<p>

The computer and the people were ready to go - ready to do heavy design work
for the Computer Department's engineers, ready to help Arizona State in
administration and research, and to contribute at least some specialized
instruction.

<p>

And when we were ready, Oldfield and his poor second-rate crew didn't want us!
The engineering gang in Tempe hadn't the faintest idea how to use a computer
to design another computer, and were too busy doing it by hand to find out.
The group Bob Johnson had pulled together independently in Palo Alto, which
included the young and pugnacious Joe Weizenbaum (and Arnold Spielberg, father
of "Jaws/Close Encounters" Steven Spielberg), was a different matter.  Egged
on by Oldfield, they regarded us as competitors rather than as a powerful and
friendly asset.  They used local 650-size computer facilities at SRI.

<p>

So here we were, costing the earth - $43,000 a month IBM rental, just for
starters - and producing almost nothing.  We did a few things for the college,
notably a very early automation of their convoluted fall registration process,
<a name="[-222-]"><font color="red">[-222-]</font></a>
and tried to do a traffic flow simulation for the community, but those were
gratis.  It was clear Oldfield would like to shut us down, and eliminate my
croaking about IBM research and IBM design techniques and IBM marketing
skills, and Computer Department deficiencies.  He was waiting for his boss, GE
Industrial Electronics Division vice president Harold Strickland, to order him
to do so for cash-flow reasons, thus avoiding any suspicion that Barney had
hung it on one of Jim LaPierre's bright boys.

<p>

I had brought all those great guys and gals from Evendale and Lynn, and had
hired several dozen more, and uprooted them from mature communities.  Now they
were all out in the desert, light-years from computerdom.  If GE shut us down,
yes, almost everyone would get another position somewhere; a few would be
transferred to Palo Alto, probably, and our two loveliest secretaries would
have many offers - some, even, of jobs - in the Phoenix area.  But I had
promised something a lot better.

<p>

Toward the end of the Evendale operation we had been doing a rather sizable
service business for other departments of GE, and (cautiously) for a few
outsiders, mostly educational or governmental, and often gratis or at special
rates.  And for many years I had been aware of Comrie's London outfit, and of
Bill Bell's Telecomputing shop in California.  Based on that awareness I had
proposed the Washington operation to Tom Junior and Red LaMotte.  So...  could
I dig up enough service bureau business to support the troops and the 704?

<p>

I would get little encouragement from Oldfield, clearly, and nothing from any
other section of the department, even Marketing and Accounting and Legal.  On
the other hand, Strickland would never let them actually turn away money!  And
the charter I had written for my outfit clearly envisaged service work, and
for a fee - although I had expected it only as a filler while the design boys
in Tempe and Palo Alto got up to speed.

<p>

I first looked around locally.  Elizabeth and I, with support from the
Gammages and the Haases, had moved quite a way into the social scene, and were
doing for GE in that milieu what Barney Oldfield and his wife had to avoid.
Barney was of course burrowing into the business power structure, the
all-male, hondo-wearing fraternity: Ford dealers and other merchants, and real
estate sachems.  There was an upper crust to this structure, however, notably
two or three bankers, Barry Goldwater and the mayor and the governor, and one
or two old-settler families, and Grady was a much-liked but unconventional
member (unlike the others, he was not a millionaire; had been too busy
building up the college and interfacing with Frank Lloyd Wright and the few
other winter intellectuals to make money).  So I had an independent entree
upstream of Oldfield.  Cautious inquiries, though, soon made it clear there
was little big-computer work to be had locally, or elsewhere in Arizona.

<p>

Motorola, which was in Phoenix because an early-hi-tech executive named Dan
Noble liked it better than Chicago, was making simple solid-state devices.
Goodyear and AiResearch had aerospace activities nearby, and Hughes was in
Tucson.  They all had small computers and needed little more.  Fort Huachuca,
from which I had extricated Fred Thompson And Co., was so remote in every
sense from the MIT/Rand/Lockheed kind of excitement that
<a name="[-223-]"><font color="red">[-223-]</font></a>
only the most
persevering courtship was likely to produce contracts.  Also the scale was
wrong.  We needed something massive.

<p>

General Electric itself was sort of out-of-bounds.  I had left two strong
shops behind in Ohio and Massachusetts, with the tacit understanding that the
new outfit in Arizona would not compete, at least for eastern business.  True,
I was in another division now, but there were people like Gerry Neumann and
Jim LaPierre high in GE whose opinion I much valued.

<p>

Aerospace was booming, as I well knew from Evendale experience.  And Phoenix
was close to the California centers.  Problem was, those production and
development and research outfits were well-equipped already, and leaders in
704 and pre-SHARE circles.  I and my people were as good as the best of them -
but not outstandingly better.  What I needed were potential clients who had
giant growing pains, enough sophistication to recognize our expertise, but not
so much as not to need it!

<p>

I had kept a few warm friendships from the early American Rocket Society days.
I had started the first ARS professional journal, I had broken the deadlock
between opposing industrial outfits, I had linked us more firmly to the Brits
- and gotten friendly with Arthur Clarke and Val Cleaver in the process.
There were a few tattered IOUs still extant.  Figuratively speaking, I leafed
through them.

<p>

Soon I found myself in Huntsville.  Sputnik had not yet gone up.  The American
space program was all askew.  Wernher von Braun and his Germans, aided by
thousands of confused but enthusiastic Alabamans, mismanaged by the Army's
Ballistic Missile Agency, and hemmed in by interservice rivalries, had
designed and built, and to a degree tested, the big Jupiter missile (later to
be called Redstone, for the Huntsville facility).  With relatively inexpensive
special stages, it could put a simple satellite in orbit.  But the mission had
been assigned instead to the Navy, which was fuddling with a much smaller
rocket and, inevitably, a much smaller satellite.  Without the V2/White
Sands/ABMA infrastructure, and without von Braun's leadership and the talents
of his team, the Navy was falling behind.  (And that October [1957], the
Russians would win).

<p>

Helmut Hoelzer, who ran the big ABMA computer shop - IBM 704s, with 709
horsepower on order - took me aside.  "Herb," he said, "the boss and I have a
problem with the Army and the Civil Service people.  I have money to rent
computers and pay operators and programmers, but they won't give us the civil
service slots to hire any.  And Dr. von Braun has this problem everywhere, not
just with my place, so I can't beg slots from other laboratories or the test
stands."

<p>

"General Electric" (I probably said "Generous Electric," although Oldfield was
rapidly souring my enthusiasm)," is a very attractive employer.  Suppose the
Computer Department were to hire away most of your present computer people,
professionals and keypunchers and janitors alike, and with them - and a few
old hands from Phoenix - operate your laboratory as a contractor.  We would
give pay raises on merit, instead of by the calendar" (that was code for "we'd
pay `em all more"), "and we have extremely good benefits for those who like
such things, and a chance to be promoted elsewhere in the giant company for
those who are more ambitious."

<p>
<a name="[-224-]"><font color="red">[-224-]</font></a>

"It would have to go out for bids," said Helmut somewhat doubtfully.  "Think
nothing of it, old friend," I said.  "I write great proposals"!  We talked it
over with Wernher, who looked a little owlish - he had not survived Peenemunde
and PAPERCLIP unscathed - but admitted it was worth trying.  I took my
tapemeasure out, so to speak, and with cautious help from Hoelzer made
estimates of how many and how much.

<p>

"You mentioned needing 704 time while IBM ships you more stuff," I said.
"Now, I have spare capacity on the Tempe machine, and pioneer experience at
sending data by transceiver.  If we make you an acceptable facility management
offer, I'd want to sell you some 704 time at standard rates.  Needn't be part
of the operations contract - just a time-and-materials sort of deal - but I'd
want Wernher to understand the arrangement."

<p>

That was code too: it said that I would bid carefully for the main contract,
but wanted a short-term sweetener to dangle in front of my bosses.  I assumed
Hoelzer knew there were problems in Oldfield Country, or would soon find out.

<p>

The idea had real merit, entirely aside from my personal necessities.  What
von Braun could do was to take the slots freed by the new arrangement, fill
some with new hires for, say, Oswald Lange's big analog and controls lab next
door - I had my eye on that too - and use those slots with less specialized
labels elsewhere.  Both he and I wanted the number to be as large as possible,
and I also was hoping to shift a few bodies out of Phoenix if I could find any
who preferred Alabama to Arizona.

<p>

It was not only a real solution to a foolish but pressing problem, but the
upheavals that such an idea would normally produce were avoidable.  Years
later, when the horrid Computer Sciences Corporation wrested the contract away
from GE, there were mass defections and huge losses of efficiency.  But the
Hoelzer/von Braun/Grosch plan intended only those who were happy with the
switch, to shift to General Electric.  Those who preferred Uncle Sam would
keep on doing what they were doing, and their old friends at adjacent desks
would just change hats.

<p>

Moreover, it was a very well run shop.  I didn't have to send in a wrecking
crew, or ingenious repairmen, or a great many new people.  There would have
been no reason at all for Wernher to play such a game, and spend a lot of
extra money, if the Civil Service had had its head screwed on straight.  While
I was putting away my tapemeasure I was looking for potential GE managers
among the Huntsvillers, and even that didn't look too difficult, in a
successful operation.  In disaster areas, as many latterday facilities
management situations turned out to be, finding good supervisory people is
tough.  It would be quite possible at Huntsville.

<p>

I went back to Arizona and set to work.  I had the jump on other potential
bidders - and fairly, since I had been in at the conception.  When the request
came out, it did not even hint at the slot problem, and some of the less
appreciated contenders never found out.  IBM did, of course, and was in the
long run the only other bidder that a substantial number of the better ABMA
youngsters would have considered working for.  The state universities knew,
but were not attractive in that context.  The aerospace companies already on
the ground in Huntsville knew; the carpetbaggers flying in from L.A. did not.

<p>
<a name="[-225-]"><font color="red">[-225-]</font></a>

Wernher and Helmut ended up with thirteen bids, of which IBM was highest and
not very explicit ("trust us!"), I was next high, and the others trailed off
to obvious buy-ins and total misses.

<p>

My document said, tongue in cheek, that there was, ahem, just one hitch,
"Because of the urgency of establishing the new operational method, General
Electric would like permission to hire a number of civil service and
other-contractor personnel while appropriate recruiting is under way." No
limit on that number was specified, needless to say.

<p>

Just a few days before Sputnik went up, we were notified we had been chosen.
By coincidence, Strickland had already called a divisional management meeting
at Camelback Inn for the next weekend, and a very senior internal consultant,
Dick Porter, who had succeeded me several terms later as Rocket Society
president and who knew von Braun much better than I did, was to attend.  He
had managed the Bumper shots at White Sands, when his General Electric crew
put upper stages on some reassembled V-2 rockets as the climax of Wernher's
efforts out there.  He was to comment, presumably unfavorably, on Huntsville
and on my attempts to get in bed with the von Braun team.

<p>

This would have been undercut by my success in any event - counting quite a
bit of 704 time I intended to sell to Hoelzer, the first year was scheduled at
$800,000 and looked very good to us impoverished Arizonans.  But Porter came
red hot from an International Geophysical Year meeting in Washington the night
before [Friday 4 October], at which the Russian attendees announced the
successful launching of Sputnik I.  Fantastic!

<p>

Porter was devastated; he was deeply involved in the U.S. effort, and somewhat
on the Navy side.  I was enormously excited as a spacenik, as an old ARS
president, and because it was clear that von Braun would have to ride to the
rescue of the American space effort with his big Jupiters: Baron von
Lochinvar, forsooth!

<p>

Phoenix was in an uproar next week, as were most cities with any kind of link
to aerospace or advanced technology.  My efforts to publicize the computer at
Arizona State and, more broadly, the GE presence in Arizona put me high on the
media shopping lists, and I gave half a dozen interviews, much to Elizabeth's
gratification and Barney Oldfield's disgust.  I said the Computer Department
expected to conclude a contract with ABMA, the people who were likely to
launch the first U.S. satellite, and if so would be furnishing computing
services and people to assist that effort.  This was imbedded in interviews
about satellite orbits, Russian science, rocketry - and education.

<p>

The major point I made was that we needed to greatly improve the quality of
high school and even grade school teaching in the United States, and certainly
in Phoenix: more math, more science, more English, and less baton-twirling and
mental junk-food.  It would never have made the papers or the interview
programs without Sputnik; I had tried milder versions in describing the
computer "revolution" and gotten nowhere.  It was the first such call in
Arizona, and was quickly taken up by a dozen voices in Phoenix, Tempe and
Tucson.

<p>

One reason I had publicly described the Huntsville arrangement was that
internal sabotage was a clear possibility.  Oldfield had had the temerity to
say
<a name="[-226-]"><font color="red">[-226-]</font></a>
at the closing dinner of the divisional meeting on the Sunday that his
department was not interested in facility management or in selling services.
I had said afterwards to Strickland that if he wanted me to, I would transfer
the incipient contract to one of the departments of the Military Electronics
Division - and as expected, he had bristled at the very thought (and at losing
all that fine money)!  Still, there were a dozen ways Barney could trip me up.
Community expectations were good insurance, and publicized enthusiasm on the
part of the Valley Bank officers and Good Old Grady was useful.  I sent
clippings of their press interviews, and my own of course, off to Strickland
and LaPierre back East, naturally marking Oldfield for copies.

<p>

My own troops were delighted, and to my surprise I had several good volunteers
for a well-cushioned transfer to the Huntsville operation.  I put Asmus and
Benson on the nasty Phoenix/Memphis air trip to get things started (I seem to
remember DC-4s), and went to work ardently on the contract itself.  Fueled by
Barney's announced distaste for the project, the sales and finance people kept
scooting off in weird directions, but they were too hungry for the money to
completely refuse help.  Things moved ahead.

<p>

I had decided to offer the Huntsville Operation management to a bright young
German named Helmuth Sassenfeld.  He was not one of the Peenemunde tribe, and
hence was not completely bound to Wernher's wheel, but he had been a Watson
Lab fellow [!!] and was a valued member of the ABMA crew.  He had a good
doctorate, which along with the language made him stand high with von Braun
And Co.  Also he was married to a handsome Alabama blonde, who was producing
offspring at a rate which would soon outstrip ABMA salaries!  He was already
providing useful intelligence.

<p>

One day he called me, from his home of course, and warned me that competitors,
led by Computer Sciences people already working at Redstone, were going to try
to take away "my" 704 time sales.  They would underbid the rate, or point to
existing data links back to California - we had to install one, of course, and
the local phone company was lethargic.  "But Helmuth," I said, "Dr. von Braun
has understood from the beginning that we need that money to make the deal
look good to the parent General Electric management."  "Yes, I know," said
Sassenfeld, "but these people have lines in to General Medaris, who doesn't
think much of the GE thing anyhow, and likes to be spiteful to us [the
Germans] on little things."

<p>

I called a chap names Rees, a senior PAPERCLIPper, who was Wernher's top
administrator, and asked him to set up an appointment for me with General
Medaris "to discuss the General Electric facility management contract," and
told him to warn his boss privately that I was going to "make waves" - a new
Americanism for him.  I flew to Huntsville.

<p>

Medaris was not "the very model of a modern major general," but a real
stinker.  He had his big desk and throne-like chair set up on a dais, and
there were no seats below.  I put my hands conspicuously in my pockets and
leaned into my act.  "General, ABMA is going to have a problem.  The civilian
personnel at your computer installation are excited about getting out from
under Civil Service restrictions on salary and expense accounts and such, and
I have been encouraging them because it would have made the transition to the
facility management milieu easier.  I'm afraid that when word gets out that GE
<a name="[-227-]"><font color="red">[-227-]</font></a>
isn't coming, there will be mass defections.  Most of the Germans will stay,
of course, but the market for regular computer people is so good, especially
in California aircraft and missile activities, that you will probably lose
quite a few.  In fact, I will alert my own personnel people in Phoenix, so
that we can pick off some of the best ones ourselves as they go by."

<p>

Medaris reared up.  "What do you mean, General Electric isn't coming?  Of
course you are coming!  You have a contract..."

<p>

"General Medaris, we have not signed a contract.  You can easily verify that
my boss, the manager of the Phoenix department, does not want to do so.  It is
only my private assurances to him and to the division vice president about the
promised arrangement to sell you surplus computer capacity while more ABMA
machines are on order, that have kept the arrangement alive.  Your financial
people are double-crossing me.  So I have stopped pushing, and the deal will
die.  No doubt other bidders like, ah, Computer Sciences will be glad to take
over, although that will take a while.  I'm sorry this came up just when your
opportunity to launch Explorer with your Army missile is so attractive, but no
doubt Dr. von Braun will overcome this new handicap."

<p>

Some fairly vigorous shouting ensued.  Rees adopted a suitably lugubrious air
and confirmed that the current load in Dr. Hoelzer's laboratory was very, very
heavy.  Dislocations would set back some of the satellite project calculations
quite seriously.  Medaris looked daggers at me - he had not risen to senior
officership without learning to listen between the lines.  He said I should
put the contract matter on hold until he could discuss the time-and-materials
buy with the procurement division.  I said I would do so, but that even word
of that hold was likely to cause problems, so fast action was indicated.  More
glares from the dais.  I strutted out.

<p>

Wernher called me privately.  "Rees said you grabbed him by the whiskers,
Herb, instead of the other way around!  I would like to have seen it."
"Well," I said, "I hope I haven't kicked over the Explorer bucket.  I want you
to get upstairs; I want to be on the team.  But I won't be shafted by the good
general or by CSC."  Not to worry, said the amused Maximum Leader.

<p>

The very next day a grumpy Alabaman called me at home after working hours and
said that the requisition for 704 time had been signed, and that Dr. Hoelzer
would begin drawing down on it immediately.  He said nothing about the
facility contract.  Neither did I.

<p>

The rest of the Huntsville story is routine, except to note that the von Braun
team did indeed launch Explorer the next January, considerably after Sputnik
II and the dog "Laika", but six weeks ahead of the Navy's Vanguard.  I saw it
orbiting overhead from my marvelously dark cactus garden outside Scottsdale,
and rejoiced.

<p>

The contract was renewed for several years, long into the NASA era.  Before
von Braun got very far into the Saturn program, however, General Electric
moved the work to another department, and soon lost the job to Computer
Sciences, which was still lurking in the bushes.  It was one of my firsts, and
a foundation stone under the GE Information Services operations which are all
that remain today of the foredoomed General Electric effort.

<p>

As a coda, another story about Wernher.  When I was well into my second IBM
hitch, in the fall of 1958, I spent a good deal of time hanging around the
<a name="[-228-]"><font color="red">[-228-]</font></a>
Military Products Division, later euphemized as Federal Systems.  One day the
general manager, Charlie Benton, who had heard my Huntsville stories ad
nauseum, challenged me.  He wanted von Braun to look at the superconductivity
work going on in Benton's Kingston shops, and had found out that Glamorous
Wernher was giving a popular lecture at the IBM Country Club in Poughkeepsie
(for a fat fee, needless to say).  "See if you can work on him to come over to
Kingston, Grosch," he said.

<p>

I knew something about the corporate airplane (IBM then had only one, a
Convair).  I put a tentative hold on it for the appropriate dates.  Then I
called Hoelzer.  "Helmut, old buddy," I said, "I want to do you and Wernher a
big favor.  But I need something in return." And I described my plan.

<p>

"You should to talk to his aide," said Hoelzer.  "He's just a kid, but you can
be free with him, while the boss is a little hard to get to these days."  I
could imagine!  So I called the aide and said, "I have picked up the word here
at IBM Headquarters that my old friend Dr. von Braun is to speak to an
audience in Poughkeepsie next month.  Mr. Watson - who unfortunately as you
know is going to be in Europe that week - and our other executives would like
to be welcoming.  How about having a family party, since the affair is not
business anyhow?  Wernher and the baroness, and you and your wife, and Helmut
Hoelzer and Cristel, and maybe one or two other couples, can come up on the
company plane, which is very comfortable.  The autumn foliage will be at its
peak here, and our Kenyon Estate guest house is much nicer than the local
hotel.  We'll organize something for the ladies; my wife wants to help."

<p>

"But lieutenant, my boss wants to show the good doctor some of our advanced
research - some new stuff on superconductive computer memory that will be
important for big space station computers ten or twenty years from now.  While
the ladies are touring West Point Saturday morning, or whatever, we'll take a
limo over to the Kingston plant, see the demonstration, and return for lunch
or to catch the plane back to Huntsville."

<p>

"I'll check with Dr. von Braun and get back to you, sir," the aide said.  Soon
he accepted for everybody, and I tied up the plane, notified the lectureship
people, and set the well-greased IBM wheels in motion.  Time passed, as it
eventually does even in Poughkeepsie.

<p>

Just before the great day, the aide came on the phone.  "Doctor, one of the
von Braun children is running a temperature, so the baroness does not want
to come up to New York.  Dr. von Braun says that you should send the plane a
little later, just for him, and plan to fly him back that night after the
lecture."

<p>

 style="margin-right:12"></a>

"Young man," said I, "you tell Wernher for me: no visit to Kingston, no plane!
He can fly commercial.  The lecture people will meet him at LaGuardia, of
course, and arrange to put him up at the local hotel."  "Jesus - I can't say
that to Dr. von Braun, sir!"  "Start by saying that Dr. Grosch seemed, ah, a
little upset.  If that doesn't work, try mentioning General Medaris."

<p>

All the men came.  The ladies, poor victims, got left in Alabama with the
baroness.  Wernher charmed everybody half silly - he was at the very peak of
his physical attractiveness.  The lecture was dull; no matter.  The audience
stood to applaud.  We adjourned to the guest house.

<p>

"Herb, for God's sake get me a drink!"  "Wernher, this is IBM.  How about a
malted milk??" Great scene!  He settled for ginger ale.

<p>

He couldn't have been nicer.  Kingston was a big success.  The engineers and
scientists got to touch their hero - and he really was, to many of them.
Charlie Benton was happy.  My wife Elizabeth was absolutely gaga.  We put him
and his troupe on the plane around three o'clock.  I never saw him close up
<a name="[-229-]"><font color="red">[-229-]</font></a>
again.

<p>

I think I understood him.  He wanted to go to Mars.  Not into orbit, not just
to the Moon, not via robot vision.  He, he himself, in an Arthur Clarke space
suit - he wanted to go to Mars.  I hope his ashes make it.

The von Braun venture didn't really improve things much for the Computer
Department.  It got my troops off the hook; no one had to be laid off,
McCracken could finish his second book, Benson had real work flowing in from
Huntsville to keep his 704 busy.  But the central tasks of the new department
were not affected.  In Palo Alto, Bob Johnson still had to finalize the system
design for the Bank of America, and the detailed design of the central
computer.  Joe Weizenbaum, who had clearly won the battle with my section to
do the software for the machine (now christened ERMA), had to write and check
out the key programs.  My guys offered to help and were turned away.  In fact,
as I remember it, we were never able to get an instruction set or timings, so
Dan could not even offer free samples.

<p>

While Johnson was ferociously busy, the Official Engineers next door to me in
the Arizona State building were trying to find something profitable to do.
For a while there was talk at Oldfield's staff meetings of putting out a line
of analog components, in competition with a tiny firm back East called
Philbrick Associates.  I kept reminding the uneasy group that Baker - and now
Strickland - wanted us to put IBM out of business, not overwhelm a fifty-man
shop nobody in the IBM universe had ever heard of.  Lasher, reluctant to admit
that the analog section of his secret study the year before had been beefed up
to get Schenectady support for creating the new department, admitted the
analog market was dwindling.

<p>

Then a strange portent appeared: National Cash Register.  They knew more about
us than most of the other established firms in the arena because they had
turned down the bank contract, and had watched to see who got suckered into
it.

<p>

To explain how they were involved I have to backspace a little.  The group
from Northrop who had faced down John McPherson and forced IBM to bring out
the original CPC did not disband, or turn back to using the Model Is and
<a name="[-232-]"><font color="red">[-232-]</font></a>
Model IIs as they became available.  Instead they added new partisans and
moved into computer design.  Northrop had ample Korean War funds; for a year
or two the little cabal stayed hidden among the computer users.

<p>

They came out with a curious machine called MADDIDA: Magnetic Drum Digital
Differential Analyzer, as I remember; it was in a sense a digital simulation
of an electronic differential analyzer like the ones the Phoenix General
Electric engineers wanted to build.  The group, now led by a chap named Floyd
Steele, split off from Northrop and became CRC, Computer Research Corporation,
with a small facility in Hawthorne, California.

<p>

They sold a fair number of machines, enough to keep afloat, but the great
speeds of the 701s and 1103s confirmed what I had been saying in my speeches
from 1949 on, and in my internal grumblings about the jet engine simulator GE
was building for Wright Field: most analog applications were going to be
digitized.  The MADDIDA was a compromise; it was digital, and it appealed to
many engineers.  But it was not general purpose; you couldn't just switch
programs and run payroll.  It was really an unusual (and powerful) way to
solve differential equations - and there were precious few of those in banks,
or department stores.

<p>

While CRC was making and selling its original machine, therefore, a design
team was laying out a general purpose small mainframe, a little smaller than
the IBM 650.  The prototype didn't work very well.  The money was running out.

<p>

Back in the boondocks, sleepy National Cash was finally realizing it needed to
sell computers, and as soon as possible to design and build them as well.  The
company was great at turning out brass cash registers, but the soaring years
of Patterson, who had built the outfit and trained Watson Senior, were decades
behind.  NCR had slowly made the transition to electrical and even electronic
operation, but was about where Remington Rand had been when Eckert and Mauchly
clambered aboard.  A somewhat similar way for NCR to take the giant leap was
to acquire an advanced computer outfit; they bought CRC.

<p>

The Dayton electronics people tried to salvage the Hawthorne prototype,
leaving Steele And Co. to do weirder and more wonderful things.  I no longer
remember the level of redesign, but certainly the specifications, which had
been leaked to a few favorite customers, were not changed.  They went to
better components, redid the packaging for simpler maintenance - that sort of
thing.  The new prototype didn't work either.

<p>

First I heard of it was when Lasher and Oldfield asked me to pretty up the
computer center for important visitors.  There wasn't much else for them to
show off; the Official Engineers had only desks and drawing boards, the
administration was in rented space in a downtown TV station building, and Bob
Johnson's shop was miles away and somewhat off limits (at Al Zipf's request).
The visitors turned out to be the top men at NCR, headed by a courtly
gentleman named Allyn, who obviously didn't know a transistor from a toggle
switch, but found my 704 most impressive.  We were careful not to stress that
it was an IBM machine.

<p>

There was a major meeting.  I listened with my eyes rolling in my head, as I
realized GE was offering to redesign the poor brute of a machine one more
time, and manufacture it in fair quantities for National Cash to sell and
service
<a name="[-232-]"><font color="red">[-232-]</font></a>
(it was to be called the NCR 314).  Our department was indeed planning
a manufacturing facility north of Phoenix, and it would be making ERMA
computers and testing them in complete banking systems in a year or two.  So
that part was possible, although it seemed to me Dayton could probably do it
as well as we could, and would have much deeper support facilities.  But who
would do the redesign?  And, my part of the discussion, who would do the
systems programming?  The NCR crew didn't seem to know what I meant, and I
wasn't all that sure the Tempe boys did either.

<p>

Dan McCracken and I realized this was one project that would have to fly or
flounder in Phoenix; Palo Alto was fully engaged.  We literally begged for a
chance to help, and I made sure that the NCR people heard me begging.  Dan
took the order code of the 314 home one long weekend and brought back a 704
simulation - one of the most remarkable feats of forced-draft programming I
ever witnessed.  We tried to add timings and input/output stuff as well; even
today that is not easy, and this was 1957.  And we hung around the edges of
the circus, offering to carry water for the elephants and feed the tigers,
even if we couldn't do our trapeze act.  Not a chance!

<p>

Dan gave up.  He was anxious to try the deeper management waters in GE.  He
took the Cordiner/Smiddy philosophy more seriously, and the Gerry Neumann
counterexample less seriously, than I did.  He wangled a staff job in
operations research back at 570 Lexington, bade us a sad farewell, and
decamped.  Charlie Asmus and I felt just as badly about Oldfield and
Strickland and the poor dumb department as Dan, but Chaz was pretty deeply
committed to a General Electric career, and I was watching Elizabeth revel in
the Phoenix climate and Phoenix society - and enjoying the non-GE part of it
myself.

<p>

Elizabeth and Grace and Deo and I had first lived "in irrigation" on the north
side of Phoenix, and I would drive across open desert in the morning with the
top down on the 190SL, to the welcome air conditioning of the computer center
in Tempe.  We had installed an air conditioner in Elizabeth's Chevrolet, so
she and her aunt and the poodle had gentler transport.  We wanted a much more
elegant house, and in the desert; we were being entertained a great deal, and
looked forward to reciprocating.

<p>

We had been taken up swiftly by the local power structure.  It was partly that
Barney had family problems, and could not accept many of the social
opportunities that came his way; he did the Downtown Luncheon Club thing
nicely, but that was about it.  Public image counted for a lot in Arizona, and
I was an old hand at working the media, having four years of Cincinnati 701<br>
and 704 publicity behind me, and the Rocket Society.  And Grady and Kay
Gammage genuinely liked us, and spread the story of our romantic courtship and
marriage and honeymoon around town.  Elizabeth was much taken with a
smoky-eyed socialite named Kax Herberger, who promptly made her chairman of a
Symphony Guild committee and inserted her into the afternoon-tea circuit.

<p>

Then there were our friends the Haases.  Lew was into everything, as an early
settler, the director of the Chamber of Commerce, and one of the Hondo-Wearing
Boys who thought they ran that part of the state.  Actually it was run by the
Valley Bank, the power company, and two or three
<a name="[-234-]"><font color="red">[-234-]</font></a>
very rich landowners (one of
whom sold GE its factory site in Black Canyon), but they kept a loose rein.
Elizabeth and I spent many happy hours at the Haas place I had so admired on
my very first visit.

<p>

Elizabeth Haas told us it was more than they needed now that their children
were gone.  Would we be interested in buying it?  We were delighted, and it
was easy to deal with friends, without agents and lawyers and all that.  They
helped us with the loan: "New people like yourselves are always welcome here,"
said the banker, "especially friends of the Gammages and the Haases."

<p>

Well, the air conditioning didn't work in the pretty guest house, which was to
be Aunt Grace's.  And the main house was riddled with termites.  And Lew did
caveat emptor on us, and I found no lawyer in town would sue their old buddy.
Scratch, oh, five thousand dollars - and one major and several minor
friendships.  We were both anxious to have the house, and it was just right
for us.  But Elizabeth had sold real estate back in Ohio, and I had watched my
GE buddy pay twice for his swimming pool...

<p>

We had learned the hard way that newcomers to Arizona always got fleeced at
least once.  It was a major industry, second only (and related) to tourism.
If you survived, you were then entitled to duck behind a saguaro and take the
next greenhorn yourself.  I imagine it is much the same today.  You can be
cute and talk about the pioneer spirit, or you can be grateful you're not an
Indian.

<p>

I confined my raiding to the computer business, and was considerably more
successful than in real estate.  I had heard of a strange establishment down
below Tucson, on the Mexican border.  It had always been called Fort Huachuca,
but now was touted as the Army's electronic proving ground.  The idea was that
you could cruise around in a tank or an armored carrier, perhaps with light
aircraft or helicopters overhead, and play games with radio communications and
small radars and whatever.  Back at Aberdeen they might test a tank for its
climbing ability, but there was no room for wide-ranging electronics - and a
lot of interference, and taxpayers with tender televisions.

<p>

Not long after the story of the 704 began to hit the Arizona papers, I got a
call from a Dr. Frederick B.  Thompson in Tucson.  He said he and a small
group of technical people were working on a contract at Huachuca, and had been
given space at the University in order to have access to a computer and
libraries.  Could he and his Number Two come up and see me?

<p>

This was at a time when I was very anxious to sell some 704 time.  And
besides, I was aware of the intense rivalry between Arizona State and the
University; emissaries from the Tucson camp were of great interest.  Well, it
turned out Freddie and I had many mutual friends, mostly at Rand.  He had been
the central figure there in the Superstraw air warfare simulation, which had
begun shortly after I left Forrester, and which had given Stan Rothman many of
his ideas.  It was a lively conversation.

<p>

Fred and his sidekick, Mike Seven, were employed by a consulting outfit in Los
Angeles which had the contract with the Army.  The work was going badly, and I
quickly understood why.  To write simulations, or software of any sort, you
have to have a clear and stable statement of the problem.  When my women in
Evendale sat down with a familiar engineer (I use the term with
<a name="[-235-]"><font color="red">[-235-]</font></a>
some trepidation), the big job was to extract that clear statement and keep it
unchanged or under close control while the coding and debugging and running of
the program took place.  The Huachucans really didn't know what they wanted,
and the Thompson team was reluctant to force a solution to an unwanted problem
on them.

<p>

"Well," I said, "could we do better, or could you do better if you worked for
GE?"  "Not technically," said Mike, "but with a cushion of other work under
us, we could afford to beat on them for answers.  Right now, we're under the
gun."  Fred chimed in, "Don't think for a minute this particular model is the
only task down there.  If we had the freedom to look, we could turn up a dozen
major computing and modelling jobs."

<p>

I wasn't sanguine.  From the brief descriptions, I could guess that the other
jobs would also suffer from inept customering.  But the group - there were two
juniors and a secretary in Tucson - looked great.  I had left my best analysts
back in Ohio, and the new ones Benson had recruited in Lynn and brought along
were still untested.  Parenthetically, the team of Charles and Harriet Meadow
turned out wonderfully in the next year - but so did the Thompsonites.

<p>

I hired them.  They had houses in Tucson, so for a start I left them there,
thus establishing an outpost in U. of A. territory.  This involved an
opportunity to meet the president of the university, who attempted to pass me
down to the head of their tiny computer operation.  I wiggled out of that, and
became friendly with the academic vice president.  He and his wife had a
lovely house north of Tucson - the desert was higher than around Phoenix - and
I especially remember a terrific white male toy poodle named Florio, the first
toy I had ever really admired.  Thompson was allowed to stay on, but there
were tensions; the president had been partial to the Los Angeles firm, and
regarded the beam I had inserted in that eye as at least a mote in his own.
In the end I let Fred move to commercial space nearby.

<p>

All this was before the von Braun romance, and things got much worse in the
department - and not just for my section - as time ground on.  The Bank of
America effort went fairly well, and the Tempe engineers got to work on the
NCR 314, but there was no long range plan, and with the exception of Johnson
and two or three others in Palo Alto, no obvious competence.  Although GE had
spent only a few million bucks so far, and that mostly on the MICR rights, the
trifurcation of Doc Baker's old empire made the new divisional vice presidents
anxious to show profits or at least cut losses.

<p>

Our guy Strickland had a harder row to hoe than his military counterpart, and
knew nothing about computer technology, or even its impoverished history in
Syracuse and Schenectady.  My attempts to tell him how great Generous Electric
was as a computer user were easily undercut by Oldfield, who claimed they were
at best self-aggrandizing, and probably not even true.  It never seemed to
occur to Barney that making some of his people look good, made him look good -
a lesson I had willingly learned from Maxwell and Curtis in the Thirties.  And
I was obviously contemptuous of the whole Arizona operation, although not
outside the walls of the department.

<p>

One day when I was scouting in Huntsville, getting ready to make my proposal
to Hoelzer and von Braun, I got an urgent call from my secretary.

<p>
<a name="[-236-]"><font color="red">[-236-]</font></a>

"There is a big division visit set for tomorrow in Oldfield's office," Jean
said, "and I just got the word a few minutes ago; they say it was an
oversight.  Charlie is in New York, so I thought I should call you."  She had
Charlie's secretary working on the air reservations, and actually relayed them
to me before she hung up.  I reluctantly climbed on the nasty flight to
Memphis, sat up three hours in the middle of the night waiting for the
connection to Phoenix, and arrived green from airsickness (it had been very
rough into Douglas) at about the time Strickland's meeting was to start.

<p>

Jean met me at the airport, having told Elizabeth she needed to brief me on
developments, and drove me to department headquarters.  Oldfield looked
daggers at me as I staggered in, probably because he had hoped for my absence.
Strickland was holding forth on the relative merits of binary and decimal
representation, about which he knew rather less than Jean Miller.  I mopped my
brow and wished I had another barf bag.

<p>

Soon I recovered enough to start objecting.  Strickland turned sharply on me
and said, "Herb, you just got here."  "Harold," I snarled, "you're the one who
just got here.  I've been here for twenty years."  Ah me, how to win friends
and influence vice presidents!  He never forgave me.

<p>

There was a hiring freeze, but it was too late to catch the Applications
Section; I was at full strength.  And of course the freeze had to be set aside
as soon as the Huntsville contract was firm.  I was not popular at Barney's
meetings.

<p>

When the Huntsville operation was solidly underway, with Sassenfeld aboard as
a subsection manager and the transfers of Phoenix people to the new operation
safely begun, I talked seriously to Elizabeth.  She had been very supportive
as I struggled with Barney and his henchmen, although she must have remembered
all the great stories I had told her in Wauseon and New York about Wonderful
GE.  "I love the desert," she said, "and so does Grace and the little boy
[Deo].  But you do what you have to do.  I hate to see you knuckle under to
those stupid people."

<p>

I went to New York and talked to Jim LaPierre, who was by this time executive
vice president.  He was as friendly as ever, but told me bluntly that his job
for the next year or two was to settle the turmoil inside and outside GE
caused by the prosecution and imprisonment [!] of a gaggle of high company
officers who had been caught conspiring with their opposite numbers in other
companies to fix prices and split up lucrative contracts.  It was a seven days
wonder in the U.S. business community, and a severe strain on the
professional-management philosophy of Cordiner And Co.

<p>

"It's up to the group executive and the division executive to direct the
company's entry into computers, Herb.  I'm sure they are doing their best."
"Their best is nowhere near good enough, Jim - not with IBM snapping at their
heels," I replied.  "Even if they had a Neumann or a Parker, it would be
tough; IBM is more dominant in its business than your old friend P&amp;W.  I hate
to give up.  The company has enormous resources.  With the right leadership it
could give IBM a good run.  Gossip in the trade has it that Tom Watson
[Junior] regards GE as a major threat, much more serious than Rem Rand."

<p>

"Could you do better than Oldfield?" he asked.  "Anybody could do better than
Barney," I said.  "That technique of pitting his managers against one
<a name="[-237-]"><font color="red">[-237-]</font></a>
another is a killer."  "There was a lot of that in Syracuse, Herb."  "But
Harold wouldn't let me near the controls; he doesn't even encourage me to get
more Huntsville-type contracts, Jim."

<p>

He couldn't have been nicer.  But the potential damage to General Electric of
the anti-trust schemozzle was literally in the hundreds of millions; it
consumed him.  In later years I was reminded again and again of the Norris
Aphorism.  GE had too many things on its plate: jet engines, and atomic power,
and gigantic legal problems - not to mention the consumer businesses, and the
industrial businesses, and the military and space businesses, and the
financial and service businesses - to do justice to its puny little computer
entry.

<p>

LaPierre sent me down to talk to Harold Smiddy, who was in many respects the
most powerful of the General Electric staff officers - perhaps it is not too
unkind to compare him to the chief party theoretician versus more ordinary
Politburo types, in 1957 Moscow.  He was brilliant; in his heyday perhaps the
best known business philosopher in the country, excepting only Peter Drucker
(whom he frequently employed).  I had watched him in action on Association
Island two years before, under the famous elm tree.  It gives you a feel for
the man to know what he said there: that if two or three of the hundred or so
GE departments were not in trouble at any given time, company policy was too
conservative.

<p>

That may well be the idea in the giant IBM of today, but it certainly was
light years away from The Old Man's philosophy in the Forties and before: Not
A Sparrow Falls, or in another context (viz. the prune episode), Win `Em All.
You could be having trouble in the GE X-Ray Department and not hurt the
Dishwasher Department at all; the Watsonian Empire was regarded as
indivisible.

<p>

Smiddy knew me by reputation - had in fact toured the old 701 shop in Building
300.  He was unimpressed with my story about Phoenix.  "Too soon to tell
anything," he pointed out.  "You haven't even finished the first machine for
the bank.  And it often takes several managers to get a new show on the road;
Oldfield may not be there forever.  Do your job well and you may outlive him."
"He will be replaced with someone chosen by Strickland," I said, "and Harold
doesn't know beans about IBM or the computer business - not even as much as
Doc Baker - and doesn't look to be learning very fast."  Smiddy was clearly
losing patience; he didn't often deal with lowly section managers, even
notorious ones.

<p>

"I'd like to point you in another direction, Harold," I said.  "In a few years
everybody will see, as you have already seen, that information flows are what
tie together a giant diversified company like GE.  Separate departments and
their primary functions are sort of linked by standard accounting practices
even today, or you couldn't compare results or put out the annual report.
Soon the various business and technical computers will talk to each other, and
you can have what we call a real-time picture of the company's operations."

<p>

"I suggest you may want to start up a staff function on information processing
- not just computers, but also the communications and other auxiliaries.
Right now it would pay off in more sophisticated procurements, and by helping
advanced departments like the AGT ones help
<a name="[-238-]"><font color="red">[-238-]</font></a>
those just starting to use
computers."  Harold bristled visibly.  "Grosch," he said, "I'm having enough
trouble keeping the damned accountants from stitching the company back
together again, without you pushing everybody's computers into cooperating."

<p>

Well, there went the ball game.  Twenty years later GE, now out in fashionable
Connecticut rather than in that Lexington Avenue tower I had hoped to fill
with computers and programmers, initiated exactly such a function.  I had been
a little previous - or maybe the company had to wait for Harold Smiddy and his
philosophies to be forgotten.

<p>

I had had a great run.  I was convinced that the company which had been so
good to me would not succeed in the field I loved - even after the hitch in
Phoenix I supposed I could switch back to AGT and work for Cochran again, or
Gerry, but I didn't want to.  It was time to go - and unlike McCracken, to go
all the way - out of GE.  I was sorry.

<p>

After the dedication of my building in Evendale, I had lost Liston Tatum.  I
forget now whether he left IBM then, or later; at least he had to leave Ohio.
He had been just what I needed, and a friend besides - and the hero of The
Oklahoma Land Rush.

<p>

IBM sent me a good replacement named Bob Maxwell, a little more of a salesman
than Liston, but still a capable link back to the Poughkeepsie and Endicott
shops, and to Applied Science.  He came to me quietly when word first began to
get around that I was going to throw in with the new GE computer initiative.
"Herb," he said, "I have been asked to tell you that we would like to have you
back in IBM.  There are things going on that you would be delighted with, some
of them things you helped start.  You could give us all kinds of guidance, and
we know a lot more about how to use your kind of skills than we did when you
left."  And he claimed IBM would have asked me before, except for reluctance
"at every level" to steal me away from a customer.

<p>

I had been flattered.  If what he said was literally true, it was a
considerable compliment; someone had had to back 'way down on my
unacceptability, or someone else had to have been mightily impressed with my
Evendale accomplishments.  On the other hand, if they were saying they wanted
me not to go to Phoenix because I would be too formidable a worker in the new
GE vineyard, that was also a compliment - of a dubious sort, but still a
compliment.

<p>

"Would you pass the word back to 590, Bob," I said after a little thought,
"that I'm flattered by the offer, and would take it in a minute except that
I've gone too far with the big shots who are starting the new GE activity.  I
loved being in IBM, and I was still hanging on to the door frame in Washington
with both hands while Cuthbert and his crew were shoving me out.  I wanted to
stay, and I'd like to get back.  Maybe down the road it'll be possible."

<p>

After I got done with Smiddy I had gone back up to LaPierre's suite to say
goodbye and thank you.  I was startled to meet Lou Rader, who was general
manager of another of Strickland's departments, and who was on the same rather
sad mission.  He could not stand Strickland, just as I could not stand
Oldfield, and in spite of his higher rank and longer service than mine, had
also decided to leave General Electric.  After a little sparring we discovered
each
<a name="[-239-]"><font color="red">[-239-]</font></a>
other's secret, and commiserated with poor old GE for losing two such
great guys.  Some years later Lou became the top man in Univac, then went back
to GE - I think to be in Virginia, which he loved dearly - and finally
rejoined the professoriate, in Charlottesville.

<p>

I flew back to the desert and told Elizabeth I had no more hope.  She calmed
me down in her usual fashion, and after I recovered - the excitement had
amplified her powers - I wrote out a little scenario and called Galactic
Headquarters.  I got Horace Post, who was still Tom Junior's private
secretary, and told him I would like to see his boss.  I rehearsed the scene
with Bob Maxwell eighteen months before, suppressing my doubts about IBM's
motives at the time.  "Mr. Watson is out of town this week, Dr.  Grosch," he
said in his quiet way, "but he could see you next Tuesday afternoon."  "I will
be at the Gotham, Horace - and thank you."

<p>

A year or two later, when I was licking my wounds after being savaged by Vin
Learson, I realized I had made a mistake.  I should have run down Bob Maxwell,
or any one of a dozen good friends inside IBM, and found out how the 1957
Evendale invitation had originated.  By going to Tom and recalling the earlier
offer, I had laid an obligation on him: IBM had made some sort of commitment.

<p>

That wasn't at all what I had in mind.  I thought of him as a friend who knew
my history in the Watson Lab and Washington era, who had seen me under full
sail in General Electric, and who because he was top dog in IBM would be best
able to place me or turn me away.  He was serious when I saw him, but asked me
about my new marriage and about Phoenix.  He seemed to have heard about the
Huntsville operation, and was interested in my estimates of American space
enterprises.  The conversation lagged.

<p>

He looked me in the eye.  "Herb, have you changed?" he said.  "They tell me
you could be very useful to the company, but I'm not sure you really will be
happy with us."

<p>

"I'd like to come back to IBM if you still want me," I said.  "I'd prefer to
try something new - not to be too close to Applied Science or the Service
Bureau people, where there were problems before.  For instance, I have an
unusual set of overseas contacts, and IBM is just beginning to look for
technical sales in Europe.  Perhaps I could be of use in Paris."  One problem
I had was that I knew Elizabeth would never, never, never live in Poughkeepsie
or Endicott.

<p>

"We still prefer to use nationals in World Trade, Herb," he said.  "And while
a 709 is going into the Vend?me office next month, that will be under a
young man named Maisonrouge, whom I think you know.  When Horace told me what
you wanted to talk about, I asked Charlie De Carlo where he thought you might
fit while you got used to the company again, and he said he would like to have
you as his executive assistant for a few months.  He has the programming
group, with many of the men and women you knew at the SSEC and the downstairs
701, and most of the university contacts that Dr. Hurd used to service.  Go
over and see him; he's at 425 Park.  Then let me know what you think."

<p>

I was pleased and not pleased.  I knew Charlie well, and could work easily
with him.  But I was obviously being slotted into place, not offered a choice
of assignments.  And down inside, where I hoped Tom Junior couldn't hear him,
<a name="[-240-]"><font color="red">[-240-]</font></a>
a little green demon was whispering that Charlie was junior to Hurd, and Hurd
was junior to me.  Not in IBM, alas, but in the wide world outside, and
especially among my 704 buddies.

<p>

De Carlo had come out of Pittsburg.  He had a good doctorate in something like
differential geometry - remember, that was years before computer science
departments - and had come directly to work for Cuthbert in 1951, only two
years after Applied Science had started.  He was neither a narrow scientist
like Eckert nor a Hundred Percent Club enthusiast; in fact, what he really
should have been was an opera singer.  Many years later, after our paths no
longer crossed in Computerland, he escaped from IBM with Tom Watson's
assistance, and became president of Sarah Lawrence.  His wife Dorothy played
good cello and didn't think much of the IBM constrictions; the college job was
just exactly right for both of them, and I heard many times how popular they
were, even in the difficult days of the early Seventies.

<p>

We had crossed blades many times.  He was a loyal IBMer, but not painfully so.
He was fun socially, and never developed the quick look over the shoulder that
so many Headquarters executives displayed.  He was as good a judge of wines as
I, and had a considerable capacity for sake martinis.  He liked my Maisonette
Restaurant in Cincinnati.  He was blond, medium height, a little heavy; three
years younger than I.  He came on to strangers half way between cordial and
sharp.

<p>

There turned out to be two floors of IBM offices at 425 Park Avenue.  Charlie
himself was embedded in a sea of programmers, who were working under a chap I
had never met, Jack Ahlin.  They had troubles.  His corner office was
cluttered with their annotated printouts, but Charlie was relaxed.  We got
down to cases.

<p>

He knew I understood the 590 kind of operation.  There were still no
organization charts.  Tom Watson called the shots for everybody, just as his
father had - but it was understood that those days were coming to an end.
Unlike GE, there were lots of special-assignment and assistant-to jobs in
every cranny of every building - and lots of buildings.  I was to do what
Charlie was too busy to do: make speeches, argue with customers (gently),
soothe the programmers.  "Executive assistant" meant I did it all in his name,
not my own.  Some of the tasks were risky.  For instance, IBM had signed the
famous consent decree the year before [1956] agreeing to sell machines as well
as to rent them, and notably to refrain from scaring customers away from the
competition's computers by early disclosure of IBM plans.  Like the 701A dope
The Band Of Brothers beat out of Learson/Hurd/Amdahl, hmmm?  Somehow or other
favored customers still got early word; if an IBMer was caught spreading it he
was in deep trouble.  I remember a mission from the British atomic energy
authority...

<p>

I was really in no hurry.  There were hundreds of places that I could have
tried.  But the lure of IBM was strong, and clearly I was not to be allowed to
bargain, at least about a job.  There was no problem about salary, and when I
told Charlie I had an expensive and very special desert house to dispose of,
he said I could be signed on in Phoenix and transferred "with full benefits."
Not including the art movers, I laughed.  We struck hands.  I went back and
told Horace.  Years later it occurred to me the scenario was not too different
from
<a name="[-241-]"><font color="red">[-241-]</font></a>
the time when Tom gave me twenty four hours to decide whether to go down
to Washington!

<p>

I had done my duty to the troops back at the ranch, but it was a wrench to
leave them nevertheless.  I would have given my right arm - well, a finger or
two, anyhow - to have taken Charlie Asmus and Jean Miller with me; we were a
great team.  But Chaz wanted to stay in GE, and Jean wanted to stay in
Arizona.  I gave notice, having agreed to report to IBM January 1 [1958].  It
would be understating it to say that Barney and his henchmen were delighted.
You could hear them sharpening their knives.  I had alerted Hoelzer and
Sassenfeld in Huntsville, and Grady Gammage at Arizona State, to be ready to
repel boarders, and to help my youngsters do the same.  Asmus and I debated
whether a recommendation from me would help or harm him; in the end I
suggested him as my successor to Oldfield and Strickland "because of the
crucial nature of the new operation in Huntsville, which Charlie helped set
up."  Barney chose Benson.

 style="margin-right:12"></a>


Elizabeth loved the idea of New York.  We never even considered the suburbs.
I found a good apartment in Sutton House, on the corner of 51st Street and
First Avenue: two big bedrooms, the larger with its own bath - very important
for our connubial exercises, which were still frequent and vigorous.  Doormen
around the clock, and a mail room (which came in handy years later when we
moved overseas).  Marion Kellogg, now well on her way to her GE vice
presidency, lived around the corner.  Greta Garbo and Mary Martin lived on our
block, across from the famous River House.  I rooted hard for Elizabeth to see
Garbo, who was her dream actress; every time she did I got hours of dividends.

<p>

D?odat loved it too.  He took to leash walking as if he had been raised in
Manhattan.  We identified neighbors by their dogs: Suzie's Papa (Suzie was a
Skye), Mrs. Dackel (she walked a long-haired dachshund).

<p>

But before I start in on New York I must tell a nice little story about
Arizona: nice, because it came out well.  It epitomizes everything that was
wrong, and a few of the things that were right, about that strange state.

<p>

From our first days in irrigation, we had used a good dry cleaner named Sam
Blue.  Elizabeth and Grace, used to small towns, soon became friendly with the
young driver, who was a nephew of the owner.  About the time we moved to our
desert house the youngster quit delivering our stuff, but Elizabeth assumed it
was because we were on a different route.  She had wanted to hear whether his
teenage wife indeed had produced twins, but the new driver was surly.

<p>

Six months later young Ronnie showed up again with our cleaning.  The girls
were astounded to find out he had been in the juzgado, and not just in the
county one, but in the notorious Florence penitentiary.  He didn't want to
talk about it, but over a few visits they got the story.  The amazing element
for me was that he had been paroled, not because he was near the end of his
sentence, and not particularly for good behavior, and most certainly not
because the twins had indeed arrived - but because the Pen was full, and they
needed space for murderers and worse!  Lesson One: Florence was a hellhole.

<p>

He had been involved with some tough friends, one of whom was the son of a
rich underworld type in Phoenix.  He and the rich kid were caught with a
<a name="[-242-]"><font color="red">[-242-]</font></a>
fair amount of marijuana; the former got off with a warning, Ronnie got two
years.  Lesson Two: a rich father helps, especially if he is known upstairs.

<p>

Elizabeth and Grace were certain Ronnie was a Good Kid, especially after he
brought his pretty wife and the twins over to see us one evening.  One night
not long after that visit, Elizabeth got a frantic call from Mr. Blue.  Ronnie
had been picked up that morning, and was already on his way back to Florence
as a parole violator; the hearing had been in camera and Blue had not even
known, let alone been able to get to a lawyer.  We were the only ones of his
fancier customers who cared about Ronnie and his little family.  Could we
help?  We said we'd try.  Lesson Three: don't count on due process around
Phoenix.

<p>

His lawyer came to see Elizabeth the next afternoon.  I was on my way to New
York - actually, to sign up for the apartment and (miraculously) to finish
selling my dear 190SL to the then occupants as a present for their son at the
University of Utah in Salt Lake.  She poured out the story over the phone:
Ronnie had had a casual meeting with his former friend a week ago, and the day
before the parole officer had snaffled him, said friend had been found out in
the desert, well perforated.  Lesson Four: be careful if you do any off-road
driving in Arizona; there are corpses everywhere.

<p>

Fortunately Ronnie had an iron-clad alibi.  He had been working his cleaning
delivery route all day, and had tickets and customers to prove it; the
execution had been bracketed quite narrowly.  But the cops were angry; they
thought they had a patsy, and could close the case - and the kid was getting
away.  So they had complained to the parole people, and Ronnie had been picked
up and sent back to Florence for seeing the murderee the week before!  Lesson
Five: don't disappoint the cops by being innocent; they'll hate you for it.

<p>

The lawyer said, "There is nothing Mr. Blue can do.  There is really no appeal
procedure; the Parole Board owns the kid body and soul, and could have put him
back for spitting on the sidewalk.  The only thing I think can help is if you
have some connections in the Capitol."  "Herb will fix it," said my glamorous
wife.  Lesson Six: delivery boys should be nice to beautiful customers (it's
easy).

<p>

I talked to Grady and Kay Gammage.  They told me in deepest confidence that
one of the key figures in the governor/assistant/parole and pardons
secretary/director of parole board chain had had a similar minor arrest as a
young man, and might be sympathetic.  I talked to some reporters who had
milked me profitably in the past, and found out how to approach said key
figure.  I talked about von Braun, and the American satellite everybody was
watching.  Soon I found myself in the governor's office, with an uncomfortable
parole board chief across from me.  We talked about how the new General
Electric plant on Black Canyon Highway was progressing.  I mentioned my young
friend Ronnie and his nice little family.  Three days later said young friend
appeared on our doorstep with said family, and we took a picture.  Lesson
Seven: focus carefully at moments of high emotion, or your photo will not be
sharp.

<p>

For the remaining weeks Elizabeth and I avoided lonely roads, and never ever
stopped except in big gas stations and busy parking lots.  The 190SL was
<a name="[-243-]"><font color="red">[-243-]</font></a>
gone, but we assumed the gendarmes had "made" Elizabeth's car.  We escaped to
unruly New York with big sighs of relief.  We had won, but guessed that there
were many unexploded land mines on the battlefield.  Lesson Eight: even
paranoids may really have enemies.

<p>

For three years we got Christmas cards.  The little family was still together.

There were changes in Incredible Business Machines.  It was much larger.  It
was bursting with engineers and scientists.  It was integrating its formerly
rather remote World Trade operations with the domestic efforts - and in
manufacturing and development, not just sales.  Those of us near the
hearthstone of the company understood that professional consultants were in
the woodwork, like the termites in my desert house (and like termites, they
left little piles of debris in unexpected places).

<p>

One thing had not changed.  There was a Watson on the throne, and all
decisions came from the throne room.  I had had the best of two worlds in
Evendale; there was delegation of authority, and clearly defined
responsibility - but also there was real leadership: LaPierre and Parker and
Neumann.  In Phoenix I had seen the failures of professional management
without leadership.  Galactic Headquarters and its outriggers showed how
leadership without professional management operated.  I much preferred it to
Arizona, but Ohio was still better.

<p>

Watson Senior had built up his personal staff over many years, and the load
had not increased any faster than that staff's capacity - or his own.  Watson
Junior had that huge load from the start.  Yes, his father's staff was in
place, and completely loyal to the new emperor.  But the tasks kept building
and building - probably even The Old Man would have begun to have trouble by,
oh, 1955 or 1956.  For one thing, there were the lawyers, swarming over the
consent decree like smoke-maddened hornets.

<p>

Then there was competition.  It amazed me to discover that everyone I met in
or near 590 was deeply worried by the GE entry.  I spent a large part of my
time in the first months of 1958 telling everybody who would hold still to
forget the Menace Of Phoenix.  It was hard for IBMers accustomed to having
every resource of their company at Watsonian disposition, to imagine a
universe where far greater resources were so partitioned by decentralization,
<a name="[-246-]"><font color="red">[-246-]</font></a>
and so abused by senior managers who had no feel for the product, that a
fledgling effort could die in the nest.

<p>

I tried to play the Smiddy statistical view for them: that GE expected a
considerable number of failures among a hundred and twenty profit centers;
that the shareholders only cared about the bottom bottom line.  The few who
believed me went away to pray to Watson-Who-Art-In-Heaven that such horrors
never shadow Tom Junior's empire.

<p>

The move to Manhattan had gone smoothly.  Elizabeth and Aunt Grace and
D?odat had driven east, stopping at favorite scenic spots in Utah and
Colorado to store up memories; all three of them had loved the western
landscape and the western scale and openness.  Of the four of us, only Grace
did not revel in New York, and she enjoyed it vicariously through Elizabeth's
eyes.  She was almost eighty, and to be uprooted twice in two years after many
decades in a small Ohio town, and driven back and forth across the continent,
had to be a little, um, startling.

<p>

The jokes about "I've Been Moved" went back before the war.  It was deliberate
Watson policy not to promote a man (or, after the Forties, a woman) to be in
charge of people he had been working with.  That meant most promotions, and
all those outside major enclaves, involved relocation.  The machinery was
well-exercised.

<p>

In my case the principal problem was the desert house.  The Phoenix barracudas
circled the rather small IBM office, anticipating the feast.  The offers
reported were astoundingly low, and sparse; I had warned the IBM
administrative man that if word got out that the company was guaranteeing my
equity the real estate mob would eat him alive.  After six months the final
stage of IBM procedures took over; careful appraisals yielded a value for the
property (which included four acres of land), and IBM offered to pay me that,
and close out the relocation.  They were then free to sell for whatever they
chose; I would drop out of the picture.

<p>

I accepted with alacrity.  They soon sold at a ridiculously low figure,
presumably to a disguised barracuda; how the shoal decided which hungry fish
was to have the meal remained a mystery.  The company not only made the
mortgage payments while all this was going on, but paid me interest on my
equity for the time it had been tied up.  I emphasize that this was standard
practice for a senior employee, not something special for a Prodigal Son.
They lost at least $15,000.

<p>

There was also a generous allowance at move time for carpets and drapes and
such.  Elizabeth added a sizable chunk of my capital and upgraded our
furniture, including slip covers (I had warned her about New York soot) and
curtains and drapes.  The carpet we bought from the nice Utah couple who had
been in the apartment.  The total effect was lovely.  She had salvaged the
crystal chandelier pieces from her Wauseon mansion (the sale price of which
she carefully refrained from merging with my funds).  One of my happier
mathematical tasks was to work up an optimum arrangement of the six or eight
kinds of prisms, to go over our dining room table.

<p>

While all these domestic maneuvers were going on, I was getting used to being
De Carlo's alter ego.  Wasn't hard; almost everything he did was something I
already had done, or could do, or knew about.  The only problem was
<a name="[-247-]"><font color="red">[-247-]</font></a>
not to overlay his preferred responses with arrant Groschisms - in spite of my
assurances to Tom Junior, I hadn't changed all that much, and my freedoms in
Generous Electric had left me even more vigorous than when IBM had extruded me
six years before.

<p>

That vigor was partly absorbed by the necessities of finding out what had been
going on inside IBM while I had been away - a great deal, needless to say!
The seething mass of programmers in 425 was soon a concern; although it was
only one of five or six areas that Charlie managed, it was consuming much of
his attention, and he welcomed my intervention.  Jack Ahlin did not.

<p>

The Band Of Brothers had been transformed into a formal structure called SHARE
- the oldest and most famous of the computer user organizations worldwide.  I
had been one of the dozen or so founders, of course, and the installation
symbol GE in the original 1956 list of members stood for Evendale.  As it
evolved away from a beat-on-IBM cabal toward a technical-exchange group (an
evolution very warmly encouraged by Cuthbert Hurd, and now by my new boss De
Carlo), I had put Don Shell in as the key General Electric man.  He backed
away from officership as the organization grew, but offered his exceedingly
effective 701 interpreters and 704 compilers to be SHAREd.  The 704 utilities
were working several months before either those at IBM or at the other early
704 installations; this was primarily because Don and his sidekicks Jim Porter
and Dorothea Clarke were so good, but also because I had protected them
against the slings and arrows of daily 701 service operations.

<p>

During the time I had been in Arizona, IBM had solicited inputs from all SHARE
members concerning the next big scientific machine and its system programs.
For instance, John Lowe of Douglas, still a dominant figure in the Los Angeles
area, had actually passed up the 704s, settling for core memory on his 701 or
701s (remember how underpriced the 701 had been?).  He had definite ideas
about what it would take to get him - and because of his position, most of the
other Douglas installations - to order what was to be called the 709.  And
everybody, including Shell in Evendale and my crew in Tempe, had ideas about
programming tools to accompany the machine.

<p>

Today we would use the catchword "environment"; in 1957 the computer tribe had
only just invented the term "operating system".  The SHARE officers got the
members together and produced tentative specs for hardware and for the system
software.  IBM did not pay too much attention to the former; there were very
tough guys like Jerry Haddad in the development groups, masked by the benign
smiles of Applied Science.  But it took the software specs seriously - too
seriously.

<p>

Ahlin, who I vaguely remember had come to IBM with a petroleum background, was
told to build up a group to write SOS, the SHARE Operating System, and have it
ready to test on the 709 prototype before announcement.  He had started with a
half dozen of the best: experienced programmers from the old SSEC and 701<br>
groups.  I think John Backus was still in the gang, although he must have
already had his dreams about FORTRAN by then.  There was Harlan Herrick and
Ruth Levy and Elaine Boehm, and two or three others.

<p>

Jack made a terrible mistake.  It had already been made out in the world,
<a name="[-248-]"><font color="red">[-248-]</font></a>
notably at SDC, the Systems Development Corporation, when that was spun off
from RAND.  But it was new among IBM programming projects.  He sent word over
to 590: "Hire me a hundred sharp programmers."  How familiar it sounds today;
dumb outfits like Citicorp and Travellers have made the tactic common, and
have even added a zero to Ahlin's 100!

<p>

IBM was a great draw, even at a time when programmers were as scarce as hen's
teeth.  The raw recruits began arriving; the trickle became a stream; 425
bulged with new bods.  The original experts, who could otherwise have been
writing SOS, turned to organizing and tutoring the newcomers - and, being
mostly introverts (Elaine was a popular exception), did a rather poor job.
The 709 was announced, without software.  SHARE came hammering on the door.
Lowe And Co. were unhappy with the machine specifications.  And everybody was
worried about SOS.

<p>

By the time I hired in, the crisis was in full bloom.  Charlie had begun to
realize that more was not better: that the original small group and a few
assistants (chosen by them, as Shell had chosen Porter and Clarke) would have
finished the job by now.  But it was too late.  The task had been organized to
death, split up into fifty chunks and a thousand interfaces; there were
supervisors, of course, and they were competing vigorously - not least because
Ahlin's slot was clearly going to be open very shortly.  It was a horrid,
horrid mess.

<p>

I was just too late to help with the key decision, which was made by De Carlo
with advice from Don Pendery on the West Coast.  Ahlin was replaced by Don
Furth, known throughout the Hurd family as having the reddest hair and the
most freckles in California.  Don "repaired" the damage (actually, he just
about started the whole business over - as proven by the fact that he cut down
the SOS objectives along with the surplus coders).  I tried to be useful, but
there wasn't much I could do except pat Furth on the back, and of course tell
Charlie how right he had been.  SOS came out late, and a pale ghost of the
original robust specification, but it came out.

<p>

A probably unintended consequence of the fiasco, and of a certain amount of
unhappiness with the new hardware, was the considerable diminution of SHARE
aggressiveness.  The Band Of Brothers (and Dottie Blum) had clearly known more
about big computers and engineering utilization, collectively at least, than
IBM itself.  So SHARE insisted on telling the company what to build and how to
program - and the result was a bust.  There was a current of "Let's Be Good"
in SHARE already, supported by peaceful intellectuals like Shell, and a fair
number of sycophants who hoped to work for Cuthbert some day.  It turned into
a tide, and washed over the Lowes and the Strongs and the Armers.  The battle
never rejoined; IBM support for SHARE (printing and distribution, and early
information, and even - shhh! - a cocktail party or two at the semiannual
bashes) grew and grew.  The world's first user group had been captured.

<p>

There were two other major software operations in 425, and they were very
different from painful SOS.  One was an almost solo effort by Bob Bemer, whom
I knew quite well from his Lockheed adventure.  He had joined IBM a short time
before I came, and was designing a commercial language which he fondly hoped
would rival FORTRAN.  The papers I have are labeled
<a name="[-249-]"><font color="red">[-249-]</font></a>
X-TRAN, but there were
lots of possible names under consideration.  Bob was the logical choice to pit
against Grace Hopper and Howard Bromberg and Joe Wegstein in the
Pentagon-sponsored committee which was trying, shades of ADA, to develop an
agreed standard commercial language.  The diplomatic father of this attempt
was one Charlie Phillips of the Controller's Office, and what came out in the
end was COBOL, the Common Business-Oriented Language which is the major
compiled mainframe language over the whole world today.

<p>

It was one of the few successful committee projects in the long history of the
programming business, and one of the few usable "standards".  Many of the
pieces were due to Bemer, and many others to Everybody's Favorite Computer
Person, Grace Hopper.

<p>

An even more fascinating project was near Bemer's cubicle.  It was the first
piece of software for STRETCH, three years later to be called the 7030.  The
lead programmer, too engrossed in what he was doing to be a manager, was a
Bill Heising.  I hardly knew him, but soon discovered that he was the older
brother of the Heising that had been working on the jet engine simulator in
Evendale's Building 300 when I descended from on high in a cloud of concrete
dust - not optimum introductions to either the younger or the older brother.

<p>

He and two or three associates were doing an assembly language for the
hush-hush machine, and so far in advance of construction that the order code
could still be altered as their adventure indicated improvements.  This was
how the Kenyon Estate team had operated when the Defense Calculator was in
gestation, and I strongly approved.  Bill did not want me to know much about
his work, and indeed it was one of the top engineering secrets in IBM, made
more sensitive by the consent agreement not to flaunt paper machines.  I was
totally amazed to discover that the man building the machine was Red Dunwell,
who had reluctantly re-tubed the first 604 at Oak Ridge in 1949.  He had grown
great in nine years!

<p>

Three years later, when the final performances and prices of the STRETCH
components were made public, I had a crucial involvement with the system.  But
in early 1958, I had only an overview.  As a result of my first briefings, I
wrote De Carlo and Dunwell urging that a great deal more software be written,
starting right now; that Bill Heising's assembler needed to be imbedded in an
operating system - albeit a simpler one than SOS - and that FORTRAN or better
would be needed even for the prototype.  "The machine design is so different,
and so much more powerful, than the 701/704/709 architecture [I probably still
said 'structure'] that almost nothing can be transferred".  Deep silence.  I
sent a copy to McPherson, who had not seemed particularly elated at my
reappearance, even without the box of prunes.  More silence.

<p>

I decided this was a good time to try out De Carlo.  "Trouble with STRETCH,
Charlie, is that while it's the focus of design effort and technical
excitement in the company, the projected sales are microscopic.  You'll
remember it was like that when the 701 was on the drawing board - 300,000
points for the whole run; less than a month's sorter production.  Yet it
revolutionized the company".

<p>

"STRETCH can't do that, Herb", he replied.  "we're doing it to help a few
special customers like Los Alamos, and to counter the publicity about LARC
<a name="[-250-]"><font color="red">[-250-]</font></a>
[the first Rem Rand supercomputer]".

<p>

"Just like 1950, Charlie", I said, "same special customers, and LARC instead
of UNIVAC I.

<p>

"It's our first shot with fast transistors", I went on, "and the first
Freon-cooled scratchpad memory.  This look-ahead thing is bound to catch on,
even if Dunwell and his boys don't have any statistics to back up the idea.
But gee! none of it will startle anybody if we can't run impressive
demonstrations, and you can't have demos without software".

<p>

"Herb, I've got a hundred men and women eating their heads off out there.
What do you want me to do?  Reassign them?  Bill doesn't want `em".  "Neither
would I, Charlie", I said, laughing.  "But I can get you four or five more
Heisings if you want, and if you lock Backus and Greenstadt up in a quiet room
somewhere they could grind you out a better FORTRAN in a year".  "John would
quit first", said De Carlo.  "Depends where you put the room, Boss", I said.
Didn't work.

<p>

About this time I had disturbing news for Elizabeth.  The whole De Carlo
shebang was to be moved to larger quarters in White Plains (I made myself
unpopular with those in favor of the move by re-christening it Pallid Flats).
Even with IBM's easy policy about relocation, it was extremely unlikely she
and I would get much financial support for a move.  Most of the senior people
affected already lived in Westchester; Charlie and Dorothy De Carlo lived in
Bronxville, and were delighted.  Those few who lived in Jersey would probably
ask for re-assignment, but that was ruled out in my case by my coming in
through Tom Junior.  Besides, we liked not-at-all-pallid Manhattan.

<p>

The solution was obvious: reverse commute.  Even in those days the stream of
commuter automobiles into Manhattan every morning was horrendous, and most
commuters came by train or bus.  But the counter-flow was light.  Elizabeth's
blue Chevvie was in the Sutton House garage, relatively unscarred by its first
springtime excursions.  I would drive out to Pallid Flats each morning, park
in assigned space in the IBM garage, and reverse in the evening, free of train
schedules and such.  And we could still walk to the theater.

<p>

Three stories about those days - two cute, one grim.  Charlie had been invited
to be on a program at USC in Los Angeles, and couldn't fit it in.  He sent me.
No problem: if someone would tell me what to talk about as I got up, and for
how long, I could do several speeches a day.  Well, it turned out this one was
at a conference sponsored by the School of Library Science (Charlie would be
chagrined to know the inviting dean was indeed very inviting).  I gave the
audience a mixture of Pete Luhn, small computers, and the Imperial Watsons.
There was considerable applause.

<p>

When we broke up two older librarian-type ladies claimed me.  "Doctor, we
understand you have a lot to do with IBM support of special projects.  We have
been working on one for our library, with help from the downtown IBM manager -
he has loaned us a keypunch and a sorter, and lets us come in at night and use
a tabulator.  But he is getting impatient, so we thought perhaps you could
help us".  "Yes, my boss Dr. De Carlo does indeed monitor some of the things
we are doing with universities.  But we normally support only projects that
are so unusual that normal funding is not yet available, or projects that may
turn into future business after a first demonstration".

<p>
<a name="[-251-]"><font color="red">[-251-]</font></a>

"Yes, your manager explained that.  We are putting together a punched card
catalog of the books in the Los Angeles Children's Library, and expect copies
to be in great demand if we can finish it".  "Ladies, I can understand putting
the LC or the British Museum books on cards, but why in the world would other
librarians want your children's thing", I said, puzzled.  "You don't
understand the economics of a popular library, Doctor.  It costs so much more
to access and catalog a cheap book than to buy it in the first place that
children's libraries all over the country will order copies of our catalog and
buy the books to match".

<p>

Mamma mia!!  The secret of cheap, effective single-application (or personal)
computing, spread out before me in 1958!  I saw the point instantly, and have
told the story a hundred times to illustrate it.  Get a computer program that
does about what you want, and modify your requirements to fit the program!

<p>

The second story is a somber one, illustrating once more that there was a dark
side to the imperial splendors of IBM.  The top managers of the domestic
company were called together in Williamsburg, Virginia, and the long-awaited
reorganization was announced by Tom and the heads of the new outfits.  The
details don't matter any more; IBM now reorganizes every few years, and that
first effort, trumpeted to the rest of the company in a thick special issue of
BUSINESS MACHINES, is only of interest to historians.  It was notable because
the organization chart, with all its surround of formal management, had
finally come to T.J.'s empire.  Life was made easier for newcomers, although
not every power source was unveiled.  I looked in vain for George Richter,
presumably still The Gray Eminence of factory production.  I also noted that,
unlike inside General Electric, there was no explicit invitation to
communicate other than over the direct channels of authority; you always had
done it in the old IBM, but at considerable personal risk.

<p>

Everybody in White Plains except a small contingent of secretaries, left
behind to answer the phones, gathered in a local theater (IBM was too new in
the town to yet have its own auditorium).  Tom Junior sent a message; he was
running parallel meetings in Manhattan.  Ours was chaired by Maclean Smith,
who was locked in battle with Vin Learson for the Number Two spot in the
company - the new charts were being scanned carefully to see how that battle
was going.

<p>

Mac described the Williamsburg sessions and gave a short summary of how the
decisions had been arrived at (no mention of the consultants).  He then gave a
short overview of the results, concentrating on the parts of the new divisions
which had been or would be in White Plains.  He announced, to audible gasps
from the audience, that the monolithic marketing structure so familiar to
everybody would be split three ways.  And he called on the man who had been in
charge of the huge outfit, the Praetorian Guard of the Watson Empire, to give
the details.

<p>

Remember the third requirement for lifelong IBM job security?  Well, here it
was in its cruelest form.  Poor Bob, who had just lost the richest
principality in the realm, had to introduce the three men who would succeed
him, describe his own new assignment (it wasn't Anchorage, but it wasn't
anything very great either), and thank IBM and Tom and Mac for the wonderful
opportunity!

<p>
<a name="[-252-]"><font color="red">[-252-]</font></a>

Doesn't sound all that beastly in cold print, and after four decades.  But it
turned me inside out at the time.  There were damp eyes in the audience, and
not only among the secretaries; Bob was popular.  Yes, he kissed the hand -
but it hurt to watch.

<p>

There is an enormous enthusiasm today for what has been re-christened "expert
systems".  I agree; wonderful stuff!  But the idea is not new: to imbed the
knowledge, the know-how, the practices of a valuable individual or team in a
computer program.  The famous Los Alamos nuclear codes, dating back to CPC
days and updated and expanded a dozen times into the Cray generations,
contained the expertise of top physicists and bomb designers.  Every
chess-playing program, whether in software or hardwired, embodies the chess
tactics and strategies of its master.  And while I had an office in Pallid
Flats I watched perhaps the earliest attempt to intentionally model a single
human being.

<p>

I've referred a dozen times to George Richter.  He was hidden away from the
customers, in the very heart of IBM.  He was a little guy, one of the original
employees that Watson Senior had gathered in the Twenties.  He had gobs of IBM
stock which, split again and again and again, made him a millionaire several
times over.  There was at that time no formal retirement age in the company,
but George was certainly in his sixties.  He was balding, gray, but still
vigorous - back in my previous incarnation I had called him "the only man in
IBM authorized to use the name of a customer and 'son of a bitch' in the same
sentence".

<p>

In some arcane fashion he allocated, and in earlier times had in fact
controlled, factory production.  He reacted to calls and notes from
T.J. himself, of course, and from the most senior and powerful sales
executives: Red LaMotte, for example.  He was at the precise and hottest focus
of ultimate deliveries; to cement a sale or salvage a disaster he could reach
into Endicott or Poughkeepsie assembly lines and test areas and produce six
keypunches, or a 407 tabulator, or two 709 tape drives - and move everything
else around so as to conceal or minimize the damage.

<p>

By sheer coincidence he had the office next to mine in White Plains, although
he didn't work for De Carlo (in fact, it's hard to imagine whom he did work
for).  He had printouts of factory schedules stacked neatly on his desk, but
no other visible apparatus; I don't even remember a secretary.  He did the
intricate permutations and rearrangements in his head, apparently.  I never
knew for sure, but I doubt if he issued written orders; he would call a
department manager at one of the factories, and that manager did the
paperwork.

<p>

Those of us in the know all wondered what would happen when George took his
bundles of IBM stock and left for Florida.  We couldn't imagine how he could
get through even the first day without a factory to turn upside down.  And we
couldn't imagine how IBM would operate without him.  He and I were quite in
tune - two cynics.  His office was plastered with Hundred Percent Club awards
memorializing his exceptional performance in 19xx, when factory deliveries
came within 0.6 percent of quota.  We laughed heartily about it; he set the
blasted quotas, he said, and revised `em every day!

<p>

One day an innocent young Ph.D. psychologist named Ivan Rezucha
<a name="[-253-]"><font color="red">[-253-]</font></a>
appeared on
the scene.  He had been charged with modeling The Gray Eminence, so that when
George finally left for sunnier climes a computer program could take over.
Really!  In 1958!

<p>

George was surprisingly gentle with him; only ripped him up and down a few
times a week.  And he was genuinely cooperative; didn't try to conceal how he
operated, or mislead the youngster.  But it was hopeless.  George really
didn't know how he did what he did (they had warned Ivan about that in
advance), and I strongly suspect his procedures changed from day to day, and
by no means smoothly.  He was still at work when I was ejected a few months
later.  Maybe they attached his head to a science fiction life support system,
and it is running the company right this minute from a heavily guarded room in
Armonk?

<p>

The handsome apartment on 51st Street was being readied for an elaborate
Christmas.  Elizabeth bought a gorgeous tree (we were shocked at the price,
compared to Arizona), and I put up a mobile made of extra ornaments.
Elizabeth bought Grace a lavish mink stole to match her blue-gray hair, and I
bought Elizabeth a thousand dollar bill - the only one either of us had ever
seen.  I got dozens of presents, notably a wonderful dog-walking coat that I
still used in 1991.  It was the most sumptuous Christmas any of us, including
Deo, had ever had.  New York is at its very best in the holiday season; I knew
it from previous years, and Elizabeth and Grace concurred.

<p>

All four of us had participated in the von Braun visit to Poughkeepsie a month
or two earlier.  Grace and Deodat had enjoyed West Point, and Elizabeth had
enjoyed Wernher.  I was in very good odor with Charlie Benton, the head of
Military Products.  It was time for me to get myself a line job again; De
Carlo had capitalized on the 7090 excitement and moved up, leaving me to his
successor, whom I did not like.  For the machine buffs, I should tell about
that 7090.

<p>

There were many of my old Defense Calculator friends working for Red Dunwell
on STRETCH, along with some strong newcomers, notably Fred Brooks.  For
instance, Werner Buchholz and Mort Astrahan were deeply into the systems
design, which Fred dominated.  They knew, as Frank Hamilton told me after the
SSEC success, that real prestige in IBM came from fathering a production
machine.  An SSEC, a NORC, Pete Luhn's chemical-structure sorter, counted for
less than a chain printer, and much less than a 650.  They cast about.

<p>

Soon there began to be meetings about BABY STRETCH.  It was to be a
new-architecture machine to succeed the 709 as the principal scientific
mainframe.  Charlie sent me to the sessions as his representative, just as he
had previously sent me to the new IBM Research reviews.  I was negative,
partly because all the valuable 704/709 software would have to be done over,
mostly because it seemed to my amateur eye that the plan retained all the
clumsy parts of the huge parent machine - the lengthy order code, for instance
- and dropped the powerful stuff like look-ahead.

<p>

One Sunday evening I got a call from Poughkeepsie; one of the bright young
guys on the outskirts of De Carlo's operation had had a weekend brainstorm.
Charlie and Dorothy were out, and he had to unload on somebody or burst.  His
name, by the way, was Graham Something - either
<a name="[-254-]"><font color="red">[-254-]</font></a>
Jones or Smith.  Another
Graham, either Smith or Jones, worked at about the same level in UNIVAC, and I
can never remember which was which.  Anyhow, Our Graham had come up with the
idea of mapping the exact 709 structure onto high speed STRETCH transistors,
retaining most of the peripheral equipment unaltered.  I was the second person
in the world - no, the third; he was married - to hear of the 7090.

<p>

Both Charlie and I were instant converts.  He took the idea upstairs Monday
morning, and it spread like wildfire. In a week it had killed BABY STRETCH; my
old and new friends never really forgave me.  In a month the circuits were in
test.  In six months, the first production machine was shipped.  It was a
fantasy come to life.  What happened to Our Graham?  I never knew.

<p>

I talked to Benton about starting a software group for him.  One of his
largest product lines made the SAGE computers, which he built in Kingston for
the Air Force and the Lincoln Labs of MIT.  There was supposed to be a SAGE II
in the works, and I pointed out that the Systems Development shop in Santa
Monica would get another contract to do training and programming - a contract
that IBM could probably have if it geared up to bid (hundreds and hundreds of
programmers).  I emphasized that, as in my great shops in Evendale and Tempe,
such a group would have to be at the same level as engineering.  The head of
Benton's engineering, who planned to take over from McPherson some day,
thought that a very poor idea.  Strike One!

<p>

Benton borrowed my services from De Carlo's successor and sent me out to
survey SDC and IBM software capabilities in the air defense area.  I reported
back that the only large bunch of programmers I had ever seen conspicuously
worse than SDC was their IBM Kingston counterpart.  The message was not well
received.  Strike Two!

<p>

I went over to talk to the executive newly placed in charge of the Service
Bureau Corporation, suggesting that a cooperation between his crowd and
Benton's SAGE II hardware people would solve the organizational problem.  I
promptly got a venomous memo from Vin Learson, to whom the SBC chief and
Charlie Benton both reported, telling me to keep my @#$%^&amp; fingers out of his
businesses.  Strike Three!

<p>

Benton had not forgotten my link to Huntsville, however.  NASA was being
formed in Washington, to pull together the fragmented but popular U.S. space
program.  He had a marketing manager, a weak sister, under whom were program
managers for the Army, Navy, and Air Force - not at all weak sisters!
Probably because he remembered how I had easily beat out his people for my
Huntsville contract, Charlie offered me the program managership for NASA and
other space activities.

<p>

I would probably need to move to Washington, he said, but first we should see
where the power center for NASA developed.  "Charlie, I have to tell you I'd
quit before I'd move to Huntsville", I warned him.  "Not likely", he said,
"West Coast, perhaps - or if it gets spread around fast enough, maybe you will
want to stay right here".  I agreed.

<p>

There was an early IBM contribution to the national space effort in
Washington, on Pennsylvania Avenue.  The company had put in a 709 and a team
of ex-Watson-Lab types (with advice from Wally Eckert), and was doing
<a name="[-255-]"><font color="red">[-255-]</font></a>
trajectory and orbit calculations on a mostly-gratis basis.  Twenty people or
so, including Bruce Oldfield, who had been Number Two on the Inyokern 701, and
who had joined IBM to get the Washington job.  I was sure Bruce would not
resent working for me.  Benton gave me that.

<p>

Then there were small teams of sales engineers who were chasing specific
contracts, offering hardware capabilities at the IBM plants in Kingston and
Owego.  And there were two or three men in Owego, who furnished dope to the
sales types.  They came to me also.  No problem; in fact Bob Ellsworth, the
top sales engineer, and I liked each other immediately.

<p>

There was to be a major press release.  I remember a fairly long discussion
with some PR types - yes, they had a few hiding in the bushes at Galactic
Headquarters, just as there had been secret beancounters back in 1947.  The
question was whether to point to my Huntsville exploit, and mention GE (but
not the Computer Department, we agreed), or just to focus on the NASA Center
[new name] and my Rocket Society presidency.  I suggested that the
announcement be separate from the re-naming and re-dedication of the 709 shop:
"Hit `em twice, a month apart", I said.

<p>

I asked about a raise.  "You've only been back a year, Grosch", said Benton.
"They snatched De Carlo away before he could reward my sterling qualities,
Charlie", I smiled.  He grudgingly upped me to $25,000; I was aware that Gus,
my direct boss, had been a star commercial salesman and therefore must be
getting three times as much - maybe even more than Benton.  Most of the
Military Products salesmen were on salary, not commission.  Also I could smell
a lot of politics in the wind.  I shrugged it off, and took Elizabeth out to
celebrate.

<p>

Spring was in the air, and crocuses and conferences were blooming.  Benton had
received an invitation for IBM to participate in a big meeting in Pasadena,
before my appointment.  He had passed up an opportunity to have someone give a
paper - I would have been delighted, of course - but now named me the official
IBM representative.  The delegation included Wallace Eckert and By Havens, and
a couple of Owego types who did not work for me.

<p>

The conference was novel: "The Realities Of Space Exploration".  It was to be
at Cal Tech, sponsored by the Institute itself, and with Lee DuBridge
presiding in person.  He was in the middle of his term as president [1959], a
job he left a decade later to be Eisenhower's science advisor; he was the
former head of the wartime Radiation Lab at MIT - that accounted for By
Havens, of course; he was on the RAND board; he was writing a book about the
space effort.  He had called the conference to discuss for the first time what
advantages and disadvantages there were for American industry, for American
and world science, and for humanity as a whole, out beyond the atmosphere.

<p>

It was a beautiful late Spring day, almost free of smog.  I saw many old
friends, and not just from Rocket Society and Columbia days.  There was a fair
contingent from Huntsville, but not von Braun.  The recently confirmed
administrator of brand-new NASA, Keith Glennan, was the center of a group of
eager marketing types.  Harold Urey, the Nobelist, and several other
generalists of the same level, were conspicuous.  I said a brief hello to
Louis Ridenour, who had just left the chairmanship of International Telemeter
(plug-compatible core memories, with Paramount Pictures funding) to become
head of a new Lockheed Electronics Corporation.  Louis had been a
<a name="[-256-]"><font color="red">[-256-]</font></a>
leader at the Radiation Labs, and like Havens was really there at the call of
DuBridge; he had edited the enormous postwar set of Rad Lab publications, and
had gone on to be Dean of the Graduate School at Urbana before he started
Telemeter.

<p>

We had all gotten together socially Thursday night, and the meeting was
scheduled for the following day only.  All papers were invited, and the
morning session went smoothly.  Lunch was catered, and pleasant; I wanted to
sit with Eckert, but he was involved with his old friend Urey.

<p>

The last paper of the day was the one by Ridenour, and it was much more
raucous than the earlier ones.  To my mild surprise, he criticized the whole
idea of space exploration, even unmanned ventures, on the grounds that we had
enormous problems here on Earth that could better occupy our technology.  I
certainly agreed with his thesis, but was startled to hear it from a vice
president of Lockheed; moreover, I hadn't remembered Louis as being very
socially conscious.  For my part, I had spoken at the Rome IAF meeting in
1956, before Sputnik, as being very much in favor of unmanned,
computer-controlled scientific space experiments: "We only make [them] more
difficult if we insist on taking human bodies along ....", I had said.

<p>

The audience was restive.  I got the floor and said, "Dr. Ridenour, we badly
need to extend the reach of science out beyond the atmosphere.  I agree that
we must not divert too many resources away from human problems, but to cancel
what we are planning would be the swan song of a dying culture".  Urey sprang
to his feet and made some fairly impassioned remarks about human creativity,
noting that the tomb of Tamerlane (which he had just visited) was a monument
also to that creativity.  I wasn't certain which side he was on - if indeed
there were sides.  There certainly were cross-currents!

<p>

I got up again and said, "Harold, creativity is all very well, but when that
tomb of yours can be destroyed by missiles, as Williams of RAND said the other
day, 'in a thousand breaths', we have to direct that creativity rather
carefully".  There was a series of such remarks, all vigorous.  Ridenour did
not respond.  DuBridge said these were exactly the sort of ideas that he had
hoped the meeting would generate; he thanked us for coming, and we broke up.

<p>

I flew back on the Red-Eye, which was still a Super-Connie; the 707 jets had
just been introduced, but first class with pull-out leg support, and a
nine-hour flight, made for much better snoozing.  I got to the apartment early
enough to walk Deo.

<p>

I had expected a quiet Saturday.  Early in the afternoon I got a call from Bob
Truax, a Navy captain who had also been a president of the ARS.  He was on
weekend duty at the Pentagon.  "What the hell did you do, Herb?" he laughed.
"I got this telegram from IBM implying you did something against orders, and
disowning you for your sins".  "God only knows, Bob.  Who signed it?"
"T. Vincent Learson.  Mean anything to you?"  "Baa-aad news. That's the top
guy in IBM below Tom Watson".  Long silence.  "Thanks very much for calling,
old boy.  I'll send you a postcard from Anchorage."

<p>

A couple of other calls came in.  I was in the papers, and in more than one
city.  I rushed out to the corner and got a Times.  On the front page, center
bottom, in exactly the same place where that august journal had announced
<a name="[-257-]"><font color="red">[-257-]</font></a>
the ENIAC in 1946, was a major story.  The headline read, "IBM Scientist Calls
Missile Program 'Swan Song of a Dying Culture'".  Oh, oh, oh!

<p>

It was a problem to piece things together.  It was a Saturday.  Most of the
attendees at the Cal Tech conference were not home yet.  IBM itself was pretty
much shut down.  By Monday noon I had most of the story.  It had,
unfortunately for me, been a quiet Saturday for news.  The Los Angeles Times
had had a staffer or a stringer at the Cal Tech conference - which Ridenour
apparently never knew, and I found out only as the meeting broke up.  The
paper put the story out on the AP wire, and it was carried in over 150 cities.

<p>

One of the newspapers was in Owego, where IBM built most of its military stuff
in those days.  They got the plant manager out of bed, and asked him to
comment.  His name was Johnson, I think - I didn't know him.  He said exactly
the right thing: "I'll have to see what Dr. Grosch actually did.  Meanwhile, I
can tell you that IBM and the Owego operation fully support the national
defense programs".

<p>

Alas, in Greenwich, Connecticut, bedroom suburb for the top IBM brass, things
did not go so well.  The local paper got Charlie Benton out of bed also, and
he blew it. First he claimed he didn't know I was out in Pasadena.  Then he
denounced me six ways from Sunday - I mean, Saturday.  He got rid of the
reporter, who immediately set to work on a follow-up with the headline, "IBM
Repudiates Space Manager", or some such.

<p>

Benton called Vin Learson.  They met at Benton's office off Madison Avenue and
drafted the telegram, which Benton then had sent out to all the space-related
agencies he could think of, including not only government outfits like the
Navy, but a bunch of contractors.  All this time I was sitting only a mile
away, completely unaware of the excitement.  Nobody thought to call me.

<p>

The game was joined.  My direct boss Gus Rathe chickened out, telling me in a
one-minute meeting that Benton and Learson had taken me over.  Benton was very
worried there might be a comeback from outside; that NASA's Glennan might come
down on him, for example, or Western Electric, which I was just getting into
bed with for a bid on Project Mercury when all this blew up.  Never happened;
this sort of criticism was old stuff in Washington, even if it turned IBM
managers green in Greenwich.

<p>

But the real battle was Learson versus Grosch.  Vin had done a bad thing for
the company, and a very bad thing for me.  He had apologized for what might
indeed have been a rather damaging remark, and disowned me for making it -
meaning that he had ruined any further connection for me with the space
program - without getting the facts.  He had failed to check with me, or with
Havens or Eckert, or with DuBridge, about what had actually happened.
DuBridge sent me a tape of the session, and a letter explicitly disavowing the
story.  Havens and Eckert both tried to tell Benton I wasn't guilty.  It was
hopeless.  One of us, Learson or Grosch, had committed a serious crime.  One
of us was going to suffer.  Vin Learson had a very clear view which.

<p>

While I was being bastinadoed daily by Learson and his henchmen, something
much more tragic happened.  Ridenour had also been featured in the original
story, and it had been made very clear that he had said naughty things
<a name="[-258-]"><font color="red">[-258-]</font></a>
(and from the point of Lockheed, he certainly had).  He was also under great
pressure.  One morning he was found dead on the floor of a Washington hotel
suite: a stroke or heart attack.  He had a florid complexion and a
football-coach physique.  But he had a sharp and still creative mind, and of
course a family.  My trouble paled by comparison.

<p>

IBM had a famous Open Door Policy.  Disciplinary matters could be appealed
upstairs, all the way to a Watson if necessary.  I knew all about it.  I could
see the open door in the distance, figuratively speaking.  I could see my
erstwhile friend Tom Junior sitting inside.  But Vin lay between me and the
door, like Cerberus, with all three heads alert and all three sets of fangs
dripping venom.  I sent off the DuBridge letter.  It never got inside.  Months
later, when I finally got a message through to Tom from outside the company,
he wrote me that I should have tried harder!

<p>

My IBM friends, all but a very few, suddenly found me too wraithlike to
recognize in the corridors.  Young Ellsworth, who had known me for only a few
weeks, was warmer and more supportive than DeCarlo, and my cowardly boss Gus
disappeared completely.  The best offer I got was from Learson: to become
manager of STRETCH publications (Heiser's assembly language manual), at my
current $25,000 salary; to move to Poughkeepsie, and "keep your goddamned
mouth shut".

<p>

One problem was that Vin was physically threatening.  He was six four or five,
lean and hatchet-faced.  He would tower over me and grind away.  And it was
known all over Galactic Headquarters that he enjoyed the carnage: liked to
count the skulls pyramided outside his office suite.  One day, after a
particularly painful exchange, I said to him, "Vin, this whole company is
crawling with guys who want to imitate everything you say and do.  Isn't there
room for just one who wouldn't be like you on a bet?"  "Be over here at ten
tomorrow", he growled.

<p>

After six weeks I gave up.  I wasn't getting any closer to the Open Door.
Clearly as soon as I ceased to be a Big Story I would be quietly slaughtered
and disposed of.  I tried again to get shipped overseas; not a chance.  Even
Anchorage would have kept me in IBM, but Learson owned Anchorage too.  I
resigned.  It's noteworthy that I did not get a golden handshake.

<p>

In spite of my notable transparency in Headquarters halls, my treatment and my
departure did not go unnoticed, especially among the technical types.  It had
gotten about that I had not really said bad things about the missile program,
and this in spite of the fact that I didn't swear fealty - I really kind of
thought the missile program was the swansong of a dying culture, even if I
hadn't said so in Pasadena!

<p>

There were rumblings.  One day Tom Junior circulated a very unorthodox
memorandum.  I never saw a copy myself, but it is supposed to have said,
"Fellas, it's not true that there is only room in IBM for trained pigeons.  We
need wild ducks too".  It was immediately christened The Wild Duck Memo, and
it is resurrected every few years - officially - and passed around at
management levels.  Those memorial rites, and the use of "Ready" instead of
"Idle" on machine status lights, are the last marks of my sojourn in the
world's greatest company.

<p>

One last story: on 13 September 1973, more than fourteen years after The Wild
Duck Memo was first circulated, I was taking my new boss Pat McGovern,
publisher of COMPUTERWORLD, to a luncheon with Tom Watson and Frank Cary and
Gil Jones, in a lovely private dining room in Armonk.  Somebody, probably
Horace Post, had done the usual thorough job on the visitors, and turned up
the fact that it was my 55th birthday.

<p>

We are waiting for Tom to appear.  Suddenly the door bursts open and in he
comes, carrying a Seagram
<a name="[-259-]"><font color="red">[-259-]</font></a>
carton (!!through the sacred halls of IBM!!).  He
sets it down and pulls out an antique duck decoy he had bought for me from a
Vermont museum.  "For the original wild duck", he says!

I ended the first edition of my autobiography by telling about the 1959 Wild
Duck memorandum, and a memorial to it given me on my birthday years later -
and with a picture showing me holding that memorial decades later still.  But
in fact, I struggled for some weeks inside IBM after the memo came out, and
fitfully for some months after Vin Learson ran me off the premises.  Indeed,
in 1961 I managed to pry open the hard IBM carapace for a few weeks, and I'll
tell that story in Chapter 28.

<p>

But at this point I want to write in more detail about my last struggle as the
ostensible manager of IBM's space program.  In some sense the story is of a
watershed; I was aware at the time that I could never climb back into my
favorite company again if I kept poking at Pasadena instead of hunkering down
in Poughkeepsie for two or three years and waiting for Cerberus Learson to
take all of his heads and eyes elsewhere.

<p>

But I wanted to capitalize on the trouble, not just escape it - indeed, it was
pretty obvious that escape was impossible.  I had not really said that the
missile program was "the swansong of a dying culture", but I was convinced it
was Bad For Us, and that made denials that I had said any such thing much more
difficult.

<p>

So I worked hard on a short position paper.  If it was taken seriously, it
would help IBM and the nation, even if I still got ground to powder.  And it
just might get me through the Open Door, which didn't seem otherwise
reachable, and mitigate pulverization.

<p>

What I sent over to Tom Junior was this:

<p>
<blockquote>

<u>C O M P A N Y &nbsp; C O N F I D E N T I A L</u>
<p>
<div align="right"> April 12, 1959&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p>
To:      Mr. T. J. Watson, Jr.<br>
Subject: IBM Corporate Policy in the Missile/Space Area
<p>
This memorandum is a carefully considered and serious recommendation for
an IBM posture in a sensitive and important matter.  It may well be my
only contribution as Manager of Space Programs, wild-ducking being a
pretty hazardous business at best, and I hope you will read it
unimpatiently.
<p>
Our company has from its inception been concerned primarily with the
arts of peace.  There are a million jokes about "THINK"; I have never
heard anyone deride "World Peace Through World Trade".  On many
occasions we have gone out of our way to strengthen our corporate image
as a supporter of international friendships; we were early and
enthusiastic partisans for the UN.
<p>
Now we have a Military Products Division, and are actively beginning to
solicit contracts to design and manufacture specialized equipment for
the Department of Defense, the AEC, and NASA.  Vin Learson has told me,
in discussion of the Cal Tech incident, that IBM policy is "to go along
with the government" and to build anything it asks us to build.

<p>

I've thought about that statement a lot, and believe it needs careful
consideration.  In the first place, Learson was stating a practice, not a
policy - see Mac Smith's recent speech to DP <a name="[-262-]"><font
color="red">[-262-]</font></a> managers, for instance.  But more important,
and a major consideration for MP Marketing, is the fact we are now seeking out
contracts in the weapons business.  It is one thing to accede to a special
request to help defend the country </tt>[SAGE, of course]<tt>, where we
are told we are the only possible source, and our patriotism is invoked; it is
another thing entirely to go out and solicit responsibility for the delivery
of nuclear weapons on "area" targets (a euphemism for Hiroshima, Leningrad -
or New York).

<p>

I recommend most strongly, then, that in my own area of competence IBM,
through its MP Division, bid competitively only for contracts which are
primarily concerned with space exploration, and quietly but definitely
stop further solicitation of weapons and weapons system contracts.  We
are deeply involved in the B52 and B70 bomb delivery systems, and cannot
pull back in good faith.  But let us plan to convert the Owego
capabilities to less deadly projects at the earliest opportunity.  You
probably share my doubts about the soundness of the B70 concept, and its
chances of survival on the Washington scene; let us fill the gap that
may be left with something less likely to make us "merchants of death".

<p>

My enthusiasm for space projects is not particularly dampened by the
fact that much of the new science and technology resulting therefrom can
be and may be turned to offensive ends.  Our technical civilization is
so highly interconnected that any act, however peacefully intended, may
be turned against others.  If we help land on the moon, or if we track
and control a communications satellite, the good we do or hope to do
outweighs the bad.  Missiles are something else again!

<p>

This conviction does not stem from a pacifist persuasion, by the way.
Force still stalks abroad, and reasoned preparation to meet it is in my
mind quite justified.  But the missile race has become technically,
economically, and morally indefensible.  Russia has opened a gap in our
defenses which no American effort - even with good planning and without
wasteful duplication - can close.  We must win with other weapons; with
missiles we can only lose.

<p>

For this reason I recommend that we not waste the wonderful resources of
the IBM laboratories and factories, and especially people.  Let us
actively seek to employ them in solving the problems of space, and not
on projects of mass extermination.

<p>

It didn't fly.  My guess is that all copies were quietly picked up and
sequestered, including the original.  Whether Tom ever saw the attempt I've
never known, but he didn't refer to it in any subsequent correspondence over
the years, nor at the 1973 luncheon with Pat McGovern.  Probably only Horace
Post remembered.

<p>
<a name="[-263-]"><font color="red">[-263-]</font></a>

I waited a few weeks.  I tried again and again to see Tom: notes in
interoffice mail, calls to his office, often taken by Post.  The notes were
never answered; the promised appointment "as soon as Mr. Watson can see you"
never arrived.  A month went by.  It was now two months since the AP had blown
the whistle on me and on Ridenour.  I gave up.

During the past two months, you have been kind enough to review with me
several ways in which I might continue with IBM.  None of these appear
to fill our mutual requirements.  I should like to continue a friendly
association with you and with many others in the company.  But I shall
be better able to help advance the computer field from some other
vantage point.  Accordingly, I regretfully tender my resignation.

<p>

A hand-carried answer came back within hours: 

<p>

Memorandum to Dr. H. R. J. Grosch

<p>

I am in receipt of your letter of resignation today, and I want to
assure you that I am very regretful that you have arrived at this
conclusion.  I had hoped very much that the assignment we worked out for
you in the Data Systems Division as Manager of the STRETCH programming
area and all its ramifications was satisfactory </tt>[Poughkeepsie??]<tt>.

<p>

We will accept your resignation effective as of the end of May, and a
separation check for two months' pay will be mailed to you representing
all and final payments from the IBM Company.

<p>

I want to wish you the very best of luck in whatever endeavor you
undertake.  If I can personally be of any help to you, please let me
know.

<p>

Well, I spent the next week packing my office gear and library, finding an
outfit called Johnson that wanted my long runs of periodicals, notably a
complete set of early ACM publications and a complete set of MTAC.  How many
times over the last twenty years have I wanted them back: originally for
easy reference, and now because they would bring ten times what I sold them
for in 1959.  On Friday May the 29th I moved out; Benton and Learson had
sent the telegrams disowning me on March 28th.  I should have fought another
month at least.

From early 1958 on, there had been subterranean rumblings in ACM, in the
other NJCC partners IRE and AIEE at the Eastern and Western Joints, and in
the just-christened trade journal DATAmation, about a real international
meeting.  As soon as I was comfortable in Charlie De Carlo's skin, and
beginning to enjoy the way I could draw on many parts of IBM using his
authority (or to be more precise, the Watsonian authority that he was
permitted to exert), I probed for facts among the rumors.

<p>

The World Trade staff at Galactic Headquarters said they knew nothing, but
de Waldner's people on the Place Vend?me were alert.  WT Europe exhibits
people were being nibbled on by French academics and by special customers,
notably at Electricit? de France, who didn't ask for cash or commitment
but spoke enticingly about a big show in June of 1959, and if pressed
claimed it "might" be at the Grand Palais.  "J'entendu que le m?me," the
IBM contact at the Palais said, shrugging over the telephone.  No contract
had been offered.

<p>

As rumors circulated about a committee headed by Ike Auerbach, I began to
worry.  "That whole gang in Philadelphia is anti-IBM, Charlie," I warned.
"If they get something going, our people will be excluded as they were a
dozen or so years ago at the Moore School."

<p>

"Water over the dam," said my boss, who had SHARE and STRETCH and several
dozen 709 customers to keep in line.  Also he had no doubt been warned by
Tom Junior's secretary that I was overseas-happy; not a sparrow fell
unnoticed on the higher floors of 590.

<p>

As a knowledgeable editor named Sandy Lanzarotta took over at the Thompson
shop and upgraded the hind end from DATAmation to DATAMATION (and converted
the magazine from Connecticut to Los Angeles perspectives), the plot
thickened.  Yes, there was a committee; yes, Ike dominated it; yes, it was
working "on behalf of the U.S. information processing community" with its
European counterparts to mount a major conference in Paris or Rome in the
summer of 1959.  Rome, a location backed by the mysterious ICC,
International Computation Centre, which Elizabeth and I had encountered
while on honeymoon in 1956, was being outflanked by both Paris and
Philadelphia.

<p>

The key was of course funding.  The overseas men, whose names were never
mentioned in the first WJCC announcements and in the spring and summer
DATAMATION articles, had a pipeline in place into UNESCO's Paris
headquarters.  With that money, or promise of money, eager beavers on the
U.S.  side began to gnaw away.

<p>

A Ramo-Wooldridge consultant named Grabbe was named as exhibits chair,
assisted by a R-W worker, a BuShips bureaucrat, a Bendix man, and to my
chagrin Ralph Mork of IBM World Trade, who obviously had known more all
along than I had.  The American program effort was run by Alston
Householder, purest soul in numerical analysis, and Arnold Cohen of
Minneapolis, a hardware guy.  And a strange journalist got the publicity
nod, putting DATAMATION's nose out of joint.

<p>

Today I would be upset at being shouldered away from the trough by a horde
of insiders.  In the fall of 1958 I turned aside, secure in my IBM
opportunities and expense account.  If something good got set up, I probably
could go - too late to give a paper, but I would have had trouble satisfying
the U.S. and European purists even if I conformed to the rules and dates.
The exhibits attracted, but I was very dubious about what overseas stuff
could be shown, and two huge Joints a year did the American scene perfectly.

<p>
<a name="[-266-]"><font color="red">[-266-]</font></a>

Then the Cal Tech sky fell in, and early May found me stranded in Sutton
House.  I talked to Elizabeth.  She thought me foolish to expect to find
anything in Europe after my crucifixion, but agreed that there was a big
black crepe bow on the apartment door as far as local jobs were concerned.
We were not too strapped financially, and of course overseas prices were a
long way below Manhattan - ah, 1959!  I said I would fly coach.

<p>

Arrangements went briskly.  It was too late to get space at the cheap
conference hotels, but it was only May, and the flood of Louvre-lovers was
just beginning.  I had stayed at the Grand Hotel near the Opera with
Elizabeth in 1956, and did not want to go there again; that honeymoon
itinerary had been stage-managed by CIT, an Italian travel firm, and most
of their selections had been terrific (La R?serve on the C?te d'Azur,
for instance).  But they had failed in Paris.

<p>

The fancier IBMers stayed at the Ritz, but that seemed a little much for the
unemployed!  I went to de Waldner's favorite, the Lotti, on rue Castiglione
just down the street - but I'm getting ahead of the story.

<p>

I wanted to cock a snoot at hoi Philadelphia polloi, and to have fun
besides.  And it was only the third of my more-than-a-hundred
intercontinental charivaris; the first two had been wonderful because of
Dorothy and Elizabeth, but now I would be solo (perhaps uninhibited is a
better word!).

<p>

I ordered a rental 190SL Mercedes convertible, the precise image of my
Silver Queen of Cincinnati and Phoenix, to be delivered from Frankfurt to
the Geneva airport, and planned to go over the passes to Courmayeur as in
1954, then up to Paris for ICIP [yes, International Conference on
Information Processing: it now had a name, although later most attendees
called it "The 1959 UNESCO Conference"], then over to Cambridge for my first
BCS, British Computer Society, conference, then back to Germany to turn in
the lovely lady.

<p>

"Where will you leave the car while you are in England, sweetie?" asked my
wife.  And I had a lulu of an answer.

<p>

"There is a thing called Silver Cities Airways, dear," I smiled.  "They fly
funny propeller jobbies on which the nose opens up, and three or four cars
get driven aboard, and I sit in a squinched-up cabin behind.  They fly from
a French channel airport to Lydd [LYX], on the south coast.  Doesn't cost
much, since it is only a twenty-minute flight - and I'll have the car in
Cambridge!"

<p>

Actually worked out to be less than a fancy garage in central Paris or at Le
Bourget would cost for a week.  Amazing, those Brits!  The hovercraft killed
it in a few years, and also killed the overnight rail sleeper between Paris
and London - but I managed to ride that too, before it disappeared.

<p>

No doubt Elizabeth was remembering the erotic potential of my original
190SL, but she was confident of her own attractions - and probably looked
forward to stories of any successes I might have!

<p>

I kitted myself out in SCCA [Sports Car Club of America] gear instead of
taking climbing boots, got a new Michelin and a letter of credit - this was
long before the credit card boom, and many of the American attendees at ICIP
had serious problems with cash; when they ran out of travellers' checks they
found AmEx in Paris wouldn't take their Poughkeepsie bank checks!!

<p>

Off I went to Geneva, delayed in Boston by a flat tire [!] on the Pan
American DC7C - turned out they jacked up the plane using a point under the
wing, and I have a slide to prove it.  The envoy from
<a name="[-267-]"><font color="red">[-267-]</font></a>
Frankfurt was still
waiting, however, and delivered a spotless cream-colored 1959 190SL with
black top and leather.  The Silver Queen had been an early 1955.

<p>

The voluminous documentation called it ivory: elfenbein, a lovely word.  It
was wonderful to drive such a beauty again.

<p>

I headed up the lake and the Rh?ne for the Grand St. Bernard, but turned
off up the Val Ferret to inspect Mont Dolent, which I had climbed in 1954
from the Italian side.  The weather had been lovely in Geneva, but turned
mountain-y as I went high.  And as I returned to the main valley and went
south and up the narrow pass road, I began to encounter snow banks up to
three meters deep.

<p>

The path had been laboriously cut through by equipment far less powerful
than what I had seen at work in the Sierras and in Colorado; the high passes
in Europe are simply allowed to close in November, and do not reopen until
June in extreme cases (I was reminded of the Crater Lake rim road in 1948).

<p>

But I was confident, and had checked at the airport; the pass had been
opened for the Giro d'Italia, the greatest bicycle race in Europe after the
Tour de France, which would go through the next day!  It was getting late,
so I passed up the Hospice and its big dogs, and headed down into Italy.

<p>

Aosta did not then have a good hotel, so I headed up the Dora Baltea toward
Courmayeur, but decided against going all the way; it was of course light
until very late, but I was prop-lagged.  So I turned back to the casino
hotel in Saint-Vincent and was welcomed.  They had some overflow business
from the race, said the concierge, who also called ahead for me for the next
night.

<p>

The Royal di Courmayeur, which Dorothy and I had liked so much in 1954, had
opened but was full of press and radio and TV people.  The riders and their
escorts were to be in cheaper quarters the next night (the village was the
terminus for that leg), so every level of housing was working; I got in at
the Hotel Courmayeur. "But have him check in early," my concierge was
advised on the rickety telephone.

<p>

Disregarding the warning, I got up late and took Miss Ivory up a strange
little road to the famous T?te de Champex, from which some of the most
famous photographs of Monte Bianco have been taken.  No one else was there,
and there was snow under the shrubbery; it was early for the Alps.  I took
Kodachromes for Elizabeth and Grace, of the car as well as the mountain (and
of me, using the self-timer and a clamp on the rear-view-mirror mount, as I
had done the year before in the Canadian Rockies).

<p>

It was my first bike race, and I was delighted at everything I saw.  The
food was poor at the hotel, but I was anticipating great things in that
venue later in the trip.  The portions were enormous, having been enlarged
for the corridori, lean little men who ate like wolves, and their coaches,
who were often obese.  The hotel was full of them.

<p>

After the start next morning, as the entourage sped away, I put on heavy
sneakers and drove past Dolonne to the T-junction at the very face of the
mountain, where the marvelous tunnel emerges today.  I wanted to climb -
well, scramble up - a big hill called Mont Chetif which is in the SW armpit
of the T.  On top is a shrine, and each year on the proper feast days the
guides and porters of the village lug heavy batteries up, and that night
light the bulbs in the halo of the Madonna there.  The story is true - or at
least I photographed the bulbs!  And I captured Mont Blanc, especially the
Fauteil des Allemandes, which is perfect from Chetif, and Courmayeur, and
snow bridges to the south tunneled by the Dora torrent.

<p>

I drove out over the Petit St. Bernard, which had no snow problem, and then
around via Breuil-Cervinia
<a name="[-268-]"><font color="red">[-268-]</font></a>
and deserted Sestri?res to Torino.  I could
look out of the high hotel window on a side street and watch locals admiring
the Ivory Lady, parked below with the top still down, but it was from a
cheap room in the Principe di Piemonte, the best hotel in town.  Semi-coach!

<p>

I had lunch next day, pointing out which trout I wanted in the terrace tank,
at a lovely restaurant in a restored medieval village on the bank of the Po
- indeed, beyond it lies Italy!  It was the weekend, so the new Pinin-Farina
factory where custom bodies were put on Alfas and Lancias was closed, but I
drove out and looked in the showroom window anyhow, and thought haughtily my
Lady was more impressive.

<p>

Well, time to think about business.  I turned north, over the Simplon and
its watchful Eagle, and up toward Paris, stopping at Michelin-inspired
hotels and restaurants, and remembering Dorothy and 1954.

<p>

It was the first of many many visits to the Lotti.  The hotel was handsome
in a conservative way, and so was the concierge Josef; Elizabeth would have
approved.  The restaurant was not much; it improved in later years.  But
breakfast, petit d?jeuner in the beautiful room, was just right.  Taking
the ivory princess, who rested in the middle of rue Castiglione at night, so
as to show her to the less fortunate, I drove off to UNESCO headquarters,
which was just a year old.

<p>

Suddenly I was back in the computing world.  Everywhere I looked there were
familiar faces: a hundred Californians, a hundred New Yorkers, and English
and European friends besides.  In the end there were 1800 bods, from 500
Frenchpersons and 400 Americans and 200 West Germans and 170 Brits down to a
lone Mexican, Sergio Beltran.  But many straggled in long after the opening
ceremonies, and there was no grand reception or banquet, as there would be
at the follow-ons in the Sixties and Seventies and Eighties and Nineties.

<p>

Conferences were by now old stuff to the U.S. crew.  The Joints had been
going since 1951; the tenth one had just finished in Los Angeles, with an
attendance of over 4000, and a big exhibit, and lots of Europeans.  But
Paris was something else again, and had drawn a raft of wives and kids. who
were milling around UNESCO with the techies, trying to draw them away to the
museums and the shops.

<p>

This was made easy by the program, which was repellent.  It had read well
back in the U.S., and Great Names were giving papers or running sessions.
But the novelty was in the foreign talks: what was going on in East Germany,
or the USSR?  Japan, where the real action was only beginning, was now being
noticed.  Actually most such information was traded in the UNESCO bars, of
which the Californians were startled to find several (Manhattanites knew
there would be, from the UN Headquarters on First Avenue).

<p>

The honorary chairman was Howard Aiken, who was only mildly irascible but
kept to the Upper Reaches; the French gave him a medal.  The honored vice
chairs were Goto, Lebedev, Peri for France (whom I never heard of before or
since: the earth must have swallowed him), Picone, Santesmases, Wilkes, van
Wijngaarten, and Zuse (an early appearance).  And for the United States,
John Mauchly.

<p>

Session chairs included Andy Booth of Birkbeck, Grace Hopper, Stiefel from
Z?rich (mislabeled as German), Sam Alexander, and the usual painful list
of academics.  Antonin Svoboda, who had gotten back to the U.S. a year or
two before, was still listed as from Czechoslovakia, and there were other
anomalies.  The Europeans gossiped about them, but the Yanks wanted to talk
about time-sharing.  To each other, mostly!

<p>

The opening session was at the Sorbonne, and there was a lot of French.  The
technical sessions back at
<a name="[-269-]"><font color="red">[-269-]</font></a>
Unesco House were mostly in English, sometimes
understandable in spite of the accents and the microphones.  There was
simultaneous translation in the usual UN mode (four languages) but the
technical terms gave much trouble.  In formal international work the booth
ladies usually follow manuscripts - listening for divergences, of course.
Most of us computer types hadn't a clue; only Ike Auerbach was really
experienced, in 1959.  And I only learned in 1967.

<p>

The July/August issue of DATAMATION carried a very good account of the
conference, considering the magazine was only in its third year.  And there
were pictures.  The reporter, Etienne Guerin, refrained from giving the
titles of the papers, and so shall I.

<p>

The exhibits, called AUTO-MATH 59, were terrible, but even so I got first
inklings of the Japanese entry.  You could do a thorough tour in an hour,
versus feeling dizzy after a dozen hours in the JCC halls.

<p>

In his article Guerin concentrated on the birth of IFIP, the new
International Federation of Information Processing, which was to blossom in
1960 after ratification by seven national societies.  That posed a problem,
as the weird Americans had at least three and only the British had another
healthy non-google-eyed one.  Obviously work was needed back at the ranch;
I belonged to the ACM, the IRE and the BCS, but I was tarred with the IBM
brush, so I was not asked to help; word that I had been fired was only just
getting around.

<p>

That word was being spread by a few non-IBM-type IBMers, notably Bob Bemer.
He had brought a tall handsome (but definitely not blushing) bride to the
meeting, scrambling aboard even later than I; the local World Trade people
found the couple a hotel and cashed their Manhattan bank checks, but Bob's
name never did make it into the attendance lists.  I told them about
Generous Electric sending Elizabeth and me on honeymoon to Rome, but the
newlyweds were not impressed.

<p>

The Ivory Queen got to them in spades, however.  They were planning to go on
to the BCS meeting in Cambridge as I was, and were intrigued by my Silver
Cities plans - so much so that Bob rushed out and bought seats on the same
flight, even though he had no car to put aboard.  After the "do" was over
IBM managed to get them out to the airfield (probably a chauffeured car; I
have forgotten).  They watched by my side as an attendant drove the Lady
very carefully up a ramp into the plane, along with two large sedans, and
buttoned up.  We flew.  No drink service!

<p>

At Lydd, which was a barren little WWII strip forty miles south of London,
there were no taxis (naturally!).  The Mercedes trunk was small, and my
luggage filled it, but the right seat was available; I offered to take Bob's
lady in my Lady, "all the way to Cambridge, pal", leaving Bob with their
luggage to make a separate and painful journey.  Alas! the new marriage bond
was too strong.  As I remember it, Bob ordered a taxi from Lydd village and
had it drive them all the way to Cambridge - more than a hundred miles!

<p>

Here I have to go back to a nice Jet Engine adventure.  On Wednesday night
the 17th I was enjoying the Champs-Elys?es when a bunch of senior
Evendale people rushed up and embraced me.  The International Air Show was
on at Le Bourget, and GE had a big exhibit and a hospitality tent (I had
been to several such events in the U.S. and knew what they were talking
about).  Of course I must come out.  Tomorrow?

<p>

Clarice and Gerry Neumann, who had now risen to a department general
managership, welcomed me warmly.  The champagne and bouch?es were
terrific, and I enjoyed the fly-bys, especially the ones by
<a name="[-270-]"><font color="red">[-270-]</font></a>
foreign planes.  It was a spectacular reminder of another world, and Jobless
Grosch was unabashedly wistful.

<p>

Cambridge was as Dorothy and I had seen it five years before, and I was
delighted to meet my English friends, many of whom had not been able to
afford Paris.  I was introduced to Chris Strachey, who had given one of the
few good ICIP papers, but whom I had missed in the scrum.  Sandy Douglas had
come over from Leeds, and we renewed our contact.  He told me that my new
society BCS, then only two years old, was going further afield, planning for
future meetings in Cardiff and Edinburgh.

<p>

There had been a slight commercial flavor to ICIP because of the exhibits,
even though the politicking by Europeans about IFIP-to-come was academic and
governmental.  That flavor had evaporated beside the Cam; the central BCS
figures and many of the speakers were very highbrow indeed.  I turned back
toward the vigorous American scene with relief, although the ACM would never
never match the banquet in King's College!

<p>

The weather had been marvelous ever since I crossed the Saint Bernard, but
as the Mercedes and I steered toward Lydd a light rain began.  The roads
were greasy from the prolonged dry spell, and in Maidstone I slid into the
back of a big Austin sedan and crumpled a headlight and front fender on my
tender lady.  It happened in front of a big garridge, and the whole crew of
mechanics rushed to my - well, her - rescue and pushed the Ivory Lady into
shelter.

<p>

I put up at the rather good local hotel overnight, telephoned to change my
Silver Cities reservation, calling myself every kind of a stupid for my
crime, and waited out the arrival of parts from London (next day by rail!).

<p>

I caught the evening flight, thirty hours behind schedule, and drove all
night through Belgium to make my appointed return date in Frankfurt the next
day.  The agency was devastated at what I had done to their beauty, and
there were forms and forms to fill out.  I had had insurance, but
reimbursement for what I had spent on repairs in England looked almost
impossible.

<p>

I presume I flew back to New York directly from Frankfurt; my memory and my
slide collection are blank.  All I can remember is how my wounded Lady
looked as I said a regretful farewell!

<p>

I really love an apposite quotation, and this chapter title, as you will see,
is an absolute marvel.  True, Shakespeare said "sun of York", but my slight
improvement fits the circumstances.

<p>

The winter of my discontent was 1959.  The Wild Duck of Chapters 23 and 24 was
having a hard time settling on his next pond.  Word of the imbroglio at Cal
Tech, amplified at least on the West Coast by regrets over Ridenour's untimely
death, spread rapidly; my attempts to tell what had really happened, aided by
friends and by DuBridge, did very poorly.  I was used to benefiting by what
today is called media coverage; now I found out in 1959 how hard it was to
alter the results of that coverage after interest had dwindled.  I told my
story in Paris and Cambridge, but that was a specialized audience.

<p>

I got back from the ICIP/BCS trip a little depressed, and crunching the pretty
Mercedes was only a part of it.  I had not hit on possible employment either
overseas or back in the U.S. at either meeting, and I had spent a small
fortune restoring my IBM-damaged ego.  While Elizabeth and Grace were careful
not to criticize, they had to be dubious about my careening around places like
Courmayeur while I had no income at home.  I set to work.

<p>

After I had answered a few fancy employment ads and followed up suggestions
from friends about places that needed Chief Information Officers [ah there,
Harold Smiddy!], I realized I was sort of in Coventry.  Most big user
organizations were tied enthusiastically or reluctantly to The Grim Gray
Giant, as I had christened IBM a year or two before, and felt they depended on
favors from Vin Learson and his boys.  If a company really needed me they
might take a chance, but I hadn't hit one of those.

<p>

I tried hardware outfits, not as a creative type but as a proven expert
manager of (or extractor-of-results-from) creative types.  I remember
interviews for the general managership of a Stromberg Carlson subsidiary in
San Diego which made an interesting Charactron-based high speed printer, and
where my adventures at Cal Tech had never been heard of.  But such outfits
seemed to be thin on the ground.

<p>

In the early years of the decade several previously valued senior members of
the computer fraternity had been skewered by McCarthyism and the suspicions of
the times.  Nothing like the Hollywood witchhunts, of course; for one thing,
there were no uglies upstairs in the trade using Washington antiliberalism
against old enemies.

<p>

Los Alamos was completely in the grip of security freaks (who of course had
failed to apprehend or even suspect real spies like Klaus Fuchs, and were
revenging themselves on Oppie And Co.).  So Stan Frankel was treated badly.
But when Dick Clippinger was under shadow, his new bosses at Raytheon did
quite well by him - no MGM beastliness.

<p>

Observing this from Ohio in 1955, I noted some unhappy exiles had survived by
becoming consultants; Frankel had completely disappeared, but was busily
designing powerful small machines down in a basement somewhere.  So we didn't
see him at the Joints?  Big deal!

<p>

I printed up a rate card and declared myself a consultant.  For the obvious
reason that I knew where a lot of problems were buried, I tried GE early on,
and even struck a little pay dirt at IBM later.  At GE, bypassing Phoenix as
not yet having buried its problems, let alone wanting them disinterred, I
talked to Bob Johnson in Palo Alto.  He put me to work listing research areas
where I thought the big laboratories in Schenectady, and his SRI connections
in Palo Alto, and (in the hopefully near future) his own bailiwick, might
produce developable payoffs.

<p>

I drew on my knowledge of Poughkeepsie and Kingston IBM projects; Yorktown
Heights was barely underway, and the 115th Street enlargement of the Watson
Lab was working too far out in physics and chemistry and metallurgy to look
promising.  Bob tucked away my recommendations, paid me promptly with Phoenix
money, and waved me off.

<p>

As consultants must the world over, I called on friends who were also trying
to sell advice or offer personal services.  One of these was a Good Eater
named Paul Brock.  He had been a major technical manager at Electrodata before
the Burroughs rapprochement, along with a great gal named Sybil Rock.  Paul
had been brought into the company by Clifford Berry, who was an early chief
engineer of the predecessor company and had before that been an associate of
Atanasoff (although the latter's name was not familiar to me in 1959).

<p>

Paul had met Cliff through Purdue, and years later returned to that university
when the exigencies of consulting palled.  But in 1959 he had just started on
his own, working out of his Pasadena house.  I told him my side of the Cal
Tech incident at the EJCC in Boston just before Christmas, ending with the
Wild Duck memo, and his big belly shook as he laughed at me and with me: a
good friend.

<p>

Soon he had introduced me to his newest client, C-E-I-R.  This was the new
corporate name of what had been the non-profit Council for Economic and
Industrial Research, now the brainchild of one Herbert W.  Robinson - the
Yorkshireman of this chapter's title.  Robbie was an inside-the-Beltway type,
and the Council had been suckling on one of the thousand federal teats.  He
wanted not to wean it, Heaven forfend! but to add richer commercial fodder,
and Paul was introducing him to potential customers, relying on Electrodata
experiences.

<p>

The Son Of York was a remarkable fellow.  In spite of his
businessman/entrepreneur posture and appearance, he had good doctorates from
LSE, the London School of Economics, and from Oxford (Balliol).  He had worked
for Lord Cherwell, who was Churchill's scientific advisor, mostly by using the
new mathematics of operations (Brits said "operational") research to allocate
scarce resources.  He had served on at least one mission in Washington and,
correctly judging the relative postwar strengths of Britain and the U.S., had
immigrated in 1943.

<p>

He worked in international outfits where citizenship was not a requirement,
got his U.S. papers in 1948, and did a hitch in Defense.  He tripped over a
project to computerize reports of nuclear warfare damage from a network of
sensors and such - or a proposed network, maybe.  It was super-Top-Secret [for
no good reason, seen from 1998; antisabotage precautions would be needed only
much later in the game, and even then only at the Secret level], and out of
the main stream.  I don't think Benton's boys in IBM's Military Products
Division had ever heard of it.

<p>

The Council had been founded for and was working on a big input-output
analysis job for the Air Force.  Robbie dug into his savings and bought
control, rented an IBM 650 - which was needed for the OR stuff anyhow - and
got the secret job.  He hired Bill Orchard-Hays away from RAND, and picked off
Jack Moshman, who had done the model for the notorious television [UNIVAC]
election prediction.  Fantastic!

<p>

Robbie had two great advantages.  First, he didn't know beans about computing
or computers, so he could promise anything his clients wanted with a straight
face.  Second, there was no way the Post-Bang Boys could realistically test
the resulting software.  The SAGE people knew all about that but were off in
another Pentagon universe (call it No-Bang).  The customer was perforce
delighted.

<p>

By the time Paul introduced me to Robbie all this had settled down.  I was of
course not to intrude on Paul's territory, although in his generous way he had
told me I could offer overseas contacts he didn't have; remarkable!  What he
emphasized at the first meeting, in C-E-I-R's dull Arlington quarters in the
early fall, was my unusual experience at running big charge-back shared
operations on major IBM machinery.

<p>

Robbie first sent me off to look at a cooperative 709 he was sharing with
Union Carbide at their Manhattan headquarters, a short mention of which had
appeared in the burgeoning DATAMATION.  I reported it was being clumsily run
by both partners but that no major fixes were needed.  The relationship
prospered, although I adjusted to Yorkshireman tightfistedness with
reluctance, fending off criticism of my restaurant charges with accounts of
glamorous exploits for IBM and GE, and dangling my Brits and Europeans.

<p>

It soon came out that Robbie hungered for a presence on the English scene,
where his image as a boffin and as a grinding academic could be submerged in
C-E-I-R glamor.  I volunteered to find him a point man, and set out gaily for
London and the Savoy.  Later I'll do the English user and manufacturer scenes
as I reported them for Control Data in 1962; this was a much narrower task.

<p>

My first candidate was Leslie Fox, who had gone up to Oxford from Goodwin's
group at NPL to start computer courses and to run an early Ferranti machine
supplied by the UGC, University Grants Committee.  I worked on him over the
best the Savoy Grill had to offer: took him up on a high hill and showed him
the kingdoms of British computer service.  Not a chance, he said, reminding me
of the sports fields of Oxford and the delights of research (he was an Oxford
Blue and a creative numerical analyst, in that order).

<p>

My third choice was the powerful system designer Chris Strachey I had met at
the BCS, who was involved with Ferranti plans for the ATLAS, competitor with
LARC and STRETCH in the supercomputer steeplechase, and had given one of the
few significant papers at ICIP.  When I talked to him on the phone he made me
tell him what I was after, and turned me down flat without even letting me buy
a drink.  He wanted to build new machines, not run old ones.  "I had my fill
of that after the war," he grumped.  And I had heard how good he was at
logical design, from Goodwin and Wilkie and especially Stan Gill; it was hard
to argue.

<p>

I was shipping in my second choice next day, and had my fingers crossed; my
fourth choice was Gill, and I was pretty sure he loved the Cambridge ambience
as Fox loved Oxford's.  But it turned out Sandy Douglas, who came down from
Leeds, was enthusiastic from the start.  He wanted to make his fortune as
strongly as Robbie, but was less willing to give up the intellectual world; he
was a founding member of the new British Computer Society (which Robbie didn't
give a fig for).  I did, and had joined in 1958.

<p>

As a consultant, I wasn't empowered to make him an offer, nor even to describe
C-E-I-R British plans.  "They'll revolve around you and your experience and
your contacts, Sandy," I said.  "Robbie is an opportunist; he'll use what you
do best, not force you into an IBM blue suit or make you shave your moustache.
I'll ship him over."

<p>

I didn't want Douglas to see the messy headquarters or scent the marginal
finances.  On the other hand, he knew Orchard-Hays and Moshman, and was
impressed.  Also I had already guessed that my client wanted to "do" England
[on business], perhaps with his American wife!

<p>

Robbie came over, hired Sandy with some sort of stock option, set him up close
to the Kingsway IBM offices, and in the end did fairly well with the London
enterprise.  Years later the two of them got in bed with BP, British
Petroleum, and turned the English branch into a separate stock company.  This
evolved into what was later known as Scicon, and Sandy got enough out of the
deals to buy a house up-Thames with a tennis court.

<p>

I left the two hungries to work it out, and took off.  I had an elaborate plan
under way, which involved my first visit to Zermatt and the Matterhorn,
followed by a major airline adventure.  To further the former, I had brought
my then-unusual Head skis, my Molitor boots, and the parka and so on from
Squaw, and they were standing in my Embankment-side room in the Savoy.

<p>

My first-class airline ticket continued on to Geneva/Paris/New York; I
intended to pay the European parts myself.  I had a single room reserved at
the Zermatterhof, arranged by Swissair back at Rockefeller Center.  And most
of all, I had a request in, via the fancy Air France office in Manhattan, for
space on the inaugural 707 flight from Orly to Idlewild, which Aviation Week
and my old PR buddies in Evendale said was laid on for the last day of January
[1960].

<p>

There were to be honored VIP guests, of course, but the whole plane was being
specially set up for first class - it was designated AF0707 - so there was a
good deal of space left over even after the big shots and the press were
accommodated.  I had picked up the date months before, but without my old
Evendale connections was not much more than an ordinary New York customer.  I
had written several letters on my engraved Sutton House stationery and
mentioned I was an AA Admiral (1954) and a TW Ambassador (1955) and a
honeymoon berth-rider on the SAS Transpolar (1956), but had had only a very
cool form letter in response.

<p>

The Swissair plane on Friday was a dumb little Convair just like the ones I
had flown a hundred times out of Cincinnati.  I shared a seat with a handsome
chap who turned out also to be going to Zermatt.  He was a Swissair executive
who was invited to the weekend wedding of one of the Seilers, the family which
owned most of the fancier Zermatt hotels, and was pleased to be able to borrow
the Thomas Cook rail schedules book which I had purchased in London.  I had
already chosen the trains to get me to Brig and onto the narrow-gauge to
Zermatt, and was literally quivering with excitement (he was of course a very
old hand, not a railroad buff, and somewhat amused at my boyishness).

<p>

Then things began to go wrong.  The pilot came on the blower and announced
that Geneva was fogged in, and that we would divert, not to Zurich, but to the
small airport at Basel.  Even my seatmate was upset.  We pored over my Cook
and decided it might just be possible to catch an express from someplace
[probably Chur; I no longer remember] that would connect to the last train out
of Brig.  But there did not seem to be a way of connecting via the Basel
station, especially as the trip in to town was made difficult by the
three-countries airport location.

<p>

By this time we were on the ground and baggage was coming off, including my
skis.  We had picked up a rich Englishman who also wanted to look at my Cook,
and also wanted to move fast - he had a date in Geneva.  We used his money, my
timetables, and my Swissair friend's airport savvy to get a private car (the
taxis were all taken), and off we went.  We just barely made the train at some
place or other, with all our duffle.  We had a jolly dinner on board, the two
of us got off in Brig, and the "milord", as my Swiss laughingly called him,
went on to Geneva.

<p>

I had a wonderful time up topside, took lots of Kodachromes - still have one
of Mr. Swissair sunning himself on the Riffelberg at lunch the next week - and
learned a little about the village.  The Zermatterhof was terrific.  Then
excitement: Air France in Geneva came on the telephone and said I had been
"allotted space" on the inaugural Sunday, and that they had booked me on one
of their Caravelle flights to Paris to connect.  Trouble was, I would have to
go into Geneva the night before to get it, spoiling a whole day of my
expensive ski excursion.  And since I was on a weekly rate at the Zermatt
hotel, I was looking at an extra overnight in expensive Geneva besides.

<p>

I huddled with the wonderful Zermatterhof manager.  There was a glacier pilot
named Geiger, he said, who frequently landed on the Riffelberg slopes up above
the village, and who would fly me direct to the Geneva airport.  And circle
the Matterhorn besides!!  It wasn't cheap, but wow!

<p>

Sunday morning very early, wearing city clothes but in after-ski boots, I took
the first Gornergrat train up, got off at the Riffelberg stop (no skiers yet -
too early) and found a tiny Aeronca waiting nearby, on skis which had small
wheels poking through for non-snow landings.  The takeoff was terrifying,
since it involved a fairly steep downward slope and an irreversible drop-off,
but the pilot said he did it many times each month.  OOOGH!  we made it.

<p>

Nobody seemed to be impressed in Geneva; flying in from the Matterhorn was a
regular thing.  I remember asking the pilot, a nice youngster named
Martinelli, whether he could handle another passenger, thinking of how
Elizabeth would thrill at the idea.  No, he said, one live passenger was his
limit - but two corpses were OK (Geiger did a lot of mountain rescue work,
much of it really really dangerous).

<p>

At Orly there was an Air France chap at the foot of the Caravelle steps for
me, and my skis and baggage were transferred directly to the big jet across
the way.  What a thrill!

<p>

I had only an aisle seat, but my 707 seatmate turned out to be the Air France
chief of cabin service, so we got even more attention than the other VIPs.  I
told him about my morning flight out of Zermatt, which made him blink, and got
his card, which I used up and down Air France for several years.  The food and
service were fantastic - extra staff, of course - and the Laurent Perrier
Grand Si?cle champagne flowed and flowed.

<p>

And Elizabeth met the plane, looking magnificent in her mink stole, and
excited by my Zermatt stories and my Alpine ski tan.  Quel aventure!!

<p>

Meanwhile back at the Arlington ranch Robbie continued to wheel and deal.  As
I had taken Fox and Douglas up on a high hill and showed them not-very-distant
fortunes, so he worked on me to come over from consultancy (and a high per
diem, which he hated to pay) to a senior salaried job with a fancy title and a
sizable stock option.

<p>

I should have refused; I didn't want to Give Up Everything For Gold, and
Herbert W. looked like trouble.  But it was a high hill he took me up, and I
remembered painfully how I had regretted Cuthbert Hurd not doing the same.
Robbie saw computer services as a way to make millions; I saw them as a way
into the future, and toward power and excitement and very good living - those
Watsonian perks The Old Man had generated.  And more trips to Zermatt.  I said
yes.

<p>

But I distrusted Robbie.  You could tell in your first few words with him he
would sell anybody's birthright for a mess of pottage, and scrooge around
while the pottage was on the boil.  So I inserted a clause in the agreement
giving me a pro rata chunk of the promised stock package if the relationship
was terminated before the option matured.

<p>

Well!  What we both wanted to do was to combine my very special knowledge of
the IBM STRETCH program, my familiarity with the large-computer operations
environment, my contacts in the Southern California tin airplane business, and
my demonstrated persuasiveness, with the C-E-I-R willingness to promise
anything, anything, anything.

<p>

"Don't spend a penny you don't have to," was Robbie's first command.  So
instead of setting up an office on Wilshire and hiring a couple of beautiful
secretaries, I rented a motel room in Sunset Tower West, within walking
distance of ten good restaurants, and put in a private phone line.

<p>

I breakfasted most mornings at Schwab's, which was only two blocks east (I was
in the heart of the dollie belt, between Chateau Marmont and Scandia).
Elizabeth, confident of her attractions [and rightly so] gave me carte
blanche.  "When you have sex with some of those Hollywood beauties," she said,
"I want to hear the details.  If they do anything you particularly like ... "
What a woman!

<p>

One of the few loose ends in a rather tight expense-account package at C-E-I-R
headquarters was a generous mileage rate for use of your own car (probably
because Robbie drove a big Cadillac).  I instantly made a down payment on a
magnificent scarlet Alfa Romeo Spyder.  The radio and other electrics were
dreadful, but oh! that engine - and I bought an imitation-Herm?s head scarf
to keep in the glove compartment for "Hollywood beauties" to put on while I
had the top down!

<p>

Just right for me, that little car was.  John Lowe drove a horrid old old
Buick to accommodate his wooden leg; Jack Strong had a Caddie a lot sexier
than Robbie's; Cecil Hastings had a bicycle!  The outfit I bought the Alfa
from, Hoffman Motors, had its main office in Manhattan; I dealt with them,
which made the monthly payment thing simpler and provided New York plates
against the Sutton House address (and let me avoid sales taxes in both
states).  A salesman on Wilshire got the commission, so I got good service;
the whole concept of working "in the cracks" became familiar in later years,
when I was a full expat!

<p>

I settled in to writing a series of fairly fat proposals, ninety percent
boilerplate but ostensibly tailored to RAND, three Douglases, two Lockheeds,
North American, Hughes and so on.  Each one offered a cooperative arrangement
to install and operate a major STRETCH system in the LA area, with C-E-I-R
taking a third of a shift to resell to smaller clients and four partners
buying a sixth of a shift each.

<p>

I specified simple arrangements to expand a partner's utilization and of
course reduce the per-hour cost, and offered on the other hand to resell on
commission any unused time from the guaranteed share.  I specified how the
number of partners could be increased or decreased.  I proposed to expand to a
second smaller system after two shifts on the first machine were solid.  I
gave a list of components for each system, with capabilities and probable
costs - data not available from IBM, which was constrained by the 1956 consent
decree, even though announcement was imminent.

<p>

It reads well even today; it was free of legalisms, spoke frankly of trust
between the partners instead.  It reflected deep experience on my own part and
on the part of every proposed partner in operation of big computers.  Wasn't
anything like the document Union Carbide and C-E-I-R had signed for New York.
And, much to Robbie's dismay, it listed the possible partners to whom the
proposals were directed.

<p>

I had his consent to put out a "preliminary proposal" to generate partner
comments, and had STRETCHed that permission to the limit.  I knew that if the
seniors back in Arlington, and the lawyer and the finance guy, and Robbie
himself, once started improving the script, I'd be stuck in Sunset Towers
until IBM not only announced, but some competitor like SDC or even IBM itself
made a similar offer.  I used that argument to get a reluctant OK, but of
course Robbie expected something itsie-bitsie, not this forthright document.

<p>

I hand-delivered three copies to the computer big shot at each location: I
knew each one, was liked by some (Lowe, Strong, Armer) and respected by almost
all.  I expected a copy would find its way immediately to the local IBM office
via Cuthbert Hurd's Applied Science people, and blandly mailed a request to
the LA office on D-day (my birthday, 13 September 1960) for "a senior sales
rep and one of Hurd's gang" to call on me as soon as possible and "get
discussion going on a probable C-E-I-R order for an early STRETCH".  Hmmmm!

<p>

My phone rang off the hook for a day or two; most of the recipients knew what
I was working on, but even Lowe had not known details, or what I proposed to
charge.  Then silence, as the document worked its way upstairs in the various
organizations.

<p>

It got topside fastest in IBM, needless to say, and a stiff-backed local
management type (in a sport jacket, however, which was a nice touch) came out
to read me the riot act.  He was icily not amused when I suggested that the
Service Bureau Corporation might well want to compete "as they tried to do in
Huntsville" - cruel, cruel!  "Perfectly all right with C-E-I-R, George," I
said, "but remember this meeting establishes our right to a machine ahead of
SBC, or I'll stir up a Consent Decree stink you wouldn't believe!"

<p>

While we wait for the denouement, two stories: one starting with Paul Brock,
one about Robbie.  Paul introduced me to his favorite lunch place, which was
walking distance west of me (but too far for Paul!), the famous Cock `N Bull.
Lots of movie types, and the best barbecued beef bones on the West Coast (or
so Paul said).  I opened a charge account, and wondered if I should wear an
ascot. Driving up in the Alfa helped a lot too.

<p>

The Right Drink was Pim's #1 Cup, with a cucumber stick.  Filling up the big
pewter mug with Cock `N Bull ginger beer was what had given the place its
cachet.  And even Jack Strong was impressed by the women.

<p>

Early in my stay Robbie flew out.  His plane was rerouted to San Berdoo, but I
was alerted, so I drove out to save him the ugliness of a cheap airport bus.
He did not, repeat not, like the Alfa - even with the top up.  But I told him
it was cheaper to operate than his Cadillac, and much easier to park.

<p>

Turned out he was not inspecting Sunset Tower West.  He had had a long,
strange telephone conversation with the CEO of a Los Angeles firm that wanted
to either buy out or at least to take a major position in C-E-I-R.  I have to
beg pardon for having forgotten names and details; in all my papers I have
found no trace of this peculiar visit.  I remember that the company involved
was the one that had taken over, and later dumped, the hardware part of the
Beeman/Bell Telecomputing Corporation when it was broken up, largely because
they valued the name.

<p>

I tagged along with Robbie, mostly to provide cheap transportation - LA taxi
rates were unbelievable.  We ended up in a lavish Beverly Hills mansion with
three hard-eyed entrepreneurs who seemed to know the C-E-I-R balance sheet as
well as Robbie, and two luscious wenches who served drinks and generally
decorated the place.  Robbie was repelled by the whole thing; much as I was
later to dislike him, his original sturdy Yorkshire morality and LSE/Oxford
intelligence surfaced frequently, and this was one of the times.

<p>

The weekend was coming up.  "I have a place in Palm Springs," said Hard-Eyes
Number One.  "Let's move out there and do this more informally around the
pool."  Robbie muttered some pathetic story about having commitments in
Virginia, and we scrambled out.  I was bursting.

<p>

"Herb, what were those two women there for?" asked Robbie plaintively as we
Alfa-ed off to his cheap motel.  "The blonde was for you, you lucky boy!" I
laughed.  "You could have ravaged her all weekend, while Old Hard-Eyes was
rowelling his brunette and going through your wallet."  He thought I was
kidding!

<p>

If they had had the foresight, or the generosity, to provide a redhead for me,
I would have persuaded my dear boss to at least go out into the desert and put
on borrowed bathing trunks, and maybe even get laid.  But no Yorkshireman
would sell his company to Hard-Eyeses for nookie.  A Saskatchewan, maybe; it
would have to be prime, prime nookie!  I'll never know.

<p>

Two things came together suddenly: IBM made formal announcement of STRETCH;
the story was carried in the May/June [1960] DATAMATION.  And I began to get
turndowns from my submissions.  Most of the latter were not connected to the
IBM story; for instance, Paul Armer's boss at RAND wrote me a scathing letter
saying that if my idea of a cooperative was sound, RAND or SDC would be far
better placed to sponsor it than this dubious outfit I seemed to be associated
with (I took this to mean "no"!).

<p>

But one or two were connected.  I got a plaintive call from my friend John
Lowe at Douglas Santa Monica pointing out that the official IBM performance
figures were a good deal less impressive than my estimates, mostly due to the
non-announcement of the freon-cooled rapid memory, and the prices were
somewhat higher.  I had discovered this already via Applied Science friends
who had sneaked me a same-day copy of The Grand Announcement, and I had called
C-E-I-R with the news.

<p>

Over the next two weeks I checked out the full list, many of which probably
would never have written me their refusal.  I had expressions of interest from
a subterranean at Hughes named something like Mayhew, who a couple of years
later turned out to be a very important skulldugger for Reclusive Howard, and
from Jack Strong and Frank Wagner at North American Inglewood, and a "keep us
informed" from Northrop.  Not enough, I told Robbie.

<p>

As Director of Corporate Planning or some such - I really thought of myself as
C-E-I-R Flexible Ambassador To Aerospace - I knew Robbie was well into a
public stock offering, and had even been shown drafts of the prospectus, now
in a delicate stage.  The UK office and the Union Carbide shared installation
were carefully described, a new venture underway involving Orchard-Hays but
not me was mentioned, and the intention to "explore" a STRETCH was very
briefly referred to, with appropriate cautionary words about its probable high
cost.

<p>

What I could not know `way out on Sunset Boulevard was that Arlington was in a
wild tizzy over the offering.  It was many years later that hi-tech outfits
and venture capitalists and underwriting firms "did" several such affairs a
month; it was all new in 1960, and not only Robbie but all his stock-option
seniors were expecting to turn some of their holdings into Real Money if all
went well.

<p>

And here was this bearded loose cannon, Call-A-Spade-A-Bloody-Shovel Grosch,
telling his prospect list C-E-I-R would have to rework its STRETCH proposal.
No, no, nooo!!

<p>

Picture me standing under the open stairway in the lobby of the Jack Tar in
San Francisco [but I was staying at the Clift!], holding forth to a small
skeptical audience about the AFIPS conference we were all attending, and why
IBM was being so close-mouthed about STRETCH.  Two formal types, obviously not
computernicks, came up to me and asked if I was "Doctor Herbert Grosch".  I
should have said, "Who wants to know?" I suppose, but instead I said a brisk
yes.

<p>

And they served me with papers.  First, a formal dismissal notice from Robbie,
to take effect at the close of business in California that very day - about an
hour ago, in fact; second, a demand that I turn over all C-E-I-R papers and
property to a named lawyer on Wilshire in Los Angeles "forthwith", at which
time a severance check would be delivered; third, a temporary injunction
granted by a San Francisco [!!] judge prohibiting me from discussing any and
all C-E-I-R affairs with third parties, and calling on me to appear in his
court with counsel, also "forthwith", if the injunction was not to be rendered
permanent.  Jeeezus!

<p>

I was too cynical about Lawyer Scam to rush out and hire somebody right away.
Instead I did the unorthodox: went over the next morning to see the judge who
had issued the injunction, told him that all the papers (and all the people
Robbie wanted me not to talk to) were elsewhere, and that I was removing
myself from his jurisdiction, ahem, "forthwith" - mentioning Sydney and Tokyo
but not Papeete.  He agreed pleasantly [this was San Francisco, not LA or DC
or NYC] that the matter appeared moot.  We shook hands, and I drove
immediately to the airport.

<p>

If I were doing this part of the book in chronological order, as editors and
reviewers and friends have urged, I would now embark for Tahiti.  Really!!
Instead, I'll finish with The Son Of York and his minions.

<p>

I had a speech engagement elsewhere, and the travel involved gave me time to
figure what to do.  I already had tickets for the adventures to be described
in the next chapter, and there was several days idle time in Los Angeles that
I had planned to use to call on potential STRETCH users (not including Mr.
Hoity-Toity at RAND!).

<p>

I used them instead to close out the Sunset Tower apartment and telephone,
store a carton of C-E-I-R papers and records, go ahead with the previously
arranged garaging of my pretty red Alfa, and set up an appointment with
Robbie's Wilshire lawyer.

<p>

I asked him if he knew of the option agreement, and he said it was not
mentioned in the papers that had been sent him (in other words, he was just an
extension of a Nest Of Vipers in D.C. or Arlington).  He tried to be coy about
the severance check, but in the end admitted it was "salary due you" up to the
moment of dismissal: Yorkshiremen did not do Golden Handshakes.

<p>

Telling him that I had carefully stored away "all C-E-I-R documents" on my own
time and at my own expense, I bid him goodbye.  The check? he said.  "Send it
back," I smiled.  "There will be a lot more haggling when I get back from
Australia.  Be sure to tell Robbie I mentioned the option agreement."  And I
drove away to the airport [rental car].

<p>

Six weeks later, when I flew into Idlewild from Europe [yes, Europe!],
Elizabeth was horny, amused, and bemused, in that order.  She reported
numerous anguished phone calls from secretaries (a big mistake, with
Elizabeth), lawyers, C-E-I-R executives - but not The Son Of York.  "Let it
sizzle, chickadee," I laughed.  "Meanwhile, let me show you the Thai silks I
brought you, and the jewelry."

<p>

In play were the following elements: papers in Los Angeles [trivial, but the
lawyers didn't know that], my knowledge of the California possibilities for
C-E-I-R, ditto for Australia, severance pay, the option agreement, a
round-the-world first class air ticket charged to Arlington, and expenses in
California and Sydney recently billed.  In the wings were another troupe of
actors, waiting for me to start a Cleveland facilities-management company
related to my Huntsville success.  And, very very reluctantly, I had hired a
lawyer.  Complicated!

<p>

My lawyer called their lawyer and said I was "back from Australia and Japan".
I presume they grappled.  There is to be a meeting in New York, my guy told
me.  No hurry, I said.

<p>

As I expected, Robbie himself did not come; in fact, I didn't see him again
for over twenty years, after he had made his pile.  A lawyer and the C-E-I-R
finance man showed up.  Grumpily!  I reminded them that serving papers on me
without warning - and in the Jack Tar, for God's sake - did not precisely fit
the image they wanted to display in the underwriting, or in Los Angeles.

<p>

The C-E-I-R lawyer talked about the injunction.  Never made permanent, I
replied.  I also seem to remember telling him in scatological frankness what
he could do with his injunctions, and that I would send a copy of the next one
to the SEC the day it was served.  Shush, my lawyer said.

<p>

The beancounter produced a list of disallowed expense (not just the glorious
Air France ticket, either).  My lawyer countered with a demand for salary due
and three months severance pay in lieu of "customary notice" and mental
anguish.  Pretty!

<p>

He then produced the employment agreement, much to the finance man's disgust,
and claimed 523 shares of C-E-I-R stock, based on my [short] length of service
versus the five-year option payoff.  The phrasing in the contract was clear,
the message, unacceptable to Robbie, who had most of the stock.

<p>

We threatened to bring suit (with copy to the SEC, I laughed).  The lawyers
said the finance man and I were disturbing influences and chased us out for
their conference.  In the event, C-E-I-R agreed to hand over the stock,
provided I understood it could not be sold or transferred for one year [or
maybe longer; I find no trace in my papers].  They agreed to swallow all the
disputed expenses except the Big Ticket, and to pay salary plus one month's
severance pay.

<p>

I had tried to get my lawyer to bargain for his fee, but he said it was
unethical.  I told him I wanted his skills, not his ethics. Failed on that
one!

<p>

There was a nice upshot.  I mentioned above that I was being urged to start a
facilities-management outfit.  When incorporation was complete, and I had been
elected president, I sold Robbie's precious 523 shares, making nearly ten
thousand bucks on the deal.  When the C-E-I-R troops descended on me en masse,
I pointed out that there was no prohibition on my working for a competitor, or
starting one, and that conflict of interest required me to not hold C-E-I-R
stock while doing so.

<p>

And I paid my lawyer.  He was not happy with me, and said Robbie would
undoubtedly sue.  I'll need you again if he does, I replied.

<p>

After the STRETCH announcement settled in, the Wall Street Journal reported
that Robbie had rented two of the monsters, and had hired my good friend Jack
Strong to run one on Wilshire Boulevard.  I called him instantly and warned
him about Robbie, but it was too late.  When I went out to Los Angeles to
retrieve the little Alfa, Jack had signed with a building manager, and the
C-E-I-R logo had gone on up topside.

<p>

In the end IBM installed only four or five machines, now called 7030s, in the
U.S.  They put one into the AEE in England.  And, anxious not to make or
service any more, they released C-E-I-R from its contract.  Jack put in a 7094
on Wilshire, but I never saw it; I was living in Monaco.

<p>

To the best of my knowledge, none of Robbie's senior employees made a buck out
of their options for years; the stock dropped like a stone not long after I
sold mine, leaving Orchard-Hays and Moshman and still-my-friend Strong, and
the founding nontechies, unenriched.

<p>

The literature has carried some of the story of the STRETCH disaster,
including a little of Red Dunwell's story.  DATAMATION was the only trade
journal to cover the story as it happened, and anecdotally, but later
publications filled in.  Probably the weirdest yarns were on p.18 of the
September/October DMN issue, which said C-E-I-R would pay $300,000 a month for
one 7030 (the second was not mentioned), that Robbie had bought out General
Analysis Corporation to get programmers to staff it, and that RAND had been
considering copying my cooperative idea but had backed off!!

<p>

An associated story signed by Bill Orchard-Hays said programming was an
"Important Key To STRETCH Future", which I took to mean he had spare bodies in
his new Houston shop.

<p>

I really never heard much more of the huge debacle than was published.  The
official IBM position was "Grosch?  Never heard of him", and the techies who
were not bound by Galactic Headquarters strictures either didn't know much
(the details were narrowly held) or regarded me as one of the causes -
remember Baby STRETCH, and the ambitions of Fred Brooks and Werner Buchholz
and all, killed by the 7090 concept?  The late Cuthbert Hurd probably could
have told the whole story.  And some of Tom Junior's unhappiness surfaced in
his autobiography decades later.

<p>

One cause was the failure of the freon-cooled ultrafast scratch-pad memory.
Another was that look-ahead, which has been incorporated in current fancy
chippery, doesn't do as much for most applications as the 7030 architects had
hoped.  And announcement was six months delayed.

<p>

Big problem, I'd guess, was that LARC, the RemRand rival supercomputer, could
be seen by Watson Junior and his Golden Boys to be a complete failure, so the
urgency to finish and publicize and sell the unhappy 7030 was much reduced.
Obviously IBM lost money on each one, as they had on the 701s, and with LARC
dead in the water there was beancounter dissent.  Watson Senior said "go" on
the 700 series, but even he might have passed on STRETCH.

<hr>
<p>

While playing games for C-E-I-R on Sunset Boulevard, and eating delicious beef
bones down the street, and ogling the wannabees at Schwab's, I had been
preparing for a magnificent new adventure.

<p>

There were multiple threads, not all computer-connected.  Two that were,
dominated.  The Bennett Boys were about to hold their very first ANCCAC,
Australian Conference on Computers and Automatic Control, in Sydney.  I had
known John Bennett since his long stay in Champaign, and we are still friends
today.  He invited me to chair one of the user sessions, offering only a
complimentary registration but referring obliquely to my "new" C-E-I-R
connection [computer trade gossip crossed even the Pacific and the equator,
probably via DATAMATION].

<p>

I knew enough about the Australian enthusiasms, and about Robbie's desire to
fly high among overseas English-speakers, to propose to him that he consider
setting up in Sydney as he had in London.  Exaggerating my acquaintanceships,
I promised him to turn up another Sandy Douglas.  He didn't want to pay for
such expensive prospecting, but told me to keep Bennett's offer on the front
burner.  In true Groschian fashion, I took that to mean "go, boy, go!".

<p>

The second thread was that I had been following the very small trickles of
news coming out of Japan.  I had exchanged letters with Eiichi Goto, who was
still at Tokyo University doing componentry, and I knew a little about how the
famous Dr. Ikeda was transforming Fujitsu from a communications outfit.  I
knew IBM was dominant among the very very few solidly American firms operating
in Japan.  And I had written down a name or two from the Electrotechnical Lab,
which was a cross - in those days, a miniature cross - between the Bell Labs
and Sam Alexander's NBS.

<p>

Wasn't much, but most Americans in computing had no interest or knowledge at
all about the coming Japanese explosion.  My IBM information was seminal - and
besides, I remembered those unexpectedly original Japanese aircraft gunsights
back in 1942!

<p>

Also I had seen the equipment from four Japanese companies at AUTO-MATH 59 at
the Paris ICIP meeting: Fuji, Hitachi, Nippon Electric [today's NEC], and Oki.

<p>

Scenting new business for American enterprises, as I later did in Europe when
I did my ITT investigation [which I haven't gotten to yet: patience!], I
thought it feasible to pay the extra air fare myself to return via Japan.  If
nothing else, I could write it off on the income tax (not that my bracket was
all that high!)  And it was not a lot of money, assuming Robbie did the Sydney
ticket.

<p>

Now the non-computer excitement began to mount.  Looking at the seductive
route maps in the back of the Official Airline Guide, I began to list
stopovers [no extra charge for first class passengers; this was decades before
crazy fare wars and special tour tickets]: Darwin, Djakarta, Saigon for the
Angkhor ruins, Bangkok, Hong Kong; wonderful!  And remembering the vast
expanse of Captain Bligh's Pacific, why not Fiji and Tahiti?

<p>

By this time I was spending almost as much time in the downtown Los Angeles
Air France office as at Sunset Tower West.  They had the International Edition
of the OAG, and the British ABC as well, and attractive female assistance. And
they knew me from the New York AF inaugural, which I winningly described from
the Riffelberg onward just in case one of the ladies was between boyfriends.

<p>

Air France was pioneering the Tokyo/Paris transpolar route, with 707 jets no
less, and BA was flying Comets, with a very different engine arrangement, on
the Sydney/London long haul.  And about this time, I began to exchange letters
with Roberto Olivetti, to whom I had been "introduced" by Vacca and Ercoli.

<p>

Soon I had a half-inch-thick Air France first class ticket [I still cherish
the bundle of passenger coupons] for a flight to Sydney, up to Tokyo, over to
Paris, down to Milan, and back via New York to LA.  Twenty-six legs, in the
end: much longer than a mere RTW [Round The World].

<p>

There was a nice intromission.  My original itinerary took me to Fiji, then
doubled back to Tahiti by flying boat [!!!], and cost quite a bit extra.  The
tall Australian girl who was selling me the Air France masterpiece called me
at my "office" on Sunset.  There is a new airline coming in to Los Angeles
from Paris via the Far East, she said, and Air France will handle it for a
year or two.  They are making their initial return about the time you want to
go, and they are routed via Papeete.

<p>

This was TAI, Transports Aeriens Intercontinentaux [now UTA].  If I juggled my
transpacific flights a bit, I could not only start a few days later, and spend
a day longer on Tahiti, but save two hundred of my own dollars.  Wow!

<p>

I talked to the chap who had just been appointed TAI sales manager for the
U.S.  He said they would accomodate me in Tourist, since the first class was
filled up for the inaugural flight with assorted VIPs.  I said OK, but if I
held on to my first class coupon would he promote me to First Cabin if some
VIP no-showed?  Not likely on a free trip to Tahiti, he laughed, but sure!

<p>

And that was what happened.  The extra time before starting was just what I
needed to straighten out some of the mess that Robbie and his nasties had
created.  And while I was doing it my Air France lady called to say that,
ahem, Ava Gardner had dropped out, and I had been assigned her space!

<p>

There was no counter yet for TAI at LAX, but I found a great champagne
farewell party underway at an air freight hangar.  The DC7C - yes, propellers
- was in from Paris and Papeete, with a load of somewhat frazzled French VIPs
and some very thirsty crew members (both groups were staying over, while
U.S. VIPs and a fresh crew that Air France had deadheaded in via the Atlantic
two days before, took over).

<p>

It was complicated, in the inimitable French way.  The French guests were to
see Hollywood, San Francisco, Vegas and so forth, and return to Paris on the
next flight (same plane, a week later).  The U.S.  guests, most of whom could
not afford to be away as long as the French VIPs, were to have a three-night
stopover in Papeete and go back to Los Angeles on the flight that was to pick
up the French guests.  The whole ball of wax included crew rests in New
Caledonia and Tahiti, a crew change at LAX, and at least a day to load more
champagne on the DC7C at Orly!

<p>

Problem for the Ava Gardners was that the affair used up a whole week. And
everybody except the air crews were confused by the International Date Line,
and crossing the equator.  Well, not me - after all, I had been an astronomer!

<p>

As I circulated, champagne flute in hand (real glass; this was French VIP
treatment), I began to realize I was not all that much out of my depth.  I
wasn't Ava, no - but I knew several of the guests and had connections to
others.  Through Evendale I knew the publisher of Aviation Week and the
president of Western Airlines; through the ARS and IBM I knew two NASA people,
and by a London social accident I knew the English wife of the French consul
in San Francisco.  Soon I was swept up by the group, and in fact not only got
Ava's hut and complimentary Mini Renault but was asked to keep them when the
American troop went back to LAX.  What wonderful good fortune!

<p>

The big bird landed to refuel at Honolulu, crossed the Equator and made most
of us in first class into shellbacks, and landed on a long but little-used
airstrip on Bora Bora.  The airport "building" was an open-sided thatched
shelter, but a good party was laid on anyhow.  Meanwhile a huge Sunderland
double-decked flying boat was landing in the lagoon, and we were taken out to
her by two launches - the entire Bora Bora fleet.

<p>

We took off to remarkable tintinnabulations, flew low across a dozen atolls
and islands, and ended at dusk in Papeete harbor, welcomed by a terrific
dancing troupe.

<p>

The airport at Faaa was under construction, and when it opened a year or so
later it killed off the flying boats with TAI, but they continued to operate
as Polynesian Airways or some such, for another decade.

<p>

The best-known member of our VIP group (now that Ava had dropped out) was a
grizzled Pacific figure who owned the most famous older hotel on Waikiki
Beach, the Royal Hawaiian.  He operated his own long-range PBY amphibian, and
flew all over the enormous South Pacific.  There were only a few ladies; the
best-looking was the wife of the Chief Pilot of Air Madagascar [an AF feeder],
but I much preferred the English lady from San Francisco, who was a
manufacturing chemist [!!] even though married into the French diplomatic
corps.  And sexy in spite of it!

<p>

And it was not only the male VIPs who missed Ada.  The hut maids at Hotel
Tahiti made it clear I was a poor poor substitute.

<p>

We had arrived on May 8th.  After a hectic but wonderful three days of
partying and sightseeing, the VIPs - by this time I was saying "the rest of
the VIPs" - were flown back, and I was left in The Little Hut, with a gratis
rental car and free room and board.  Very lavish!

<p>

I founded the Polynesian Information Processing Society in the bar, and
published a story about it in DATAMATION some months later.  Membership
entitled you to say "I'm a PIP" and to attend the annual meeting "on any
island of the South Pacific not having an IBM office".  Cecil Hastings was to
be an honorary member.

<p>

Parenthetically, when I got back to Papeete almost twenty years later, IBM had
an office there, servicing the French atomic test sites.  The PIP meets no
more - but I'm remembering one can now fly into Easter Island.  Surely,
surely, IBM will never ...

<p>

Well, TI 89 showed up westbound on Bora Bora and took me away to Nandi.  The
distances were huge.  I not only crossed the International Date Line for the
first time, but saw my very first in-flight movie!  That was 2100 statute
miles: seven hours, in propellers.

<p>

I took a ground taxi to Korolevu Beach [30 miles], snorkeled amid gorgeous
deserted coral reefs, flew air taxi back to Nandi - never did get to Suva -
and boarded TEAL for New Zealand.  That was Tasman Empire Air Lines, now Air
New Zealand.  Electra turboprops; I was wondering whether the wing spars had
been changed from the older design.  There had been crashes, which I feared
had been due to floating point calculations on the two Lockheed 701s.  Not
true, it turned out; it was faulty applied math, not computing software, that
buckled the wings.

<p>

From Auckland I flew on to Christchurch and Dunedin, my lifetime farthest
south [46 degrees], where a rental car awaited.  Getting it had involved the
New Zealand consulate in New York; Hertz and Avis were not yet trying!  It was
a green Holden sedan, and not much compared to my delicious Alfa Spyder back
on Sunset, but I drove away with enthusiasm anyhow, to a hotel in Queenstown.

<p>

Having done a very thorough job of guidebook reading back in New York, I had
booked a light-plane flight out of the tiny airport, first along the famous
Track and the waterfalls, then to a landing on the beach at Milford Sound
(where the operators of the lodge were just closing up for their winter - May
20th!), and finally after tea off to circle Mount Aspiring in the New Zealand
Southern Alps (reminding me and two other passengers of the Matterhorn).

<p>

Stupendous scenery; I have been back to South Island three times, and it
remains a scantily populated Earthly Paradise - ten times more sheep than
people!  Good university at Christchurch, too.

<p>

Well, I drove next day to the handsome new Hermitage Lodge at Mount Cook - a
very different surround from Zermatt, but full of end-of-season climbers
nevertheless.  And it was the weekend.  I had not brought any climbing gear
except light boots, but managed to get up to the famous Ball Hut anyhow and
take a few pictures, which I still treasure.

<p>

On the Tuesday I turned the muddied little car in at Christchurch Airport and
flew away happily to Sydney and computerdom on another TEAL Electra, thirteen
hundred miles of blue Pacific.

<p>

Youngsters from John Bennett's crew met me at the busy airport, saw me to my
luxury hotel, and arranged to get me out to the conference next day.  Most of
the British guests were in cheaper quarters, and there were only five or six
Americans; I stole off to King's Cross and enjoyed mild Australian raunch:
nothing to what it is like today.

<p>

A computer conference was Big News in Sydney, and I got a good spread in the
press, mostly because I said naughty things about IBM and knew a great deal
about the British adventures.  In fact, I used the newspaper story at the IRS
next year to get them to not disapprove my deductions!  But I shall do better
to quote my key paragraphs from the July/August 1960 DATAMATION:

<p>
<blockquote>
<b>herb in australia</b>

<p>

The Sydney sessions were a huge (I choose the word carefully) success.
Originally Bennett, Harper [ANCCAC chairman] and the other organizers expected
one or two hundred people, and perhaps thirty or forty papers; they ended up
with six hundred registrations, 140 papers in quadruplex (usually one business
applications, two technical applications and one design session in parallel),
and a major program of visits to sample installations.  The meeting was opened
at the University of Sydney and sessions were also held at the University of
New South Wales across the city.  It gave me an eerie feeling to hear
J.P. Baxter, chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, bewail the
low output of "mathematicians and of engineers with adequate mathematical
training" and predict that the spread of computers in Australian industry
would cause a shortage of mathematics teachers in schools and universities.
Another hemisphere, same problems!  That was the official opening speech, too;
Baxter is also vice chancellor of the University of New South Wales.

<p>

Preprinted summaries of all talks were distributed at registration; these were
bound in four units, one for each parallel session - a nice touch.  There was
a well-attended cocktail party instead of a banquet; the idea may well have
been brought back by the many visitors to our JCCs from those climes, but the
well-oiled recruiting pitch was conspicuous by its absence.  The familiar
rivalries of Los Angeles and San Francisco, still lingering like grit between
the molars from two weeks before, transformed smoothly into Sydney and
Melbourne after only a few sherries.

<p>

I heard perforce less than a quarter of the papers.  Those reciting actual
accomplishments were in tune with current [U.S.] installations: quite a few
650s already, RAMACs and 7070s later this year, a 7090 for the Weapons
Research Establishment just ordered (that's IBM; about the same level of
sophistication in English equipment, of course).  The projections, though,
were closer to our current excitements: an Army DP concept like Fieldata,
overly fancy automatic coding system plans, remote data input/output and
transmission channels.  Even the extreme upper end of the size spectrum is
being considered, rather to my surprise - mostly ATLAS, but LARC and STRETCH
are under surveillance.

<p>

And the universities, with apologies to my good friends there, are falling
behind just like ours.

<p>

The largest newspaper put out a special section on the meeting, with five
pages of ads from the major English manufacturers.  I made the front page, via
a photograph cribbed from an old DATAMATION masthead, and so did Thompson of
LEO Computers Ltd.  Swann of Ferranti's also came down.  Burroughs, Remington
Rand, and Bendix (there's a G-15 in Sydney) were represented by their local
affiliates, and there were substantial pushes from English Electric and EMI.
There is no purely Australian effort - nothing, at any rate, corresponding to
the Holden automobile, which while a GM product is designed for and
manufactured in Australia.  My educated guess, based on only a week in the
country, would be that IBM and Ferranti are tussling for the lead ....

<p>

The number of major applications will probably be out of proportion to the
Australian population (say ten million people).  But the tasks are smaller;
thus the largest stock broker in Sydney or Melbourne needs a 7070, not a 7080.
Balanced against this is the tremendous optimism and excitement of the
Australian boom and the scarcity of clerical workers.

</blockquote>
<p>

I reverted to tourism and anonymity after four days, made my own way out to
the airport, and boarded my first BOAC Comet.  Unlike the 707 and DC8, it
carried its Rolls Royce engines in the wing roots, giving a lovely sleek look
and a few miles per hour faster speed.  Trouble was, changing engines took a
day or more as opposed to hours for GE or P&amp;W machinery; also, it presupposed
future engines would be small, and I knew from AGT Evendale that the economies
of fan engines carried with them necessarily bigger diameters.

<p>

And although I was a first class passenger, nobody on the crew wanted to talk
engines with an ex-Evendaler!

<p>

Even at cometary speeds, it took forever to cross the empty heart of
Australia.  BA709 refueled at Darwin and Djakarta, and put me down almost
eleven hours later in Singapore.  Needless to say, I had reserved at the
Raffles, Traveller's Palms and all, and found it a great relief from airports
and air passengers.  I had no computer contact on that first visit, but
concentrated on eating and sightseeing.  On later trips I got to see Kuala
Lumpur and such, but in 1960 the ex-colony was pretty quiet, and there was no
time to explore the tailoring shops.

<p>

Next day I took a less interesting 707 to Bangkok, where I had allowed time
for temple trotting.  This was partly intentional, but mostly due to the fact
that I had been unable, even with the expert help of my handsome Australian AF
agent in Los Angeles, to figure out a way into Angkor.  My Air Madagascar
chief pilot had told me in Papeete it was just as well: "The end of the
earth," he called Siem Rep airport.  "Even if you get in you may be stuck
there for days."

<p>

Bangkok traffic was wild, and driving was on the left, and the stop signs were
lettered in Thai [but octagonal!].  Still, I wanted to try my hand; after 1954
on Buckingham Palace Road it didn't scare me - much!  Problem was, like New
Zealand, Hertz and Avis had not arrived, nor Godfrey Davis either.  The Erawan
sent me to a garage that was amazed I wanted to not have a chauffeur, and
asked four hundred bucks deposit in consequence.

<p>

As I emptied my wallet of Air Travel cards and assorted plastic, the young
lady who had been assigned me because of her good English espied my 1958 IBM
ID card.  "Oh," she said, " I have an IBM electric typewriter!" and waived the
deposit.  I thought it better not to tell her I had been fired avec
impressement 53 weeks earlier: bless you, T.J., wherever you are, I thought.

<p>

The driving was mostly difficult because of finding my way, but I had a map
with icons of the major temples [wats] superimposed, and one could often see
their spires in the distance.  I finally got to the Wat Arun, a fabulous
structure garnished with broken crockery as I recall, climbed up and around on
it while remembering the top of St. Paul's in just-postwar London, and took
some great Kodachromes.  And back at the hotel I was braced by a rambunctious
American who had heard me lecture in Chicago.  Cooo!

<p>

I had three amazing days, and drove out to the airport past ditches full of
water buffalos to board a familiar PanAm 707 - the famous globe-circling
Flight 2 - for Hong Kong.  It was of course my introduction to the terrifying
approach path into Kai Tak, leavened by the fact that my seat mate in first
class turned out to be the pilot's wife!  Thanks to her husband, we made it.

<p>

I had booked into the famous Peninsula Hotel in Kowloon, and was intoxicated
with its splendor.  Didn't forget to buy goodies for my eager wife back in
Manhattan, either: Thai silk, very much more cunningly offered than at the
Erawan.

<p>

In later years the city became a major computing center, but in 1960 it was
pretty much commercial DP (and punched cards, at that).  I had almost three
days to look around, and found my British connections more useful than even
those with IBM.  My reports in DATAMATION were scanty on Bangkok and Hong
Kong.

<p>

I gorged myself on strange foods - not all Chinese, either - and explored
Victoria as well as the mainland side.  I knew about <i>taipans</i> but only
on later trips got to meet any. The Peninsula was better for richies than
techies, however, so it was with mild relief that I boarded a Britannia
propjet for Tokyo.

<p>

This was my first Canadian Pacific flight since Elizabeth and I had weathered
Amsterdam/Churchill on our 1956 honeymoon, and my first Britannia.  It was a
long although very comfortable six hours; a Comet or 707 would have taken
four.  First cabin service had begun to offer sake and hot facecloths, which
helped.

<p>

My seatmate was a stocky Japanese businessman of perhaps fifty.  He saw me
reading a copy of DATAMATION which I was marking up to show in Tokyo, and
gently opened a conversation.  His name - we exchanged "name cards" early on,
as I already knew I should do - was Kurosawa, and he was the boss of the
Japanese company that marketed and serviced Creed teletype equipment.
"Electronics soon!" he said.

<p>

He was discreetly surprised that I would venture into Tokyo (and on a first
visit) without introductions.  I explained I was known to people like Goto,
and that I could call at IBM "although I now work for a customer".  And I told
him I had some knowledge of the doings at the ETL, Electrotechnical
Laboratory, although no acquaintances as yet.  Growing bolder, I told him a
little of my history, which he absorbed stoically.

<p>

He began to describe the structure of JEIDA, the Japan Electronic Industries
Development Association, of which his company was an active member.  I had
read nothing about it in DMN or the WSJ (and had not yet become a regular
reader of the HERALD TRIBUNE, which didn't cover Japan very well in 1960 - or
computers, for sure!), so I listened intently.  He said as soon as he reached
his office he would call and tell them of my arrival, and that I should have
the concierge (he said "hall porter", reflecting the Englishness of his Creed
connection) call and arrange a visit for me "with a Mr. Takasaki, who speaks
good English".

<p>

We parted with much expression of esteem (I practised bowing, rather
clumsily), saying we would get together in a few days.  Decades later, I am
curious he did not offer me a ride into town - being met by family instead of
just his driver, perhaps?  I paid an enormous fare for a taxi to the Nikkatsu,
not being sure enough of the interchanges to use cheaper methods.  My mouthing
of <i>"Nikkatsu hoteru"</i> worked, to my relief; my New York guidebook was
not sophisticated enough to print the <i>kanji</i> to show drivers.  Within
the hour I had bought a wonderful white-covered one that did!

<p>

As I had been warned, finding one's way was the overwhelming problem.  A
primitive and very very expensive method was to have the, ah, hall porter call
ahead, write the extremely complicated directions (which everyone who had
foreign visitors expected to have to give) on a small paper which had "Take me
back to the Nikkatsu" printed at the bottom in Japanese and three western
languages.  After some consultations between the hotel doorman, and the
occasional selection of another <i>equipe</i>, the taxi would take you away,
and another would [usually] bring you back.  Attempts to do this for more than
one excursion at a time were almost impossible, the directions on how to get
from Address One to Address Two not being available.

<p>

My own skills, not yet honed as they would be in years to come, were still
enough to do better than that.  I had a subway map with much English, another
looking quite different and with much <i>kanji</i>, and a way with hall
porters.  Marking Tokyo University and the equivalent on the two maps, I set
out to meet Goto.

<p>

Not able to match either map with the highly stylized subway signs, I relied
on digital methods.  Both my maps said the hotel stop was much closer to one
end of the line: six stops that way, eight the other to the university and
then on to the second terminus.  So, trying to orient myself in an underground
maze, I took the likelier direction, passed seven stops ["Ah!"] and got off.
Needless to say, I was memorizing the return.

<p>

This was a time when American Viet Nam policy was angrifying Japanese in
general and college students in particular, so it was with some trepidation
that I asked for campus directions.  The second young man I asked, however,
not only had very good English, enquired of several others in the scurrying
throng about physics labs, but broke off his own concerns to escort me
personally to the very door of Goto's office.  Ah, Japan!  Much bowing and
<i>domo arigato</i>ing, of course, helped by Goto himself popping out and
adding his own thanks to mine.

<p>

Nothing in my notes or the scant trade literature tells me whether it was
known that Goto was going to join IBM, but I was constrained to talk only
about technical matters in any case.  He wanted to hear about solid state
research in the West [about which he was much better informed than I], but
found my stories and pictures about IBM and competitive user adventures fairly
interesting.  He was far better read than I in the IRE/AIEE/IEE literature,
had never heard of or seen MTAC, and I felt he paid little heed to gossipy
magazines like DATAMATION.

<p>

He looked carefully at my souvenirs from the San Francisco Joint, only a month
old (it seemed like years, back before Tahiti!) but asked about other talks
than the ones I had sat through.  He told me more about ETL but not much about
the JEIDA shop.  And he called his best contact in the marketing side of IBM
Japan and arranged a meeting for me next day.  It was a good visit, made easy
by my obvious respect for his research and my intense but friendly curiosity
about the little-known Tokyo computer scene.

<p>

I went that evening to the world-famous Nichigeki Music Hall just down the
street from my hotel, and enjoyed it immensely.  It was a Japanese version of
Vegas, not the Reeperbahn, and I would have enjoyed even more nudity and much
more raunch, but it was lovely.  Featured a blond, um, goddess from Australia,
I faintly remember.

<p>

I was invited to lunch at the American Club by IBM, and there met for the very
first time Kaoru Ando, who is still a valued friend - and two decades later
was to be the chairman of IFIP (which in 1960 was just being put together).
He was at that time head of national marketing, under a Madison Avenue World
Trade type whom I have forgotten.  The manager's boss, a big bruiser named
Irwin from 590 whom I had met, was also visiting.  The luncheon was enlivened
by a table-hop by an ecstatic American from Sony carrying - waving, in fact -
the very first table model TV any of us had seen: a twelve-inch cube,
harbinger of the "miniature" years to come.

<p>

IBM Japan was not invited into all JEIDA activities, and Ando (who did not yet
realize Learson had hung it on me the year before, although Irwin knew) was
elated that I would get a tour of the JEIDA installation later in the day.  He
told me the situation was that while "several" companies were sharing exhibit
space, they had competing sales efforts, and problems with partly-shared
maintenance which made it difficult to hide hardware idiosyncracies.  I
giggled.

<p>

I tried hard to pump for market data, knowing that Irwin would shut the flow
down as soon as the gang got back to the office.  I put what little I got into
my DMN column, of course, along with what the locals told me.

<p>

"JEIDA" turned out to be the J.E.I.D.A. Computer Center, a square building in
Minato-ku.  It dated back to mid-1958, and was subscribed to [in 1960] by 58
manufacturers.  Besides the Center, the outfit concerned itself with patents
and licenses, worried about quality control, planned to do export promotion
when there was more to export, and interacted with researchers (university and
ETL, I assume).  The brochure I have says "....the development of the
[electronic] industry is an essential factor for tomorrow's prosperity of
Japan."  How true!

<p>

Isao Takasaki was a Fujitsu contribution to the Center.  It was a non-standard
deviation from the normal big-company career path, and in later years led to
his heading a wholly-owned subsidiary called "Algorithm" which was a very
early software house; a good job, and making use of his English skills, but a
side track.  He then migrated, amazingly, to a line job at Nippon Electric,
where we lost contact.

<p>

He welcomed me cordially, already knew about my curious career and my Evendale
building, and had read some of my articles - not the very earliest, about
astronomy or table-making, but management stuff and the DATAMATION columns,
and from them knew Grosch's Law.  Very flattering.

<p>

He had already reserved dinner spaces at The Inn Of The Badger for the two of
us and a couple of other JEIDAns with English.  He first gave me a detailed
tour of the four computer areas in the building, loaded me down with
literature (which he finally recaptured and sent by messenger to the hotel
next day!), and described in detail the organizational aspects of both the
Center and the association.  The latter was ostensibly headed by the president
of Toshiba; the Fujitsu board member was a man named Wada whom I never met,
but the actual direction was by one Tamotsu Saito.  Takasaki headed two of the
five departments under Saito, notably running the computers and most of the
building.

<p>

It was bigger than I expected - four stories, nearly 20,000 square feet, and
with its own power arrangements and air conditioning.  The four major machines
were a NEAC-2203, a HITAC-301, a FACOM-212 and a TOSBAC-III (but within the
Center known as JEIDAC-101, -102, -201 and -202 respectively).  The first two
were small-to-medium by U.S. standards, the others small; three were
transistors and diodes, the FACOM all Goto parametrons.  Multiply speeds
ranged from 5.4ms [NEC] to 16ms [Toshiba].  The first two had fast little
drums, Fujitsu had core (but not much).  Three had slow page printers but
Toshiba had a big line printer; my handwritten note says "OKI"; that would
seem unlikely except that Oki had shown a printer in Paris.  As you read this,
remember that a hundred 7090s were rampaging back in the States, not to
mention DP shops - all with great peripherals.

<p>

Takasaki was expecting "a 650-size machine" in a few days (he didn't say from
whom) and showed me the empty space reserved for it; the IBM crew had claimed
they were actually installing 650s in Tokyo and Osaka - no customer names,
however.  Looked to me that on the scientific-user side Japan was two years
behind the U.S. and a year behind the Brits; on the commercial
payroll-and-inventory side, three years.

<p>

I still treasure the Takasaki brochure; it has crossed the North Pole once and
the Atlantic three times.  The illustrations are too dim to reproduce, but the
memories - my memories - are vivid.

<p>

Few Americans (and no Europeans, I think) dreamed in 1960 how the Japanese
would soar in the next thirty years.  But certainly I've been much less
surprised than most.

<p>

Dinner was fantastic.  We started at the sushi/tempura bar and I was
introduced to live ["dancing"] shrimp; then we took our shoes off and went
onto <i>tatami</i> for major dishes; then we put our shoes back on - I'd worn
moccasins - and had desserts sitting in straight-backed chairs on a hardwood
floor.  Weirdo plums, as I recall!  Whole gastronomic abysses beckoned.

<p>

Ando and Takasaki had each listed technical applications now being done on
local computers, but there were few surprises: an optical one more advanced
than my by-now-old-hat ray tracing, and a first adventure in airline flight
planning.  I was more interested to hear a little about history; I knew about
Goto, but there had been vacuum tube and even relay calculators in Tokyo back
in the early Fifties.  Only in the last few years has any of that been
published, and it was rare stuff in 1960.  I met the parametron Takahashi at
Goto's shop, but didn't meet the ETL Takahashi until years later.

<p>

Before I fly away to Santa Claus land, clutching my computer brochures and my
gifts for Elizabeth, I must make a few comments about the remarkable IBM
presence.  In the Fifties and Sixties virtually all the computer power in use
anywhere in Japan was rented [or sold], brought in and maintained by the
Watsonians, via the World Trade Corporation. Along with Coca Cola and a very
few other companies IBM Japan was permitted to exist and flourish as a
wholly-foreign entity, vital to the regime.

<p>

It was not until Fujitsu and its major rivals - yes, the ones with the other
three JEIDACs - came to major stature in the computer business, overseas as
well as in the archipelago, with Amdahl and Siemens for instance, that the
Japanese government began to shut off its favors.  Looking back from the
Nineties, I think everyone concerned behaved well, the Japanese and the
American manufacturers, and the Japanese computer customers.

<p>

I always leave Japan reluctantly, and never more so than on this first visit.
I struggled out to Haneda (more economically) and climbed on another fantastic
flight - what a trip!  Japan Air Lines and Air France were pioneering joint
flights right over the North Pole - well, always within a few miles - to cut
the time to Europe.  On June 9th this was AF271, with a mostly Japanese cabin
crew and great service.  It refueled in Anchorage and was scheduled to
terminate in Orly, with another quick refueling in Northern Europe if there
were headwinds.  The ordinary 747s do it easily nonstop, and the long range
jobbies can go much farther - but it was exciting in 1960.  "Divert to Thule",
indeed!

<p>

First cabin was served a fabulous Maxim's-Of-Paris meal, with the same
Laurent-Perrier <i>Grand Si?cle</i> champagne I had enjoyed on the Air
France 707 inaugural, and out of my right-hand window seat I could look south
to Peary Land, the northernmost tip of Greenland.  The captain came on the
blower and told us we were at our farthest north, "beyond 88 degrees"!  And
his Japanese counterpart said [I assumed] the same.

<p>

The flight began to deteriorate in Hamburg.  As the passengers, mixed first
and tourist class, waited in the transit lounge, the Japanese business men
found out from a Japanese stewardess that there would be a long delay.  The
windshield had cracked [!!] on landing, and there were no Air France spares
stocked at what was only a casual refueling stop.

<p>

But worse was to come.  Turned out there was a major strike in Paris, so
nothing could be flown up from Orly, and it was doubtful if AF personnel in
other European cities would hurt labor solidarity by shipping a windshield
from spares in, say, Nice!

<p>

Some vigorous soul, quite possibly either the French or the Japanese pilot,
scouted around the airport and got one of the non-European lines to "loan" our
crippled flight the necessary part. After six hours we were airborne, only to
land at Brussels (the strike was worsening in Paris).  Angry Air France
managers loaded us onto Sabena airport busses - not luxurious tourist ones,
you understand - and away we went.

<p>

I crept into the Lotti ten hours late; no longer remember whether the Paris
taxis were on strike.  There was no electricity, and there were lanterns (in
fact, I seem to remember oil lamps!) in the corridors.  Even Josef, the
normally unperturbable head concierge, was upset.  <i>Quel blague!!</i>

<p>

I had missed my appointment at Electricit? de France, and the telephones
there did not seem to be working anyhow.  I went to bed, eagerly.  It seemed
an age, aeons, since Tokyo.

<p>

Europe was ten hours earlier than Japan; we had crossed the Date Line.  But
the long long flight meant that I woke up on the weekend - no chance of
recouping the EdF visit, since I was booked out to London Monday morning.  On
an Air France Caravelle!  But the strike was over.  I called and apologized,
and was brushed off in true Parisian fashion.

<p>

I checked with Sandy Douglas, who was himself having troubles with C-E-I-R and
with Robbie, and who wanted to hear all about my legalistic decapitation.
Wasn't much interested in my stories about Japan, which was disappointing; I
was bursting with them.

<p>

The Savoy Grill was fully booked, but I had a great dinner at Kettner's.
Alone!

<p>

Wednesday morning early I took Alitalia down to see Roberto Olivetti.  He was
that day in Milan, at the magnificent offices behind La Scala, and took me off
to a wonderful informal lunch at a nearby <i>trattoria</i>.  He brought along
his chief computer designer, whom I had heard great things about in England:
Mario Tchou, who looked very Chinese but was wearing a gorgeous if somewhat
rumpled Italian silk suit (Roberto was in veddy British tweeds, with brown
suede bespoke Curzon Street shoes).  After weeks in a Papeete hut, a Korolevu
<i>bure</i>, and the Peninsula, I didn't know how to dress, let alone how to
pry computer plans out of these two sophisticates.

<p>

I came to know Roberto much better in the next few years, although I began
missing connections after the fiasco with Generous Electric - too generous, in
the Olivetti case!  But that comes later; in 1960 what I wanted was to know
whether what Vacca and Ercoli had gossiped about in 1956 at the Ferranti 1*
["One Star"] installation had moved ahead.  Both men were open about the
Olivetti ambition, which in 1960 was to develop the Borgolombardo laboratory
and build DP machines somewhere around the 650 power.

<p>

I was full of STRETCH and the other 7000-series beasts, as they expected, but
caught their attention with my comments about Goto and his parametrons, and
the JEIDA building.  Of course Olivetti was worldwide, but not doing more than
exhibit their artistic side, in Tokyo.  Like Roberto wearing Saville Row gear,
a lot of Japanese with-it types had Olivetti typewriters for western
correspondence rather than the expected IBM!

<p>

But I soon saw Tchou did not want to talk turkey: speeds, components,
peripherals (which Olivetti was well able to supply, if Ivrea engineering was
willing).  It was tantalizing, but although it had not cost me much to fly to
Milan and back, I didn't get much out of the meeting.  But, great contact.

<p>

Back in London, Stan Gill helped me lay on my first visit to Ferranti's.  I
had not been in Manchester before; I expected to talk with sales people (and
indeed met Peter Hall for the first time), as the contact with my user
community friends.  As it happened, however, I was swept away by my first
interaction with Basil de Ferranti, who sat me down next to him in the lavish
oak-panelled manager's dining room and pumped me up one side and down the
other about IBM, and the C-E-I-R advent (he knew Sandy from Leeds), and my
adventures in Tokyo - and about the room maids at the Hotel Tahiti!

<p>

Went on and on.  I missed my flight back to London, and saw almost nothing of
the rest of the plant.  But there was clearly chemistry between this man, a
dozen times more intelligent than Tom Junior, and the visiting American.

<p>

He was unhappy in his second marriage, interested in my glamor photos of
Elizabeth.  He was a major figure indeed, compared to Jobless Herb Grosch: an
MP, a helping hand in the new British Computer Society (and later a
president), a Cambridge graduate of distinction.  But "Call me Boz," he said.

<p>

The patriarch of the family, now dead, was Sir Isaac de Ferranti, who was a
very great electrical engineer and a president of the Institution of
Electrical Engineers.  The two sons Sebastian and Basil divided the management
of the still privately held company, reminding me of Tom and Dick Watson.

<p>

And the founder reminded me, coming fresh from Milan, of Carlo Olivetti, who
had begun the Ivrea enterprise - except that Roberto was third generation, not
second.

<p>

Also, like IBM but unlike Olivetti, Ferranti had a Big Thing with the
military.  This was Sebastian's side of the house, and it was much more
important to the company than Charlie Benton's Military Products Division had
been to IBM.  Boz was the father figure to the computer side, however, knew
and admired Stan Gill, and was supplying money and encouragement to the ATLAS
crew.

<p>

I had had operating manuals and such for Ferranti machines from my C-E-I-R
visit, but as the Defense Calculator/701 documentation had constantly changed
eight years before, so the material about the Arguses and Pegasi and other
machines coming to fruition in Manchester was reworked and reworked.  And
ATLAS, like STRETCH had been, was a one-off or few-off adventure, so the
paperwork was scant, dated, and dumb looking.  I got a 14-inch-long
paper-covered thing hot from the mimeograph on this visit which would be a
historical artifact today, but it was of course superseded in months.

<p>

The works manager's chauffeur took me downtown to the grand Midland Hotel,
where I found out next morning my bill had been paid "by Ferranti's, sir".  I
had trouble with my fabulous Air France ticket, although it had worked fine
northbound, and ended up on the train, sharing a seat in the elegant dining
car with a gentleman from Armstrong Vickers who had been at the Ferranti
luncheon the day before.

<p>

He was still chuckling at my remark while watching the works manager carve the
leg of lamb [yes!!]  while the waitresses carried the plates around, that
Generous Electric would have to add carving abilities to its careful list of
required managerial skills.  The men already have to play fair golf, I pointed
out.

<p>

When I got back to the Savoy, where I had of course retained my room in
expectation of a shorter excursion, I got the hall porter to check that my
dwindling ticket was still in order, said goodbye reluctantly to London, and
flew back to the U.S.  I was on an Alitalia DC8 which had problems with an
injector plug before takeoff, and while the maintenance laddies were fiddling
I was invited up to the cockpit, where I talked about GE engines and the
Sunderland flying boat.

<p>

Elizabeth had come out to Idlewild to welcome me.  I was a little worried that
I might have been away too long; it had been over six weeks, and almost 35,000
statute miles.  But she was delighted with me; backed me into a quiet corner
and showed me she had worn "your favorite costume" under her silky raincoat -
and she had!!

<p>

It was the most wonderful adventure of a lifetime.  I took one longer trip in
May and June of 1974, and that was also to exotic places.  But for so early on
in the jet age, and to see so many new aspects of computing up and down and
around the world, and especially to have first reached into Japanese computing
- well, 1960 was the greatest.

<p>

In a worldwide 1996 society where literally millions of computer lovers (and
not a few computer haters) await each month's flood of books and magazines and
newspapers, all clamoring to inform and misinform and disinform about every
tiniest cranny of computerdom, it is hard to cast back to a simpler time when
only professionals cared; to a time, indeed, when one of the major tasks of
those happy few was to suck a little edible marrow from the bare bones of
engineering journals, decipher ACM hoity-toity, and evaluate the occasional
and usually wildly misleading references in the business and general press.

<p>

Mostly it's a change, an enormous change, in scale.  Today we read about
gigantic multi-billion-dollar adventures to reconstruct the U.S. air traffic
control system, or transfer the IRS to an unmanageable network of untrained
users at the keyboards of tens of thousands of desktops designed and built by
the lowest bidder; yesterday it was Roddy Osborne boasting in the Harvard
Business Review of how he was going to run the GE Appliance Park payroll on
the third UNIVAC I, at a total cost - hardware and software and consultants -
less than it takes to write, and market on CD/ROM, a 1990s virtual-reality
game for bored adolescents!

<p>

A watershed between the two eras was the appearance in the late Fifties of the
first trade journal, DATAMATION.  Here it was possible to look at computers
from the outside; to bring the skills of professional journalists and the
knowledge of professional computer users together; to poke fun at the wild
doings of the trade, in a way no stiff professor or Surly Seymour Cray or
overeager IBM salesman could ever do.

<p>

I had time after my Los Angeles adventures with C-E-I-R and my startling visit
to Tokyo to carry on a frequent column for the pages of the magazine.  I
called it "Plus Or Minus" at first, foreshadowing the much longer series of
articles I wrote a decade later for Pat McGovern's trade newspaper
COMPUTERWORLD: "Black Hat, White Hat".  And one of the newly acceptable
subjects was the interaction of computers and society.

<p>

Could I turn some of my concern into cash?  DATAMATION paid me a few dollars
for each column - generous by their standards, minuscule by mine, living in
Sutton Place luxury just down the street from Greta Garbo and Mary Martin.  I
cast about.

<p>

The New York Times, and DATAMATION in a very different way, were full of
criticism of IBM.  The Watson Empire was doing gloriously; 7090s and 7080s and
650s were pouring out of the factories, World Trade was burgeoning, customers
were being convinced that their opportunity to buy as well as lease was a New
Birth Of Freedom.

<p>

But there were mutterings: computers take away jobs, computers invade privacy,
computers make decisions for us, computers are dehumanizing: turn us into mere
numbers.  Old stuff today - current discourse for decades.  New in 1961.  I
rolled up my sleeves and wrote Tom Watson.

<p>

IBM is on the griddle, I said.  People are beginning to worry about the
computer: it puts them out of work, it looks like Big Brother, it will
dehumanize them.  "I'm sure you have PR types combatting these attitudes.  How
about stressing the really good things IBM, and that new social tool the
computer, might do for everybody?  Be positive," I said.

<p>

It worked.  Rather to my surprise, I was hired by Dean McKay to do a study I
proposed to call "Social Gains From The Computer Revolution".  I holed up in
Sutton House, breaking away only to walk the poodle D?odat or when
Elizabeth was especially enticing, and in two weeks produced a rather handsome
set of proposals.  The title had evolved into "Social Problems and the
Computer Revolution".  I sent off copies to McKay and his people, and to Mac
Smith.  And I sent a marked-up copy to Tom himself.

<p>

McKay wrote, "Attached is our check for $1115.00 [I'd charge five or ten times
as much today] covering your consulting services ....  If we do not utilize
any of the ideas included in [the report], you are indeed free to offer them
to others.  Thanks for your help."  Nice!

<p>

In sending a copy to Tom Junior, who was not likely to read the whole thing
himself, I had attached a very vigorous cover letter which I was sure he would
read completely, and had therefore built in a summary of the report and my
four proposals.  I give the letter in full:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
                                        415 East 52nd Street
                                          New York, New York
                                               9 August 1961
Mr. Thomas J. Watson, Jr.
Chairman of the Board
International Business Machines Corporation
New York 22, New York

Dear Tom:

Since 19 July I've been at work on a position paper for Mac Smith and
Dean McKay.  They asked me to summarize briefly some of the negative
aspects of the computer revolution, and to expand in some detail several
projects which would present the computer - and IBM, its main sponsor -
in a favorable light.  Since the assignment arose from your interest in
my earlier expressions of concern, I thought you might like a copy of
the report and a short summary of your own place in my proposals.

First, though, bear with me while I write frankly about IBM, about you,
and about the American scene.  In twenty years, barring nuclear
disaster, IBM is going to be the largest corporation in the free world;
even now it is one of the best known, one of the most profitable; it
leads in research; it has a tradition of public service.  Perhaps most
important of all, it has a personality; it isn't faceless,
committee-ridden, reactionary.  To a very great degree that personality
is an extension of your own, and of your father's.  The leadership of
IBM in the corporate milieu and your own position in IBM, in the
business world because of IBM, and on the American economic and
political scene independent of IBM, impose real obligations.  In spite
of what you wrote me in 1959 [after the Cal Tech incident], I remain
convinced that IBM at your behest, and you independently, can and should
contribute new ideas, new leadership on the national and international
stage.

For one thing, you have far more freedom of action, far more freedom of
intellectual choice, than a Webb [NASA], a McNamara [Pentagon], a
Kennedy.  You are firmly in the saddle; you can muster the resources of
IBM and, I believe, larger resources among your peers.  But most of all,
and central to my proposals, you owe it to the culture IBM is
transforming to reach out for awareness and responsibility.

In the report I point out that the computer is an outstanding artifact
of that transformation, that it personifies automation and
centralization and complete information.  And I point out the obvious,
that IBM is the computer, that it in the same way personifies all the
information machines, all the technologies involved.  There's a lot more
to the technological explosion than computers, and a lot more to
computers than IBM - no matter; you are going to be the target.

I've recommended some fairly forthright positions as regards mechanized
decision-making, the computer as Big Brother, and so on.  But for once
in my bull-headed life I advise caution: in the area of technological
disemployment.  Keep yor own house in order, use the available
palliatives generously, keep your company intelligensia informed - and
avoid any official position if you can.  Meanwhile, establish IBM, and
yourself personally, as valued spokesmen, as advocates of scientific
progress for social good.

On the positive side, I have listed four projects:

1.  A television program, "The Two Cultures," designed to describe new
advances in science, deplore the breach between men of affairs and men
of technology, and present IBM as a bridge between them.  You and Sir
Charles Snow would be the first guests, and I would hope you would use
the program further to present yourself to a broader segment of the
population.

2.  A computer simulation of the complete metropolitan New York
transportation pattern: a city planning tool of unprecedented power.
Until a fine-grained model of everything from pedestrians to ocean
liners is available, piecemeal solutions now advocated are foredoomed.
You would play the same role in the program that Richard Mellon did in
the reconstruction of downtown Pittsburgh.

3.  Computer services for the proposed U.S. Disarmament Agency for World
Peace and Security (S.  2180), or for the U.N.  Here you would decide
whether IBM or its World Trade subsidiary should make the offer, and
frame the approach to Rusk or McCloy or Humphrey, or to Hammarskj?ld.

4.  A detailed computer simulation of the entire American economy,
private, public, and military.  This would be a tool available to the
Congress, to the Executive Branch, to major political parties, to trade
associations and unions, to the universities, to the press.  The idea is
to quantify and rationalize discussions of the national purpose, and to
clarify our vision of economic growth, full employment, assistance to
needy nations, and scientific progress.

With the help of a few of your friends, you would organize the
sponsoring committee.  The technical task would be performed by a
non-profit organization, financed originally by your committee but
ultimately self-supporting.  The operation would furnish a tool, not
recommend policy; it would be non-coercive, non-political; your names
would guarantee the power, the availability, the morality of the tool.

I end the report by saying of this last project, " ... as in few other
areas of human effort, we see clearly the power of the tool which IBM
sponsors, the intelligence amplifier that can help us determine as well
as achieve our goals."  More than anyone else in the free world, Tom,
you have that tool at your command.

    Sincerely,
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

Watson wrote back immediately, first thanking me and then saying, "Frankly,
several of the projects you recommend cause me some concern since they might
lead us beyond what I would consider to be the proper role of a corporation in
our society.  Nevertheless ... I am asking our people to give them most
careful consideration."

<p>

I replied, "Your concern about the proper role of a (large) corporation in our
American society is natural, and an important parameter of any discussion
about positive contributions by computer technology.  I wonder, though, if my
ideas are really so different from your own, or just expressed less
magisterially?
 
<p>

"I'd like to suggest a further report on exactly that topic: should a
corporation participate in The Great Discussion, the determination of national
objectives; should it openly advocate social improvement; what can it do that
other 'forces' in our culture can not?  If a written report seems too formal,
I'd like at least to talk with you about the matter, and also about your
personal role."

<p>

Alas, he shied away.  Replying again immediately, he said Dean McKay and his
people would go on studying "actions they feel we should take as a
corporation", and asked me to "continue to contact Mr.  McKay ... on those
areas of our activity in which you feel you might be able to contribute."

<p>

McKay wrote (on September 14: the whole interaction took only four weeks):

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Dear Herb:

I have had an opportunity to discuss your report with several people in
the company.

They were unanimous in their praise for your lucid and well-written
presentation.  However, the consensus is one of doubt as to the
suitability of IBM's leadership role in the specific projects.

We know that some work is being done on the urbanization problem, and we
hope to contribute our particular competence and skill when appropriate.
This is also true in regard to the disarmament agency for world peace.

Whenever our federal government or others who have the authority and
responsibility to tackle a social or economic problem need our
assistance, we would be more than happy to provide it.  But we doubt
that it is appropriate to take on the functions of existing institutions
just because we possess a unique competence.

As to the television suggestion, we have never made the basic decision
that it is sound for us to undertake an advertising program aimed at the
general public.  We must make this decision first [it took twenty
years]; after that we would then focus on the choice of a television
show.

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

It seems to me now that this was the closest I ever came to the levers of
power.  In later years I climbed to the top of the Federal civil service, and
bid for minor appointive positions.  But these would have affected Uncle Sam's
computer policies, not the broad economic scene, not the disproportion between
armament and disarmament access to computer power, not the New York traffic
tangles, let alone the gap between Snow's Two Cultures.

If Watson Junior in the Sixties had been Watson Senior in his prime, but with
the enormous and growing power of latterday IBM at his fingertips, and if I
could have reached The Old Man as easily as I had reached Young Tom, would he
have had McKay say, "We doubt that it is appropriate ... just because we
possess a unique competence"?  I think not; he gloried in the unique
competence of "the IBM" - and in his own.

<p>

Not all of my adventures stemmed from IBM.  My lovely 1954 tour with Dorothy
and my 1956 honeymoon with Elizabeth, plus the ICIP acquaintances and gossip,
plus the DATAMATION overseas news in every issue since I had become a
contributing editor in November 1959, had given me perspectives very different
from people in World Trade New York or even the de Waldner types at IBM Europe
who were still hiding around behind the Place Vend?me.

<p>

For one thing, I was still very much interested in hardware.  Watching Palmer
and Haddad and Rochester, and especially Frank Hamilton, whose 650 was making
waves in the user community worldwide by now, had made me feel good.  I wanted
to keep up, although I could no longer be creative.  The gulf between salesmen
- and IBM was using natives, as The Old Man had decreed decades before - and
French engineers at the manufacturing plant out in the bush was unbridged, and
indeed there was only detailed redesign going on anyhow.  There would be fancy
stuff in the next four years, culminating in major contributions to the 360
systems in 1964, but it was just starting.

<p>

What that meant was that the Paris executives knew about competitive sales but
not competitive design, except indirectly via intelligence collected in the
U.S. and fed back to Paris.  Red Dunwell, sweating over STRETCH and HARVEST
back in Poughkeepsie, knew ten times as much about the Gamma 60 as the
European locals, and had heard it at an American conference.

<p>

I knew, for instance, that the dozen ITT national companies all over Europe
had substantial computer design and manufacturing capabilities.  I had talked
to van der Poel, who designed the ZEBRA that Stantec, Standard Telephones and
Cables, the English ITT company, was butchering.  I knew that Bell in Belgium
was a subsidiary of ITT and not connected to the American phone company, and
that it made a curious pile-'em-up magnetic tape drive pictured in DATAMATION
which was being peddled (very poorly) across Western Europe.  And especially I
knew that the German company SEL, Standard Electric Lorenz, was really very
good, and was designing one-off airline reservation systems for airlines like
my Air France.

<p>

Now while I had been at the top of the user community, I felt pretty
amateurish as a Senior Consultant.  How could I use what I knew?  I wasn't
even very anxious for fees; what I wanted was to get in on the action - in
Europe, because I could see my knowledge of that scene was unusual (and
because I could also see I was not exactly everybody's favorite back in
Manhattan).

<p>

Back in the Evendale jet engine days I had had occasional exchanges with Marc
DeFerranti, who was a department head for LaPierre over on the manufacturing
side.  His gang did almost no business with my 701 and 704s, but I was a weird
and wonderful figure all over Jim's huge empire, so Marc (always first names,
remember?) and I did have contact.  I knew from meeting his nephew Barry at
ANCCAC that their branch of the Ferranti clan had been in Australia for many
years, although I never found out details until Boz became a fairly close
friend.

<p>

As my lawyer and I were hassling C-E-I-R, and as I was exploring a facilities
management contract with NASA Greenbelt on behalf of "my" Cleveland company, I
came across an announcement in the Times or the Wall Street Journal that
DeFerranti, who had left GE some years before, had been appointed vice
president "for Europe" by Harold Geneen, the well-known president of ITT, and
would be basing in Brussels.  I put it at the very very top of my lists, since
it was already pretty certain that the NASA job I wanted was wired for
Documentation, Inc. and its president Mort Taube, and that my paper outfit
would soon collapse.

<p>

I no longer remember how I reached him; perhaps by telephone in New York?
Certainly I did not cable Brussels.  But somehow I arranged to meet him there,
in his new office on Boulevard de l'Empereur.  Bought my own air ticket, and I
flew coach!  And needless to say, after the wonderful times they had shown me,
on Air France: March 15, 1961.

<p>

I put up at the Amigo, through Sabena, on which I had flown from Orly.  It was
my first visit to Brussels; I had driven through Belgium after ICIP in my
Ivory Lady, but north of the capital.  I looked forward to the restaurants.

<p>

Marc could not have been more cordial.  For one thing, he was lonesome in his
fine new office, with only a secretary as yet, and he was having a time
scheduling trips to his national companies without a central staff to help.
It turned out the job was indeed new, and would be what he made of it.  He was
an intelligent man, and forceful, and a graduate of the Generous Electric
management practices, but it was obviously not a simple task.

<p>

I told him of my adventures in European computing circles.  "Marc," I said,
"you have six or seven powerful electronic outfits.  No one of them, except
just maybe SEL, can buck even Bull or Siemens in computers, let alone IBM
Europe."  I didn't tell him that the various IBM national companies, driven by
the spirit of Watson Senior, would cooperate in a way the ITT affiliates had
never dreamed of: he already knew!

<p>

"Now," I went on, "if you were to set up a special extra-national entity at
SEL, or maybe even here at the Belgian outfit - not out away from everybody
like the fatheaded GE computer venture, but with the facilities of an
established shop - you could pull together a design team, drawing on Stantec
and SEL and Bell and the nutty Norwegians, who gossip says are building crypto
equipment, and then farm out the manufacturing all over your kingdom.  Sales
would have to be national, but you don't need to worry about that for a year
or two."

<p>

What I asked him for was a consulting assignment to go around to the best
three or four countries with his imprimatur, see what they were doing, and
make a simple report.  "You can suggest the idea to Geneen back in New York as
your own, Marc, and tell him you dug me up out of your GE past to look at
possibilities for you.  I need a fee, and expenses, but nothing outrageous;
the payoff would be to help organize the new outfit and run the customer
services and such, with a shot some day at the top slot, if you decide to go
ahead."

<p>

I felt much freer to talk to him than I ever had with Barney Oldfield.  I was
an absolute outsider, and certainly not any kind of threat inside ITT.  And we
shared an ex-GE viewpoint.

<p>

Well, it worked.  He made a date for dinner; like me he was a bonne bouche,
and he took me to La Maison de Cygne on the Gran Place, and paid from a pad of
francs that could have choked a horse, saying he was having trouble with
American Express!  And when I checked out at the Amigo I found the unobtrusive
secretary had already arranged to pay the bill.  Nice!

<p>

I had reservations back to New York via the Ferranti plant in Manchester,
where I planned to talk to Peter Hall, head of the Computer Department, and
Boz.  Because of that date I was nervous about going to Stantec, which was off
in the west of England besides.  But I suggested Marc might let me make a
one-day visit to SEL in Stuttgart, sort of to seal the bargain, and he agreed.
I got the Amigo concierge to buy my train tickets, which meant that they got
unexpectedly paid for when Marc picked up my tab.  He notified the national
manager that I wanted "to look on [his] behalf" at the computer projects in
that part of SEL.

<p>

I went directly to the Graf Zeppelin, where the Brussels concierge had booked
me, and the next morning took a taxi to the electronics "laboratory",
following instructions waiting for me at the hotel. There was a small language
problem, which could have been an attempt to avoid Marc's instructions.  But I
ended up with an executive named Schmidt who spoke British English and drove a
big Morris sedan, peculiar in Brussels.

<p>

He showed me the pieces of the Air France reservations system, and the
youngsters working on it had enough English to tell me some of the specs.  But
Schmidt refused to describe the details of the contract.  "You should ask
Mr. Ferranti," he said.  I told him I didn't want to know about money, but
about delivery dates and testing and installation.  No matter.

<p>

We had a long lunch out of the plant, and he delivered me back to the hotel in
time for me to see a little of the town, do a late checkout, and catch the
overnight train.  It had not been a huge success.

<p>

I reported to Marc next morning that I had seen and heard very little, but on
the other hand nothing to change my thinking that real work was being done.
"Not a boondoggle like the stuff at Electronics Park back in 1956," I laughed.
Turned out he didn't have a copy of the Air France agreement in his Brussels
files - or so he said!

<p>

I said I would go back to New York and work him up some ideas.  "Try only the
basic concept on Geneen," I said, "but use the rest of what I furnish later,
as you go around to your various national companies.  You'll have all sorts of
regular stuff to pursue, but if the computer capabilities are paraded for you,
you'll have a scenario to work from."

<p>

I asked him for two hundred dollars a day, and told him I'd only take a week
or two, and have a letter waiting for him when he got back from his next New
York trip.  We shook hands; I was elated, although I could see it was just one
of a hundred management inventions he would be accumulating in the first
months of his assignment.

<p>

And I at least would recoup my air fare!

<p>

The Ferranti visit on March 21 went well; I had done my ATLAS homework about
the STRETCH delays at Los Alamos (or in Poughkeepsie, to be exact), and
reported the interview with Bengt Carlson in DATAMATION.  I was startled to be
given a copy of the article they had just sent to LA about their huge machine,
which they hoped would do better than the two American giants.

<p>

Parenthetically, the article appeared in the May issue with a fine picture of
Peter Hall, but was somewhat overshadowed by an equally big story about the
Burroughs B5000 and its novel stack architecture.  Also it was the first issue
of DMN under Hal Bergstein's editorship, and carried the first gossip about
Seymour Cray's 6600.  A blockbuster!

<p>

Back at Sutton House I was beginning to put together my ITT ideas.  I had not
gotten any business from Ferranti's, but I had material for one of my "Plus
and Minus" columns, and hopes that if Boz and Peter Hall mounted an ATLAS
campaign in the States I would see some action.  Then one black morning I
found in the Wall Street Journal a notice that Horrid Harold Geneen had
struck: Marc was out, and literally overnight!  The reporter speculated that
it might be related to the fact that he had been involved in the antitrust
action that had so occupied Jim LaPierre back in 1957 and 1958.

<p>

I didn't believe a word of it.  Surely any negotiations, either via executive
recruiters or by ITT internal personnel people, with anyone on DeFerranti's
level - and for such a fancy job - would have explored such involvement.

<p>

I played the "Contributing Editor of DATAMATION" role to the hilt - after all,
I was Number Five on the revised masthead.  But all it got me was access to
some very crude PR and personnel people at ITT headquarters.  Accustomed as I
was to IBM suavity and GE professionalism, the complete lack of concern for
ITT's reputation, for Horrid Harold's already unfavorable image, and needless
to say for poor Marc, astounded me.

<p>

I tried to penetrate the WSJ precincts and to reach the reporter who had the
byline.  Not a chance.  I tried getting advice from Fred Hoar at UNIVAC and
even from a PR man back in Evendale ("... no longer with the company, Mr., ah,
Grosch").  "They play rough down there," seemed to be the story.

<p>

It wasn't my petty little fee.  I was unhappy for Marc, and hoped maybe I
could help with my connections - a note to Tom Watson, or Ray Eppert of
Burroughs, or whatever.  But I couldn't reach him.  He wasn't in Who's Who, or
the corporate data bases (fewer then than today).  I tried to get an
indication of where he lived from the ITT switchboard: ouch!!  I even called
Brussels long distance, hoping to get the secretary at his former office; the
New York operator reported the number had been disconnected.

<p>

I wrote a long and careful letter about "the idea Mr. DeFerranti had wanted to
explore, about evaluating ITT national company digital computer capabilities
across Europe", citing my adventures in the U.S. and for C-E-I-R in England.
I sent it off to Geneen, asking for an answer or a referral "in view of his
[Marc's] sudden departure".

<p>

No answer - nor had I expected one.  I then made up another copy, with a curt
covering note saying that "the enclosed correspondence has probably been
intercepted by your office, who are undoubtedly having some difficulty with
Mr. DeFerranti's dismissal", and sent it to his Manhattan apartment (he was in
Who's Who even if Marc was not!), requesting "the courtesy of a response".

<p>

I mailed it on a Friday.  Wow!  Monday morning I got a blistering phone call
from an ITT lawyer about invasion of Mr. Geneen's privacy, disregard of
business ethics, and on and on.  When I got a word in edgewise I pointed out
mildly that a simple one-paragraph reply to the letter I had sent to Geneen's
office would have closed the matter, and that it was "Mr. Geneen's" lack of
courtesy rather than my own that was reprehensible.  I would have expressed
myself with my customary frankness about what I thought of his boss, but
realized that the caller might be recording me!

<p>

Marc never recovered.  He found a job with some sort of steel company back in
Pennsylvania as head of their international operations, escaped from there to
become a group executive for Plessey's in early 1966, in charge of the
telecommunications business, but retired the next year for reasons of health.
He went back to the U.S. and disappeared.  He was only 62.

<p>

After the brief excursion back into Watsonland, and after spending the small
but welcome fee on Manhattan living, I began to realize it was going to be
uphill for a long time.  The adventures disguised it, of course: I got so
caught up in gaudy inaugurals and circling the Matterhorn and Mount Aspiring I
tended to forget that DATAMATION only paid a hundred bucks an article, and
that my gross income from two Ferrantis, a Watson and an Olivetti hadn't been
much over a thousand.

<p>

I had a small commission from Dause Bibby, who had recently left a secure vice
presidency in IBM and come over to the opposition.  I had been snooping around
his RemRand bailiwick on lower Park Avenue, trying to persuade Jay Schnackel
and Howard Engstrom and other disconsolate types to find a place for me on the
ERA if not the Univac side.  All I remember today is the non-self-levelling
elevator!  But Dause and I rather liked each other, and out of nowhere he
asked me to go down to Austin and see if the University of Texas, his old Alma
Mater, would be interested in the gift of a UNIVAC I.

<p>

There was by this time the beginnings of a computer science or at least a
numerical analysis group down there, and I was pretty sure Dave Young would
not want an old business-oriented machine, especially as UNIVAC IIs were being
installed and Grace Hopper was writing software for a UNIVAC III in the
Philadelphia suburbs between COBOL meetings.

<p>

But I dutifully trotted down, found the president, an arts man named Ransome,
very pleasant but skeptical, reported negatively to Bibby, and strolled (yes,
walking distance, just like Galactic Headquarters) back to the apartment.
"Two days' fees, but that's it!" I told Elizabeth.

<p>

I couldn't get a "no" out of Engstrom, let alone a "yes".  I was pretty sure
my NSA references had been positive, but there was so much inertia in the
whole Norwalk/Whitpain/St. Paul aggregation it wasn't very important.  I quit
calling; looked like I was dead in the water with Remington Rand too.

<p>

There were other Robbies around.  I could probably wiggle in with the Hardeyes
who had tried to buy into C-E-I-R, or do something for the Mystery Men around
Hughes Aircraft.  I could see weird operations everywhere.  On the other hand,
for every one of them there seemed to be Fletcher Joneses and Mort Taubes
already practiced at starting them, and my Cleveland attempt to do my own
thing, with real experts like John Lowe and a big-money track record with von
Braun, had not only failed but had not taught me much.  Looking back from the
Nineties, I probably discouraged too easily: should have tried several more
entrepreneurial directions.  After all, I was batting .500 with NASA; "no" at
Greenbelt, but a great "yes" at Huntsville.

<p>

But I liked being in a substantial outfit like IBM, or the jet engine
operations of GE.  My special ability seemed to be to build fast, but in an
environment where resources to do so were in place.  Assuming I was to be in
Coventry on the U.S. scene for a while, why not look further afield?  Boz and
Roberto certainly knew what I could do, and commanded powerful organizations -
and I loved the overseas ambiance.  I talked it over endlessly with Elizabeth,
who found the idea of a European Connection enticing but didn't quite know
what to do about our wonderful but feeble Aunt Grace.  "And they won't let
Little Boy into England", she pointed out.

<p>

I had made a slight diversion down to the C?te d'Azur after my shot at SEL
Stuttgart.  Just a couple of days, and mostly to look at Monaco.  Elizabeth
and I had done the tourist bit in 1956 from Beaulieu-sur-Mer, but in 1961 my
concerns were housing costs and telephone service and such.

<p>

Over the next months I did desultory library research on setting up in Europe.
Uncle Sam sent me brochures on doing business in various countries.  There
were pamphlets at the New York consulates.  I boned up on transportation: had
the OAGs, and had brought back the Thomas Cook rail guide from Zermatt.

<p>

I was pretty sure if I just asked either Basil de Ferranti or Roberto Olivetti
for some kind of job, even with a better idea of what I could do for them than
I really had, they would turn off on me immediately, send me downstairs to
people who had no interest in my coming aboard, and never enjoy talking to me
again.  Maybe not Boz, but the dog-quarantine law made a Manchester or London
spot dubious, and outlying places like Australia, where I might really have
cut a swathe for Peter Hall and his Mancunians, had the same exclusions.  I
had cautiously poked at Swann in Sydney, and been told that Ferranti staffed
its European offices with indigenes, like IBM.

<p>

I daydreamed about pushing ATLAS on the continent, from an office in
Manchester but with Elizabeth and Grace and Deo basking on the Riviera.
Trouble was, I didn't have the dense mesh of connections I had out in
California.  Slowly the idea crystallized that I should go over for a few
months, see what I might do for a British or European or even American firm,
spend as little as possible ... it was all very iffy, but not ridiculous.
And, to skip many many chapters ahead, it worked.  Barely!!  I was as usual a
pioneer; there had been early American explorers like Ike Auerbach, but no
independent consultant had actually upped anchor and come over permanently.

<p>

Used as I was to California and Arizona, I put a sunny climate high on my list
of requirements.  And in spite of the much lower costs, the Franco and Salazar
regimes in Spain and Portugal (and my complete lack of Iberian professional
contacts) made those choices unattractive, along with the Mezzogiorno and
Greece.  That left Northern Italy and Southern France - and Monte-Carlo.  The
latter's tax advantage was not important immediately, since there was nothing
to tax, but I was alerted to the problem facing foreign quasi-residents in
France, and assumed it would be worse in chaotic Italy.  Quite possible to
survive in the cracks if you were a young student, and lived like a pig, and
moved every month or two, and didn't have a car, but I didn't want to do that.

<p>

My look in March persuaded me that I could rent a studio in Monte-Carlo and
live unobtrusively for many months, without registering with the police.  Not
possible in Nice or Cannes, I thought.

<p>

Looked like I might even get a telephone, the wait being only a few months
versus over two years in San Remo!  And mail service was allegedly excellent.

<p>

I could live in a new high-rise, and have a car with non-Monegasque plates,
and eat in good places.  And if the cops came for me, I could move on; a
couple of kilometers in any direction and I would be in France!  Besides, I
had gone up to the Palace and talked about computers to Rainier's business
development man, an American, so I could always claim I had started out to be
a good boy.  In fact, I had.

<p>

About cars: I had flown out to Los Angeles in November of 1960 and driven the
Alfa back, with a ticket on the Pennsylvania Turnpike for going so fast the
troopers had to have me picked up at a toll booth.  Happily, they were so
taken with the cute scarlet Veloce that they only charged me with 80, although
we agreed I had lost them at about 110!  After I photographed my gorgeous wife
standing next to it with the Sutton House doorman Manuel, I put it in the
garage next to her Chev, and it gathered dust until I reluctantly sold it.
Paid the rent for some months, of course, but how I hated to do it!

<p>

Now I took the residue of that sale and went to an agency in Rockefeller
Center which sold automobiles to tourists tax free (sort of), for delivery
overseas.  I studied their brochure, worked over my hoard of motor magazines,
reluctantly put aside thoughts of Porsches and Mercedeses, and ordered a cheap
Simca Ranch Wagon, a three-door with a teensy engine and absolutely no
options, for delivery in Paris with "red" - that is, French tourist - plates.
Cost me just over $1400, total; those were the days!

<p>

I thought seriously about going by boat, but the nicer liners cost a lot
compared to steerage on Air France.  Besides, it seemed, oh, opulent.  In the
event, I took AF0700 on the Monday before Thanksgiving, November 27.  But as a
result of looking at sea travel, I found out how to send a foot locker of
books and papers (the very trunk I had bought for the same purpose to take to
Harvard by Greyhound in the summer of 1939) on the Hamburg-America line, and
forwarded to the Lotti in Paris besides.  For a third of the air freight
price, too - and arriving ahead of me.

<p>

As I write I am somberly reminded that 32 years and 11 months later I reversed
the process, and flew back to the U.S. from Europe with even less baggage,
also to start a whole new existence.  On KLM instead of Air France, though -
and I knew a lot more about New Mexico in 1994 than I did about Monaco in
1961!

<p>

My air log says in faded ink, "New worlds to conquer!" and "6-45" for
duration, but nothing about the food.  It had been my sixth eastbound Atlantic
crossing; the westbound KLM flight in 1994 was my 128th.  I landed at Orly
Tuesday morning.

<p>

The next day I found my way to the suburban Simca factory and took possession
of my new friend Ranch.  Shuddering at the skimpy shift lever and the yellow
headlights, but happy with the two-tone blue paint job, I drove back to the
Lotti, loaded my footlocker and ski gear and two big suitcases and elegant
first-class Air France carry-on into the back of the wagon, and headed out.

<p>

It was an open fall, and I enjoyed the leisurely drive.  I had no schedule any
more; the Simca factory had been the very last line on a long and complex
listing.  I knew there would be no problem with a hotel in Monte-Carlo, at the
end of November.  I spent two nights, including a rather lonesome
Thanksgiving, on the road.

<p>

I chose the Balmoral, many many notches down from the H?tel de Paris I had
greatly enjoyed in March.  They offered a low weekly rate, and after I
bargained in Franglais for a while, pointing out their restaurant was closed
until late in December and that they had no garage for my wagon, did even
better.  Actually there was street parking until the holiday English arrived,
and that was cheaper than under cover, and available 24 hours a day besides.
It turned out to be a good choice, and I stayed there until I was permanently
established.

<p>

Just before local closing time I tackled the PPT, which had an elegant office
on the boulevard des Moulins and seemed to do a big business in fancy Monaco
stamps (the currency was 99 per cent French, with an occasional Monegasque
coin).  Had to work in French, but with the Sutton House number written out in
advance, I managed to reach Elizabeth from B?ite Numero Un.  It would have
taken an hour in Nice; in Monte-Carlo, five minutes.  That part of my planning
was right, it appeared.  I gave her the Balmoral details; had written her from
the Lotti with confirmation about the Simca, but she had not gotten the letter
yet.

<p>

She broke in to tell me that a Jim Miles of Control Data had been trying to
reach me about helping them with a legal problem.  I groaned.  "That might
have been real business, sweetie, and I just missed it.  Well, call him back
and tell him to send a night cable to the Balmoral.  He probably won't, but
I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Give him the phone number too, but tell him the
cable is a lot more reliable."  We talked about Manhattan weather, and the
problem of walking a reluctant Deo in his raincoat, which had been my job, and
laughed edgily.  Tensions!

<p>

I had a talk with the concierge at the hotel.  He agreed to forward cables and
phone calls if I went on a trip (I was thinking ahead to Christmas), and said
the PTT was very good about such things.  "Also the instruments here in the
hotel are always working, Doctor; not like Beausoleil!"  He was referring to
the French area bounding the principality to the north [actually, only a few
streets north], which was a separate entity with its own mayor and police, and
inferior services.

<p>

In 1961 the Balmoral did not have a teletype, but in spite of it being a
Sunday the PTT delivered a long night letter next morning from Minneapolis.
Jim, who was the sales vice president for CDC but was chosen to get in touch
because he knew me, asked my terms to testify as an expert witness for them in
the upcoming trial of the Sperry Rand law suit, saying that my standing as a
"very well known" user would support their defense of the designs they were
working on, which the ERA branch of RemRand was claiming.  The whole shemozzle
is as dead now as Jim Rand, but it was a burning issue in 1960 and 1961.

<p>

I cabled terms, and hung about the principality more than I had expected to
see what would develop.  Turned out air mail to Minnesota only took four days,
so we were able to exchange contract stuff rather briskly.  And there were all
sorts of wonderful new experiences for me, both in the tiny town and out in
the countryside with Ranch, to keep me from biting my fingernails between
communiques.  We settled on $200 a day; the beancounters tried to beat me down
on the grounds of lower costs in Europe [1961!!], but I pointed out I had a
base in Manhattan to support, and had saved 'em initial ocean transport
besides.  Today it would be $1000 a day, I suppose - especially from a Monaco
base.  We closed the deal.

<p>

My major concern between CDC contacts was to find an apartment.  There were no
easily accessible listings: the window stuff in elegant real estate offices
was all sales, and at unbelievably high prices.  This was at just about the
high point of Onassis' presence in Monaco; he had bought out the Soci?t?
des Bains de Mer, which owned the Casino and most of the hotels and beach
spreads, and the flood of rich Greeks was at its peak.

<p>

The Grimaldis, the ruling princes, had controlled things since long before the
rich English had began wintering in the last century.  But times had changed,
and brutes like Onassis could buy almost anything, just as the Arabs were to
sweep up everything decades later.

<p>

Rainier, probably genuinely carried away by love rather than in calculation,
had found a solution: he had married lovely Grace Kelly, and her presence was
reviving everything the Monegasques valued.  She had been in the palace for
five years when I arrived, and was already much loved for herself, as well as
for having produced a male heir, and for helping the prince stick a thumb in
Onassis' eye.

<p>

To jump ahead a little while we are waiting on Control Data, I saw the royal
couple only a few times, and always in ceremonial roles - in the center stand
at the Grand Prix in May 1962, for instance.  But I joined the Scotch Club at
the Casino, and several times saw Onassis across the room, usually with
Callas.  Indeed, one night after watching Fidelio at the Nice opera, I
ventured up to his table to ask the wonderful woman who had sung the lead if
she would dance with me (she said no).  His bodyguards were not happy.

<p>

December wore on.  Encouraged by the CDC exchanges, and wanting to further
reduce my expenses (the Balmoral still cost more than I could afford on a
continuing basis, although the telephone and telegraph and concierge services
were valuable), I had found a real estate agency, and a studio apartment in a
R?sidence Auteuil, a tall skinny building whose view of the Mediterranean
would be cut off some day by a much larger structure already going up, but
with unbelievable slowness.  Elizabeth and I had watched our excellent view of
the bronze Seagram Building disappear behind an ugly new apartment, and the
latter had gone up a story a day as we agonized.  In Monte-Carlo, the
obstructing edifice was rising at about one story a month, and being
considerably downhill from my R?sidence would not be a threat for a year or
more.  But its presence was enough to discourage people from buying apartments
in my building, and I was able to rent, and even to rent by the quarter.

<p>

I knew from my overseas friends, and from a great deal of careful reading,
that almost no business would be done anywhere in Europe during the two weeks
or more of holidays.  I had planned from Manhattan to do some inquiries first,
or I would have delayed my own move until early January.  So I had come, and
now the Control Data matter had prevented travel, and the holidays were close.
I settled for the apartment as of January 1, arranged with the Balmoral people
to store my trunk and a suitcase, closed out my account with genuine thanks,
and headed off on December 19th.

<p>

I arranged with my well-tipped concierge that I would keep him informed of my
whereabouts, so that he in turn could have the PTT forward calls and cables.
He was to hold letter mail unless we agreed by phone he should forward it; I
had told Miles to use night letters "over the holidays" if he needed to reach
me.  The trial was tentatively set for mid-January, when there would be no
trouble with airline reservations.

<p>

I had hoped to ski, or even do some winter climbing, in the Dolomites.  But
the open winter meant not enough snow; Ranch and I drove to Cortina, and I
thought the scenery stupendous, but skiing was impossible.  I stayed one night
at the Alaska, and renewed my Courmayeur-type enjoyment of alpine lift riding.
But the town was empty.

<p>

The hotel people were courteous; they could see I would not stay, so they
tried to help me find snow.  "The Arlberg," was the consensus.  Dorothy and I
had been in Innsbruck, but I was nervous about the Hafelkar - like the runs
down from the Tram at Squaw, too tough for my abilities.  So I decided to try
St.  Anton, and to drive to it over the Arlberg Pass itself, which the Alaska
porter said was open (a bad sign!).

<p>

My maps, which were mostly Michelin, although later I would acquire a lot of
Italian Auto Club folders, suggested Bregenz, but it was a puzzle how to get
there from Cortina.  Looking at them today, I don't recall the route.  But
somehow, just a day or two before Christmas Eve, Ranch and I found ourselves
climbing the west side of the Arlberg.  There was snow; there was a stream of
traffic bound for St.  Anton, over the pass, and lots of skis and luges.  It
began to get dark.  At the very top of the pass road there was a small but
elegant-looking hotel and a sign identifying it as the Hospiz.  I had no
Austrian guidebook, but it looked interesting.  I pulled into the carefully
plowed parking area and went in.  The village, a tiny scattering of houses,
turned out to be Sankt Christoph; just a dot on my best map.  The latter
showed a major lift system, however!

<p>

I later found out the hotel had been booked for weeks, for the holidays, even
before the snow came.  But I was fortunate; there had been a cancellation by
telephone just a few minutes before, and when I presented myself at the desk I
got the small but pleasant single room.

<p>

In earlier chapters I skipped reluctantly over my ski pleasures at Squaw, and
just a little way back hardly alluded to the snowy glories of Zermatt.  So you
will not be surprised if I say very little about daytime excursions above the
Arlberg, using the major Galzig lift right across the highway from the Hospiz.
I will say instead that I had a wonderful time after skiing, when instead of
the hot wine of California or the Valais, I reveled in slivovitz, fiery Balkan
plum eau de vie.

<p>

The holiday festivities were continuous, and I made friends with a Gothenburg
couple and two German bachelors, who will appear a little further on in the
book, at sea level.  I taught the Twist (very poorly, need I say, my
IBM-cafeteria tango lessons having worn off) on the crowded dance floor.  It
was the OK thing with sophisticates in December 1961, and I had been to the
Peppermint Lounge in Manhattan only a few weeks before.  Got me several lovely
partners, but only for dancing, much application of sekt, German champagne, to
the contrary notwithstanding.  I thought of my lovely wife vegetating back in
New York, but not too often!

<p>

Then wonderful news: a long cable from Minneapolis was forwarded from the
Balmoral, and informed me that the altercation with Sperry Rand had been
settled, and that instead of my testifying at the trial, Bill Norris, the
chairman and CEO of Control Data, wanted to hire me to visit possible future
customer locations in Western Europe.  The message stressed confidentiality,
but pleased me no end by saying they were on the verge of a major decision and
wanted to move very rapidly.  Also Miles omitted the usual CDC attempt to go
cheap, and offered my $200 a day right out!

<p>

I had visited the gloomy St. Paul factory where production of the 160A and the
1604 was beginning, and Miles had tried to show me some of the new stuff
Seymour Cray had under way, but Surly Seymour had chased us ignominiously away
in spite of Jim trying to tell him I was a friend who wanted to help, not an
annoying customer.  I had talked to Norris, whom I knew slightly from his
secret life in Crypto, and at some length to Miles, about doing a tour to help
them decide about a European entry, and I had had hopes that it might actually
happen.  But after the Sperry Rand suit was settled, of course ... and now, it
was!

<p>

I have the airmail letter about the expert witness thing, forwarded from
Sutton House to the Balmoral, and I have a handwritten copy of the start-up
message.  It says:

<p>

Sending it collect was obviously not possible.  And the time difference being
seven hours, I was clearly not planning to miss my skiing.  The hotel's stamp
says 23.12.61 .

<p>

I was amazed to find they did not want me to come back to Minnesota and
collect papers, sign a contract, and pick up a cash advance [very important].
Instead we worked the telephone, and an agreement, in full legalese, was to be
waiting at the Balmoral (copy to Sutton House, where Elizabeth was waiting
with bated breath).  I was not sure yet about mail at my new apartment!

<p>

Still have my carbon of the draft.  I show altering the address to Monte-Carlo
from New York, and a correction back up to $200 a day (Jim claimed it was a
slip).  There were other problems, including expense matters: "All living
expenses shall be covered by a per diem of $25 for each day spent away from
basing point [my insertion], which need not be accounted for by Consultant."
I see I agreed with "Travel time at night or on Saturday or Sunday to be
excluded", which I would not do today.

<p>

The machines referenced were the 160A, 1604, 3600, and Cray's as yet
unannounced 6600.  The most interesting word in the six-page document,
however, was in the sentence "the name of the Company is to be retained [sic]
by the Consultant ...", by which the lawyer meant "withheld", or "held in
confidence" or some such.

<p>

Another section said that CDC had already looked at joint venture
possibilities in Europe (much to my surprise), but that any "general
observations of the Consultant shall be reported"!

<p>

I'm making it sound stupid, and it wasn't.  The material about what they were
looking for, probably verbatim from Miles, was right on.  They said emphasis
was to be on "large computers", which we had agreed to months before.  They
listed a fair number of applications ("technically-oriented markets") and
included "atomic energy areas", but shied away from cryptography.  Well, it
was 1961, although I'd guess Norris had been told years ago about Colossus;
we'll never know.

<p>

This is a good place to refer to the rather pointed conversation Hal Bergstein
had had with Bill about CDC plans, which was published in the December
DATAMATION under the stupid title "How to Make Money in Computing", along with
the first word that Seymour's powerful 6600 was under construction.  Both
items were extremely important for me, and Elizabeth faithfully forwarded the
magazine, which was waiting at the Balmoral for me to consult as I continued
negotiations.  I was Number Four on the DMN ever-fluctuating masthead at the
time, and my article about specifying, selling and supporting NORCs, LARCs and
especially STRETCHes ("Monster Marketing"), which had appeared in the previous
issue undoubtedly had confirmed Norris and Miles in their desire to recruit
me.

<p>

As soon as I had recovered from St. Sylvester, which was the Austro-German
name for New Year's, I packed my souvenirs and my skis and headed back to the
Mediterranean.  There had been a fairly heavy snow on the 2nd, and I couldn't
get enough traction with Ranch's skinny little Parisian tires to climb the
last few meters and over the pass summit, so I turned down and drove very
carefully in the opposite direction; took an extra day.  No chains in
St. Anton!

<p>

There was no problem keeping busy back in Monaco.  I had to sort out and
supplement the scanty and very French furniture and equipment in my studio,
which meant for instance buying linens and such.  I got a Peugeot [yes, same
company] coffee grinder, found a shop which had a great selection of coffee
beans and confitures, learned how to shop in the Beausoleil market for blood
oranges and other interesting foodstuffs I had not bought in Manhattan.

<p>

The challenge for the next months was coffee cream; with all my reading in
French and English, it still took me weeks to find out that I had to ask for
cr?me fraiche liquide (plain cr?me fraiche was like sour cream back in
New York).  Moreover the dairy in Monaco-Ville made very little, and only one
or two stalls at the Monte-Carlo (not Beausoleil) market ever carried it - and
it often was soured when I got it back to my tiny kitchen!

<p>

But glorious croissants were fresh every morning at my bakery by the foot of
the steps down from my parking area, and only 64 centimes apiece.  When the
cream had not soured, I made myself wonderful Continental breakfasts.

<p>

In the next two weeks I not only settled in, met my concierge, learned how to
get my letters, and all the other artifacts of my new arrangements, but
finalized the CDC contract.  I still have an exceedingly curious
parchment-like [quasi-Ozalid] copy of the major hand-written letter I sent
Miles, which starts by saying I was not waiting to find a typing service in or
near M-C.  It ends:

<p>

  15.  If you can scrape up anything on the 6600, please send it.  Hal
  Bergstein is my principal source, and I'd rather have some specs
  directly ....

<p>

  If these items make sense to you, you can have a revised agreement in my
  hands here by the 25th or so.  Please cable before that, though - same
  address - so I can start making my dates (probably in Turin and Milan)
  for the 29th and 30th.

<p>

  Thanks for the proposition - I'm real anxious to go to work on it for you.

<p>

                                                  Sincerely,

<p>

It was dated "16e janvier 1962", and was almost certainly the first letter out
of my new address.  Alas! it turned out later that no one in Minneapolis had
the faintest appreciation of my Frenchiness - especially no one who was going
to be shipped over.  It was during this time that I began to laugh sadly about
Grosch's Second Law, although I had been a case in point myself with Tom
Watson in December 1957:

<p>

        "No one gets a foreign assignment who wants it."

<p>

That's double-barreled; on the one hand, if one wanted as I had in 1957 to
have an overseas job, the desire was an automatic disqualification; on the
other hand, the one who was selected and shipped out willy-nilly never wanted
to go.

<hr>
<p>

I had gotten the cabin fever pretty completely out of my bones in Sankt
Christoph, and learned to trust the funny little ranch wagon on the long road
back.  I missed the vigor of my scarlet Alfa Spyder, the elegance of the
silver 190SL, and the bulk and ferocity of the huge American convertible that
had preceded them, but clearly the tiny Simca was a good choice for my 1962
needs.  It was with a light heart that I replaced the ski gear with a slim
leather suitcase full of clean shirts, and an attach? case bulging with
address books and blank CDC call report forms, and set off to answer Norris'
questions.

<p>

He and his middlewesterners had made it triply hard for me.  They had given me
almost no information on what they were going to offer.  I realized some
months later that they were nervous about the 1604A, since the 1604 had really
been designed on Jim Rand's premises, that they had not yet delivered many of
the small 160As or even begun production on the 3600, and that Surly Seymour
(as I had already christened their resident wizard Seymour Cray) had not let
anybody except Bill Norris himself know much about the 6600.

<p>

Second, Miles had demanded that I not identify Control Data as my client.
Indeed, he had asked me to pretend I was just collecting dope for an ACM or
DATAMATION article.  I told him I lied very poorly, and that most of the
people I planned to visit would want to feel there was something more in it
for them - another possible supplier, say - than just adding to my rolodex
["database" hadn't been invented in 1962].  Or adding to my writing income!

<p>

He used this as an excuse not to furnish me with much material about CDC.
After all, if I was not to identify with them ....  In my usual suave fashion
I told him not to worry; most people I visited would assume I was working for
Burroughs, since the B5000 had just been announced in North America.  Miles
was not amused.

<p>

Third problem was a complete lack of overseas support.  Control Data didn't
have the faintest trace of a presence in Europe: no agents, no bankers, no
customer inquiries recorded.  It turned out later that several nuclear outfits
like Atomenergi outside Oslo had written for information about the 3600, but
this had not been put together for Norris or Miles when they talked to me.
Used as I was to centrally controlled IBM, I was amazed at the small amount
and poor quality of CDC staff support.

<p>

So I was on my own; well, if the Minneapolis guys had ever had passports, or
known beans about Philips or Fiat, they wouldn't be paying me to make a Grand
Tour!

<p>

Before the Simca pulls away from Re?sidence Auteuil I ought to tell about
those address compilations.  I had culled the dope about all my foreign
contacts, from my astronomer correspondents in the Thirties to the man from
Aldermaston De Carlo had had me leak the STRETCH story to in late 1958.  I had
a clipping file on European computing landmarks.  I had a weird SRI report on
computers overseas, compiled by an Everett Calhoun, who knew almost nothing
about computer usage, and precious little about the hardware, but was a whiz
at report writing; an economist, I judged.

<p>

I brought along my membership lists from ACM and the IRE.  The Brits had been
in business for five years, and I had joined the, correction, The British
Computer society almost immediately.  Trouble was, I needed installation
information, not the shop addresses of engineers or college addresses of
professors.

<p>

Manufacturers like IBM and Ferranti had just what I wanted; CDC presumably had
a similarly confidential list of U.S. installations and near-installations.  I
was undoubtedly safer, I mused, and certainly cheaper, than industrial
espionage!

<p>

There were amusing photographs, pages of concise computer descriptions, and
even an appendix about large-machine service bureaus ("computer time-hire"),
in a fine little book the DSIR, Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research, had brought out in London in early 1961.  I had already studied it
closely.  But of course it covered only England.  It contained the first data
distinguishing the English Electric KDP10 and the new KDF9 however.  There was
a German equivalent, and a second edition of the latter, and I had those too.

<p>

But above all I had a secret weapon, the plans for which I had unearthed in
Rome while Elizabeth and I were honeymooning five years before.  Under UNESCO
auspices, a bunch of third-rate Italian bureaucrats and second-rate European
academics had founded the ICC, the International Computation Centre.  The idea
was to beg some fairly powerful machinery from bedazzled manufacturers like
IBM and ICT and Siemens, and offer cheap time on it to needy professors from
Burma and Liberia and Paraguay.

<p>

Nobody bit.  A superset of academics had kicked off IFIP, as I've described
earlier, and although also an appendix - vermiform, for sure - of UNESCO, the
Federation had ignored ICC and its empty ten thousand square foot EUR machine
room.

<p>

Bureaucrats never give up and absolutely never go away.  The tiny ICC
secretariat sent out survey sheets, compiled a looseleaf notebook of
"international" computer centers, and sold a few dozen copies.  They struggled
to update it, and I was on the mailing list!

<p>

The compilation was so unbalanced as to be laughable.  It had all the computer
installations down to desk calculators, in Belgium.  It had a budding lab in
Zagreb.  But it had nothing at all about the huge shops in California tin
airplane factories, nothing about Sandia or Hanford, nothing about ERMA.
There were pages about university shops.  Johnnie von Neumann's offspring were
still mentioned, and SEAC and SWAC - and they had mined the stories in early
MTAC, and the discontinued ONR listings.

<p>

My carefully up-to-dated copy covered Austria one hundred percent, Britain ten
percent (51 installations), and the U.S. less than two percent (84 outfits).
On the other hand, I knew a great deal already about North America and the
U.K., and very little about Austria.  I prized the stupid thing above rubies.

<p>

Indeed, anxious to get even newer updates, I had put a Rome visit at the very
top of my travel plan.  I needed to do half a dozen Italian calls anyhow; I
simply opted to do them first.

<p>

The ICC compilation had listed a naval installation at La Spezia with an ERA
1101, <i>mirabile dictu</i>.  I sent them a telegram from Monaco, saying that
I was passing nearby "on my way to visit major computer installations in
Rome", and would call for a few minutes on the 29th.  I addressed it to the
Scientific Director, SACLANT ASW Research Center, and did not give a reply
address.  On Sunday the 28th the Ranch and I headed east along the Riviera di
Ponente.

<p>

La Spezia is half way between Genoa and Leghorn, and indeed is the only harbor
between the two; we had only 290 kilometers to go, but there was no
<i>autostrada</i> in 1962; the drive was Sunday-exciting, even in January.
There was no Italian Michelin yet, either, but I had heard of the Jolly hotel
chain, and quickly checked in at the local one, although the reception was
startled to have me appear without either a reservation or any useful amount
of Italian.

<p>

Once embarked on such journeys, I used the concierge network for each next
step.  The Jolly man, who of course spoke good English, called his counterpart
at the hotel I had chosen in Rome, and reserved for me.  The Rome concierge
phoned ahead to Milano when the time came, and the latter, to London.  All
language and the-hotel-is-fully-booked problems disappeared, and the phone
charges and my generous tips were going to be paid by Lucky Jim Miles.

<p>

The scientific director of the Navy facility turned out to be a Dr. John Ide,
and his computer man was a chap named Wood.  They were actually employees of
Sirimar Corporation, which was a commercial offshoot of Penn State.  They ran
the operation for the Striped Ones, and helped the latter fend off the
seductions of NATO, which indeed took over the facility two years later.  Ide
was an oceanographer, so I pulled Tactic A ("I'm just one of the boys") on
him.  After I had run through Maurice Ewing and Frank Press and the Watson Lab
punched card machines, and he had marvelled at those dear dead sound channel
calculations, he was putty in my hands.

<p>

Problem was, he really didn't know how the 1101 had gotten to Italy or when.
"It was here when Sirimar took over," he stated.  And what he really wanted
was a Woods Hole-type oceanographic ship, not a 1604A.  Years later I found
out it had come from the National Security Agency!

<p>

I was interested to hear that Brother Wood was bothered by motor generator set
problems, just as seven years before I had suffered from my GE air
conditioning add-ons, not troubles with the 701 itself.  He indeed
contemplated a data reduction bottleneck if Dr. Ide ever got his yacht, and
before I checked out of the Jolly I marked him down as a good 1604A prospect.

<p>

Nobody in the whole shop seemed to realize they were in Italy, and only a few
kilometers from the best antipasti in the country, let alone wanted to help me
on my mission.  Their bosses were four-stripers in Naples, but their hearts
and gustatory preferences were in Pennsylvania!  I told them how good the
steaks were in Florence, but they weren't listening.

<p>

About Tactic A, which I used in eighty percent of the 48 calls on this tour: I
posed as a Real Computer, an ex-scientist with a good doctorate, a pioneer
large-installation manager, a fellow IBM victim (or IBM insider, if the
visitee was a Grim Gray Giant enthusiast).  I was not a pollster, not a
reporter, not a salesman - just One Of The Boys, if perhaps a little more
ancient and a little more famous than most.  A lot of them knew me, and had
even passed through the Watson Lab or WHIRLWIND or Evendale or Phoenix, or
heard about von Braun's shop (it was in the ICC compendium) or about C-E-I-R.

<p>

I said I had clients back in the U.S. "who hope to introduce their big new
machines internationally", and had hired me to feel out the market.  It flew
nicely - and indeed, quite a few anti-IBMers guessed Burroughs.  Few guessed
Control Data; at least the big shots at Univac and Burroughs and National Cash
were known to have passports!

<p>

The Ranch and I went on down through Pisa that afternoon, slowing to fifty
klicks for the tower, and turned inland toward Rome.  Today the autoroute
would turn off above Pisa, but we did not pick up the then-under-construction
Autostrada del Sol until after Florence.

<p>

The last 250 km. went quickly; we were late for the early evening traffic, and
drew up amidst the Ferraris and the Rollses at the Hassler entrance about
nine, fashionably in time for dinner.

<p>

I called next morning at INAC, as the Applied Mathematics Institute was now
known.  Picone had retired, and his successor Aldo Ghizzetti was in Paris
romancing UNESCO (on behalf of ICC, of which he was de facto head, I was
told).  But Vacca and Ercoli welcomed me delightedly, rehearsed their more
recent experiences with the old Ferranti machine, and filled me full of
Italian background information and a good choice of gossip about Ferranti
Manchester.  I was able in return to tell them that Kelly Gotlieb was not
satisfied with the IBM 650 that Toronto had put in in 1958 to replace the
sister Ferranti, and was angling for a Big Scientific: say a 1604?

<p>

That let me bring up Control Data, without saying I was involved with them,
and I was not surprised to have Roberto say that while Cray was revered by the
designers at Olivetti, no one expected a Minnesota firm so tangled in AEC
security to ever come to Italy.  I described the 3600 and the 6600 and made
Paolo's mouth water.

<p>

I took Vacca to lunch, and found he was about to go over to a new Italian
subsidiary of the LfE, Laboratory for Electronics, in Massachusetts, and hoped
to be the director (he had found his visits to Cambridge confusing).  He said
Ercoli was bound in a more academic direction, and implied that with the two
of them departing, the old One Star and the ancillary computer operations
would soon be abandoned.  "The universities will offer services," said
Roberto.  "Milano is in bed with Univac, and Pisa with Olivetti and Bull."  He
implied both the academics and the salesmen would regret it; I made copious
mental notes.

<p>

Olivetti was offering an ELEA 6001, designed by the amazing Mario Tchou, to
all the university shops.  It was about like an IBM 1620, Vacca said, and he
had recommended a unified group around a 7090-size machine.  I guessed that
his reluctance to pass on details about the 6001 ("Roberto [Olivetti] will
tell you all about it when you see him") was due to his having signed a
nondisclosure form - and he was going to go on working in Italy, not
emigrating.

<p>

In my trip report I said "1604-type" instead of "7090-size"!

<p>

The other item in my report, which I had already entered in my country-notes
for the big final Letter To Norris was that INAC worried about the shortage of
trained computer people: hardware and software, high level and medium.  The
educational system wasn't turning out a fifth of the entry level men (and
virtually no women) that would also be needed, but on-the-job training could
help there.  The Banco di Roma had started up a 705 installation, and on IBM's
advice was recruiting internally and externally for trainees, but such a
one-application shop didn't need many seniors, and IBM was loaning two or
three.

<p>

It had been a friendly start in an important country.  The La Spezia boys
hardly counted as Italian, but INAC was central, at least for CDC.  When I got
back to the lovely room at the Hassler, I still had time to check on the
Raytheon affiliate, Vitroselenia, which von Braun's gang said were helping the
military with a sounding rocket program - suborbital, that is.

<p>

I talked on the phone to a Dr. Greco, who was most unaccomodating.  I asked
him to refer me to someone in the Air Ministry, and he said "IBM already knows
all the people there"; obviously thought I was still wired.

<p>

He had a 1620 on order, but his site was in Sardinia.  Good grief!  "We used
Alabama youngsters in Huntsville," I laughed.  Not possible, he said, "Even
Napoli has problems".  I figured the CDC boys might sell him a 1604A in a
couple of years, providing they shipped a suite of missile programs with it.
Ex-Sardinians from Lower Manhattan with NYU degrees would be a plus.

<p>

Vacca went with me to visit a Dr. Benzi of the C.N.E.N., the nuclear energy
administration.  He was planning a machine (I guessed another of the
ubiquitous 1620s), and did not want to recruit until after its arrival.
Really!  Even Roberto was startled.  I tried to put him on to the computer
operation at Harwell, but could see his eyes glazing over.

<p>

And I did indeed drive down to EUR, the exposition area, to find out how the
ICC was doing.  A poor type named Mussard had been named director, and was
doing his directing from Paris; Ghizzetti was head of the governing board, and
apparently the only one that counted.  In his absence the redoubtable Annie
Seggiaro ruled the empty roost.  She remembered me from her mailing list.

<p>

They had had a major pitch from Philco.  A fellow named Mann, whose trail I
was to cross a dozen times in the next weeks, had tried to interest them in an
S2000.  If he had offered the machine free, and maybe a few Philco people to
run it, it might have worked - but the cupboard was bare.  My trip report says
"a dismal visit".

<p>

The afternoon was much better.  I drove to Frascati and visited the national
laboratory of the C.N.E.N., already a major collaborator with Berkeley and
Livermore, and CERN in Geneva.  A Dr.Turrin and several assistants told me
about their computer experience.  They had started by buying time on the
University of Bologna 650, cast about for 704 time outside Italy, hired their
own 1620 last August, and were already up to eighty hours a week.

<p>

My notes say Control Data would need to "speak physics" to get in - and that
IBM Italia emphatically did not.  Also, "Service imp." [underlined three
times].  "At least a 3600, in 1964."

<p>

I don't remember where I had dinner; I had checked out of the hotel, and
probably ate rough.  But I remember vividly the night's adventure.  The Simca
and I stole furtively back into Rome, found a dark loading dock around behind
the Stazione Termini, and drove fearfully into an end-loading box car - ah,
goods wagon.

<p>

Abandoning my light blue friend and the box of loose brochures that was
beginning to fill up, but clinging to my attach? case and my pretty valise,
I found my way to the first class sleeper cars and went dubiously to bed.  At
crack of dawn, I was in Milano.  <i>Incredibile!</i>

<p>

I did this car-sleeper maneuver several times that year, for Control Data and
on my own account.  It let you drive your own car, but do overnight train
journeys.  Mostly it was used by vacationers, over routes operated only in the
summer; more than twenty years later, I did s'Hertogenbosch/ Ljubljana with
Mazda, wife, and Pekingese!  But a few business routes kept going all year,
and my friendly Thomas Cook rail compendium knew about them.  And, though I
didn't tell Minneapolis, it was fun!

<p>

About that brochure box in the Ranch: I collected printed material everywhere
I went.  It went to swell my big archive of IBM machines, ten years of
clippings from BUSINESS WEEK and, lately, DATAMATION - and conference
proceedings worldwide.  I had stuff from my Tokyo and Sydney adventures, from
my short struggle with ITT, from C-E-I-R.  European friends sent me stuff from
their first meetings, which had started in 1953.

<p>

You wondered about commercial equivalents.  Someone in IBM, for instance,
probably had a copy of every single piece of paper I had socked away - and a
huge bundle of proprietary information, carefully shielded from RemRand, Uncle
Sam, and customers.  I had never, in a decade of trying, been able to get on a
mailing list for BUSINESS MACHINES, the internal publication.  Only after
moving to Europe, and flashing my Monte-Carlo address, had I finally managed
to get the monthly IBM World Trade newspaper, and then only through the
friendly offices of Don Pendery, who had just been shipped to World Trade
Europe in Paris.

<p>

The difference was the retrieval mechanism.  For old disciplines like medicine
and law, and say organic chemistry, the semantic confusion was reduced.  But
in a wild, frantically evolving trade like computing, with intentional
upheavals of the current jargon almost monthly, a professional archivist was
lost.  I had an imperfect but completely personal mental "list" of my
holdings.  It would have been great to have an imaging capability, a
tremendous hard disk, a laptop of Pentium capabilities - alas, they were over
three decades away.  I made do with Hercule Poirot's "little grey cells".

<p>

Milano was familiar to me, where Rome had been novel.  I had had the only
completely tailor-made suit I ever owned, fabricated out of magnificent dark
silk by a shop across from La Scala.  I had stayed several times at the
now-vanished Continentale, and had had lunch with Roberto Olivetti and his
Chinese-Italian chief engineer at Aldo's, close to the new Palazzo Olivetti in
the Via Clerici.

<p>

I admired the Galleria (as did architects back in Houston).  Roberto was
cordial, even after he understood I was scouting for an unnamed competitor.
He showed me around the beautiful office building, still not three years old.
The only equipment on display was a transistorized desk-top called the
Programma 101.  "We have an ELEA center in Ivrea [the Endicott of Adriano, his
father] and will soon have several university installations."

<p>

I asked him about the 9003, which was aimed at business, and was pleased when
he was honest about "troubles with the programmers". I asked him about the
story that they were mostly Canadians.  He looked at me owlishly and said,
"Fosso vero [I wish it were true]"!  I laughed dutifully and said they were
probably lost among ten thousand typewriter mechanics in Ivrea.  "Pisa," he
smiled.

<p>

Well, it was nice.  I noted that the 6001 was somewhere around the CDC 160A,
and with dubious peripherals; clearly, though, it was aimed at the ubiquitous
IBM 1620.  Norris And Co. would not be interested in the 9003, and I didn't
have a brochure to send them anyhow.

<p>

That afternoon I made an unusual call at the Centro di Calcolo Elettronico of
the University.  The director was a Dr. Cavedon, who was on the RemRand Italia
payroll.  He had just weeks ago put magnetic tapes on his RRUnivac SS90, a
machine well below the 1620 or 650.  Turned out the university gave one-third
support, and the Univackers put up the rest and sold services.

<p>

He told me about Fiat, which had an interest of some sort and operated larger
RemRand equipment in Torino, where I was going tomorrow.  He startled me by
claiming Olivetti had a 9002 installed "upstairs" in the Via Clerici building,
and that they had started programming courses for customers the year before.

<p>

I wrote a long report on this minor visit, giving a list of the applications
they were handling: "Larger machine soon.  Already at 14-16 hours a day.
Personnel less a problem here."  I suggested a 1604A or 3600, joint with Fiat.
Perhaps I was somewhat carried away by the fine air-conditioned lab, built
into a red sandstone building "half as old as time".

<p>

Elsewhere there was a big 7090 with ten tape drives, the most advanced
scientific installation in Italy, and a certain target for Control Data even
if they were reluctant to spread out over Europe.  But I knew quite a bit
about this bunch, which was in Ispra, up toward the lake country, and CDC had
great connections via Sid Fernbach and such.  What I really wanted to see was
Fiat, about which I knew almost nothing.

<p>

This involved my first business visit to Torino. I put up again at the
Principi di Piemonte, a magnificent but stuffy member of the CIGA chain, and
went out to explore the restaurants and sniff the white truffles which
perfumed the downtown arcades.  In the morning I drove to Mirafiore and hunted
up the Fiat research laboratory.  My host was a Dr. Bruno Provero, who wanted
me to come back soon and meet the research director, a Dr. Bono.

<p>

Provero and his staff had had a successful CPC installation, but now ran most
of their bigger stuff at the university in Milano.  They used a dialect of
FORTRAN called F-2 and wanted me to help them find big-machine time in
northern Europe that "could read our programs".  On Univac mag tape?  Or as
CPC decks?

<p>

They were unfulfilled ALGOL fans, besides.  Under "Salesman's follow-up
action" I wrote, "These people are very proud of themselves, and very sure
they are right - just like GM.  Actually they are babes in the woods, even in
Italy ..."

<p>

I wanted to see the gigantic factory, which was the most advanced in Europe in
1962, and full of automation.  No soap.  I drove back to Linate, the
short-haul airport, found a garage to provide covered parking for a week, and
flew off to London.

<p>

Digesting my Italian experiences was not easy - and if I had started with,
say, Germany I would have been swamped.  Big machines were arriving, but
mostly for banking and such.  The scientific ones that Control Data did well
were just coming to the nuclear establishment, and nowhere else yet.  But the
market was small, and Italy was very different from Minnesota!

<p>

Two months later I wrote in my final report to Norris:

<p>
<blockquote>

<u>The Country</u>: In many respects the Common Market boom has been strongest
and most sustained in Northern Italy.  Even Germany's "miracle" has levelled
off slightly.  But the Italian situation is peculiar; grinding poverty still
exists in the south, corruption is still rife (note the scandals about the new
Leonardo da Vinci airport near Rome), the social-political balance is still
uncertain.  Italy, more than perhaps any other industrialized country in the
world, is a country of extremes.  It can be a good market for huge computers -
indeed, some of the extremes favor such a possibility - but it poses many
problems.

<p>

And many of these, I repeat, are social rather than technical or
financial. For instance, highly personal management: the giant corporations or
nationalized industries are each headed by father-figures of international
stature.  These men make all major decisions, down to levels far below the
ones that concern CDC.  And they have neither the time nor the inclination to
learn much of the burgeoning computer technology.  They do not rely on
consultants; they do not listen to academic advice in the very few cases where
such is available.  Promising young men, crown prince types, are now sent to
the fancier business schools (IMEDE, the Harvard-Nestl? Foundation
experiment in Lausanne, for instance); their influence will be felt, but not
immediately.  Even more than most of Europe, top management is an intuitive,
secretive, restrictive function.

<p>

On the DP side there are already many over-enthusiastic orders reminiscent of
the early 1950s in America.  But the tools of science do not seem to benefit
from such contagions.  Thus the Pirelli skyscraper does not automatically
imply pure research at the company laboratory, and a 7070 at Alitalia does not
imply an interest in OR.  If a Mattei (ENI) or a Faina (Montecatini) or a
Valletta (Fiat) were to develop a passionate interest in our brainchildren, as
Wenner-Gren once did, almost any development might follow.  But such men are
hard to reach.

<p>

Many Italian businesses - banks and shipyards as well as airlines and power
companies - are controlled by IRI (something like our RFC), which is even
larger than the state petroleum trust, ENI.  Cooperation and coordination
flourish in such an atmosphere, in spite of the obvious quasi-socialistic
pattern, and these could lead to giant planning enterprises of 6600
magnitude. So far they have not, largely because advanced economic and
econometric thinking is entirely lacking in the major universities.  And there
are no Rand Corporations or Brookings Institutions along the Po !

</blockquote>
<p>

I then did similar sections on trends, competition, probable customers,
service centers, programming, and CDC entry.  The whole thing reads very well
indeed from a Nineties perspective.  Looking back at the results, however, I
realize that Norris had not yet seen the humanistic light - on the road to
Damascus, I joked years later - and the rest of his troops looked only at my
estimates of numbers and types of machines, and for which customers.

<p>

It was not only Italians who lacked vision!

<p>
<big><b>A MAN'S BEST FRIEND IS HIS COMPUTER</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; BUT A PEKINGESE IS A BETTER LAPTOP</big>

<p>

In the next chapters of the book you will meet computer friends - or at least
old acquaintances - with numbers like 650 and 1103 and 7070, and names like
CPC and ERMA and STRETCH.  But there will be other computers mentioned, mostly
European, that you do not know.  In order not to extend the Casts of
Characters, lists including the ones that may be new to you are given at the
end of pertinent chapters, and these are summarized at the end of Chapter 50
(pp.457-59).  Some were great; some were even popular; almost all are now
forgotten.  Most of them were Best Friends to some eager men and women.

<p>

My exchanges with Jim Miles had left me with the distinct impression of haste
(which I understood) and of a desire to minimize my expenses, or at least the
number of days I would charge them.  And I was aware of how much needed to be
covered in England to bring my knowledge of big computing there up to date,
and do a reasonably complete survey for Control Data.

<p>

My adventures in the Savoy Grill on behalf of C-E-I-R were recent, of course,
but had been directed at people, rather than machines and markets for
machines.  I had looked at the ITT affiliate the year before, but it was a
very small part of the English computer scene, and of interest only as
competition for the CDC 160A.

<p>

So I had a lot to do, and had to cram it into one week.  Obviously sauntering
into the Savoy Sunday evening and starting to make arrangements the Monday
morning was not the way to go.  So from Monte-Carlo, after moving into my
little apartment in January, I had written off to E.T. Goodwin, the head
("superintendent") of the maths division at the National Physical Lab, and
asked him to help.

<p>

Charles, as everybody called him, was a kind and helpful type (many years
later I would hold a similar job at the Bureau of Standards, and tried to
remember to be as helpful; "kind" was more difficult).  Also he was above the
competitors; it seemed like dirty pool to ask Stantec or Ferranti to route me
around.  Sandy Douglas owed me for the C-E-I-R job, but he would want to know
more about my, ah, sponsors than they would want me to tell him; yes, I'd
certainly see him, but not put myself in his hands.

<p>

Well, Charles came through magnificently.  I still have the chart, worked up
on funny NPL computing paper (demy legal cap, he owlishly informed me) on
which he had arranged much of my visit and displayed options for the rest, in
neat former-desk-calculator-operator style.  Down the side he had eleven ams
and pms, and across the top the initials of ten men he had contacted for me,
and there was an elaborate key and a page of notes.  And he called me after I
arrived, to make sure I had it all, and would indeed come out to see him the
next morning!

<p>

Flying up from Milano had not been easy.  There had indeed been fog in the
Channel ("Continent cut off"), and Alitalia had put down at a primitive
airfield near Bournemouth [!!] and bussed us to central London.  But Charles
being welcoming on the telephone was restorative - and a superb meal alone at
Kettner's, with a burgundy called Wine Of The Infant Jesus, and a spectacular
armagnac, finished the job.  (I avoided the Grill because I expected to host
several dinners there in the next days.)

<p>

I took a green doubledecker bus out to Teddington and found Goodwin's
old-fashioned office, near the DEUCE room which had housed the Pilot Model ACE
when I first visited in 1954.  He had arranged for Stan Gill to drive over
from Cambridge, so I was able to talk to three highly informative experts in
the first one-eleventh of my visit: a wonderful start.

<p>

Three, because Charles had brought in Jim Wilkinson, his chief numerical
analyst and even then the world's best practical matrix computer.  He was to
get the ACM Turing Award for his contributions in 1970, and made the Royal
Society a little later.  Wilkie was a big user of NPL and university
equipment, and had visited frequently in the U.S., so his opinions were
current, and took account of the 7090, and what was available and promised in
CDC country.

<p>

Charles still had the Pilot Model ACE, now over nine years old, but relied
heavily on a successor machine, the DEUCE, which had evolved from the ACE and
had seen moderate production at English Electric in Kidsgrove.  He described
that company as very good, but "reluctant to really go in heavily", which
surprised me somewhat since they were selling a business-oriented machine
called the KDP10 and promising late-1962 deliveries of a scientific
counterpart, the KDF9.

<p>

"Ah," said Wilkie, "they're doing the KDF9 themselves, but they got the KDP10
from RCA in the States; it's a 501 with British components".  I wanted to know
where they got their transistors, but nobody at NPL knew.

<p>

They had put magnetic tapes and old-fashioned mercury delay lines on the later
DEUCEs, but both K [Kidsgrove] machines had core memory.  The scientific
machine sounded about as powerful as the Control Data 1604A, but at least a
year behind in deliveries.  I could see how NPL would revel in a 1604A, let
alone a 3600.  But would Her Majesty's purse spring for American machines when
it was unwilling to buy my friends a KDF9?  "For the military, perhaps - and
you know there is a STRETCH on order for Aldermaston," sighed Goodwin.

<p>

Gill, who still had close connections to Cambridge, said that the University
Grants Committee was being pressured "from Whitehall" to buy only British
computers: ATLAS instead of STRETCH, KDF9 instead of 7090.  "You'll hear about
it everywhere," he smiled.

<p>

All three wanted to hear about "my" STRETCH, and marvelled at American crudity
(Charles called it "forcefulness") when I described how I had been served
walking papers in the lobby of the Jack Tar.  Wilkie had read about my
tongue-in-cheek creation of the Polynesian Information Processing Society and
was concerned about the disappearance of Hastings, whose strange creations he
admired.

<p>

And while they all seemed to know as much as I did about U.S. computing, they
hung on my every word as I described Tokyo and the JEIDA Building.

<p>

The morning went swiftly.  Stan was quieter, both by nature and because he was
going to take me back to town and fill me in on his new connection, but
Charles was bubbling with the arrangements he had made, some of them with
people I had not met.  We ate in the canteen [ooogh!]; I refrained from doing
Kettner's for them.

<p>

Looking back four decades, I deeply regret not talking with them about Turing.
He had killed himself only three or four months before I came to NPL in 1954,
but I did not know how much he had contributed to ACE - and COLOSSUS was an
absolute secret until 1974.  I thought of the man as a pure mathematician; if
I had read his mother's 1959 memoir I would have realized he was an important
machine designer and a bench electronicker.  But she knew little about his
crypto work - and no one I knew had read her book until after the Hodge
superbiography appeared, or at least mentioned her obscure effort in my
hearing.

<p>

After the curtain went up on the ULTRA secret, I realized I had been
surrounded for years by people who had worked at Bletchley Park, who had links
to NSA long predating mine, and who had really pioneered digital electronics:
Goodwin and Michie and especially Turing in the U.K., and I.J. Good and Gordon
Welchman in the U.S., and several Americans at NSA.  In 1962, I hadn't a clue.

<p>

I no longer remember what kind of car Stan drove, nor whether he had pleasure
in such beasts, as I did.  We arrived in Newman Street in central London,
having talked vigorously about computing personnel all the way.  He felt there
were severe problems at top and bottom, but reasonable supplies of programmers
(as I had, he relied heavily on women) and maintenance men.

<p>

He had just been appointed Director of Programming Research at Ferranti, and
was de facto head of their London Computer Centre.  He had a typically
European connection continuing with Cambridge, and did not offer anything
about salaries and such, but clearly it was a major career move for him.
"Will you need to move to Manchester or London, Stan?" I asked.  Not decided,
he said.

<p>

The Centre had two PEGASUSes and one SIRIUS, with an ORION coming.  It could
not begin to afford an ATLAS, but would have commercial access to the
University of Manchester machine.  I had told him I was being funded by "a
competitor or some such", so we talked about the U.K. situation in general.
He did say service work was profitable for Ferranti and had top management
support, and that he did not need to "sell".  I asked if enough walk-up
business appeared without salesmen, and he said there was value in problems
"on their own merits".  My trip report said, "Means it gives a private view of
the shortcomings of one's own machine."

<p>

We went back to the education thing, and he emphasized that fancy men and
women got picked off for university before the new polytechnics could get
their hands on them and teach them any down-to-earth practices.  The same
thing happened in the U.S. later, but the broader river of young people
flowing through the diverse American school systems kept the result from being
so important.

<p>

We parted reluctantly.  I saw him a dozen times later, notably at the
Stockholm IFIP meeting with his son, but I never felt closer to him than in
his new 1962 office.

<p>

One of the men Goodwin wanted me to meet was completely new to me.  He was a
D.G. Hawkins, manager of the Central Electricity Generating Board Computer
Centre in the CEGB headquarters, Gordon House, in Greencoat Place.  I poked
around for mutual friends or experiences, and turned up CIGRE and Pier Abetti
(who had the 705 in GE Pittsfield).  Can't remember if the E in CIGRE stands
for "Electricit?" or "Europ?ens", but GR stands for "Grands R?seaux",
the giant nets of high tension power lines.  Pier designed and built big
transformers; CEGB used `em.

<p>

I can't do better than quote my entire report, including appendages:

<p>
<blockquote>

PROSPECT FOR: Next, a second 7090; THEN two 3600s, or a 6600 if there were
several others about.

<p>

REPORT: This is another very good prospect.  Operates gigantic closed shop of
150 people, including two punched card installations and PACE analog.  Very
nice physical setup (for London).  A hard rock ops man (reminds me of John
Lowe) with power engineering and OR history.  No DP to speak of.  Very
skeptical hardware and software deliveries of Ferranti - says he personally
quashed ATLAS order (I think very likely true).  Likes big resources IBM but
resents high prices.  Has not been subject old California-style Poughkeepsie
highhandedness!  Says petroleum people do reasonable transportation (OR) work
but he would do much larger ones [sic] on sufficient machine.  His systems
group also going toward real-time control; this is largest integrated
electrical distribution and generation [system] in WORLD by considerable
margin - all UK!

<p>

COMPETITIVE INFO: Has 709, almost phased out; 7090 one shift, expanding; wants
disc file and another 7090 for security of operation.  His standard: 98%
availability of at least one machine:

<p>

ACTION:
<ol>
<li>Give him early dope on 3600 and 6600.  He told me the 7094 announcement is
out.
<li>He's not interested in #1 of any machine, nor in #1 of US imports even if
many in US.
<li>Attending TVA-Ontario Hydro meeting in April somewhere in Tennessee.
Pick him up?  Don't disclose my lead unless you want to.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>

Reminded me of my good years in GE Evendale.  Hawkins was doing something his
bosses wanted badly.  He had sensible and powerful superiors in a huge, rich
outfit.  And unlike among the U.K.  bankers and department store owners, and
Whitehall types, technology was his bosses' bread and butter, rather than a
mysterious threat.

<p>

Charles had arranged a dinner date for me with Jack Howlett.  I took him down
to the Grill and plied him with smoked salmon and Carlsberg, and beef, and
burgundy.  We hit it off immediately.  He was running a shop like one of mine,
at Harwell, with a building under construction and staff expanding and a big
ATLAS coming.  His part of the AEE was the newly reorganized research arm, and
pretty well outside security; indeed, he could play games with Oxford (I noted
in my trip report that Fox was resisting).

<p>

He hoped that the smaller ATLAS Buckingham was getting via the UGC would break
the ice with the academics.  I disguised my strong doubts by saying Buckingham
should get "a disinterested 'manager' [a Rex Seeber] who would want to serve
the colleges equally"; Jack agreed, and then admitted he was on the selection
committee for such a person.

<p>

We talked about Los Alamos, which was beginning to show faint signs of wanting
to do unclassified work, and that brought up Livermore, and their plans to get
a Cray machine.  Needless to say, I plugged Howlett as a major candidate for a
"6600 or better" in my report, and pointed out he was to get his machine at
the end of 1963, or even later; there was time.

<p>

I knew better than to recommend sending Surly Seymour over to meet Howlett; SS
regarded even the sexiest users as annoyances, and most of them as
contemptible.  He didn't even want users to change their problems around to
make more sophisticated use of his brainchildren - just that they go away and
not bother him.

<p>

They ahemmed us out of the Grill when the after-theater crowd thinned; Jack
sent me a note saying he had never spent a more pleasant four [!!] hours.  He
remains a monument to U.K. big-computing today.

<p>

Next morning I was in Aldermaston, the AEE weapons design center.  Glennie, to
whom I had illegally leaked the STRETCH specs in early 1959, introduced me to
his boss Dr. Corner, and we had a great time talking ATLAS versus STRETCH,
Ferranti versus U.S. IBM and U.K. IBM, and looking at their handsome 7090.

<p>

My report says:

<p>
<blockquote>

"Corner is very conservative but extremely well informed and willing to talk.
They feel English problem is lack of interest in computer approach at top
managerial and government level - 'their' Sir Wm. Cooke almost only exception,
and perhaps petroleum outfits - Shell, BP."

</blockquote>
<p>

I added that Aldermaston was the "best prospect in England if STRETCH flops".
I had worried what to say about the C-E-I-R orders, but found they knew more
about the situation (even about Jack Strong, and the backup 7094 order, and
the building on Wilshire) than most computing buffs in the U.S.

<p>

I was not an old friend of Glennie's, and British reserve would have been
disturbed if I had gone into the gory details that had titillated Charles
Goodwin and Stan Gill.  But word gets around!

<p>

On the train back to London I relaxed.  Things were going well, thanks to old
relationships.  I set the Savoy hall porter to work on telegrams northward,
and on Scandinavian hotel reservations.  And I skipped one meal.

<p>

Next day David Wheeler came down from Wilkes' lab in Cambridge to spare me the
trip.  I took him out of the hotel for lunch, and found confirmation for my
Monday and Tuesday stories but not too much new stuff.  He said Maurice, who
was in the States at the moment, had tried to get the UGC to give him an
ATLAS, had turned down a possible KDF9, and was sort of planning to assemble
his own machine from [donated?] Ferranti parts.  I summarized Wheeler's own
concerns as:

<p>
<blockquote>

"down on ALGOL for publication, let alone usefulness in actual machines;
skeptical character recog. work in UK, and machine translation everywhere;
still enthused over microprogramming ideas .... Thinks 6600 simplicity better
than complex look ahead".

</blockquote>
<p>

and added that Cambridge will have access to Buckingham's small ATLAS and
Howlett's bigger one.  Apparently all they had at the moment was a
much-modified EDSAC.  No wonder Stan Gill had drifted away.

<p>

The University of London Computer Unit was within walking distance, and
Dr. Buckingham was eager to talk Wednesday.  He had a Ferranti MERCURY with
"limited store", and expected to get his ATLAS "in 12-14 mo.", which seemed
optimistic to me.  He told me a third of his support was from the university,
only a third [I was surprised] from the Grants Committee, and a third from
British Petroleum.

<p>

I reported "Gossip (not from interviewee) puts latter at ?600,000 for five
years, or $336,000/yr." - don't remember who told me.

<p>

He was planning a new building, which given the speed of 1962 construction or
remodelling in Central London made his opening date even less likely.  I
wished him well.

<p>

Now, Sandy Douglas was waiting for me in his office in the Kingsway.  We had
much to recap; he knew Robinson had fired me, but not - he claimed - why.  I
had been told in Teddington that Robinson had recently put one of his own
friends in over Douglas, but also not why.  The stories about the week before
were true; 52 "staff" had been dismissed.

<p>

The new top man was Maurice Kendall, a famous figure in British statistical
circles who would give class to C-E-I-R Ltd., but who didn't know one end of a
computer from the other.  Herb Robinson had come out of those circles, and
cast back because as a renegade - Arlington, Virginia - and worse, a
Yorkshireman, he yearned for the Oxbridge patina.  It was dumb, and Sandy was
too formidable a politician for it to last.

<p>

I wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>

 ".... - they share IBM Newman Street 7090, have about a shift of work
(largely LP [linear programming] - customers carefully not identified).  This
is steady; they might get own machine when they have a shift on IBM machine
already sold; 7094 announcement important because much of the LP is
double-precision floating work, so 7094 is maybe five times 7090 .... at 20%
extra rental."

</blockquote>
<p>

"But won't you be able to buy 7094 time from IBM?" I asked.  He said it wasn't
clear whether they had a 7094 coming, and grumbled about unimaginative local
management.  "Maybe you can get `em to hire away Maurice?" I cracked.

<p>

We agreed to meet at the nutty Cardiff meeting of the BCS in September; it was
the first conference outside the London/Oxbridge ambience, and we were both
skeptical.

<p>

"Sell him a 3600 before he orders his own 7094," I advised.  "But watch out
for finances; Robbie is tricky."

<p>

Les Fox had come down for lunch Friday, at Goodwin's suggestion. I scolded him
for not bringing his attractive wife Paulene, and pointed out I had reserved
on the Embankment side rather than the business-lunch Grill hoping she would
come.  He had a lot to say, negative about the UGC which scanted him because
he had a computer (his Ferranti MERCURY, working 168 hours a week).  Good for
ten years, they told him!

<p>

He took a chance and ordered a KDF9 for "about ?230,000", intending to do
charge-backs, even inside the Oxford colleges and labs.  I was puzzled by his
emphasis on service costs, but now realize they came out of his day-to-day
budget, the smallness of which also kept him grossly understaffed, rather than
from what we now call a "capital" budget.

<p>

Anyhow, he was paying for two-shift maintenance on his present machine,
planned ?12,000 a year for the KDF9, and said Ferranti wanted ?25,000 to
service an ORION, and IBM was "even worse".  Considering much lower wages in
the U.K. I suppose that seemed a lot, and I passed it on to Miles; it seemed
cheap to me.

<p>

The Royal Aircraft Establishment (Farnborough) had a late model DEUCE, but
only with paper tape.  The head of their computer activity, a chap named
Hollingdale, had come out of NPL, so Charles had lassoed him for me.  He came
to dinner at the Grill, and we split a monster Dover sole, partly because it
was Friday.

<p>

We traded names; I did "One Of The Boys" as of the engine business, and he
said Rolls Royce was Number Two in computer use, behind De Havilland, and
mentioned Val Cleaver.  He told me English Electric also had an aircraft
division, and that the RAE was going to give that bunch one of the nine KDF9s
it was ordering from the computer side of the house!

<p>

He was doing mostly test data reduction and performance tabulations, and
yearned for graphic output.  His people used a primitive DEUCE assembler,
would prefer ALGOL, but were going to settle for FORTRAN (I told him he was
lucky).

<p>

After I had worked over Goodwin's "availables" chart I had called Chris
Strachey, who had been my second choice for the C-E-I-R job, and asked to see
him.  Since the idea of taking a pizza had not yet dawned in Europe, I brought
a bottle of excellent claret [alas! he didn't open it].

<p>

Since he was only a machineless consultant like me, I did not have the same
criteria in discussing the scene.  I can give his qualifications best by
quoting the body of my report on the visit:

<p>
<blockquote>

Strachey is the original NRDC computer designer, and among other machines did
PEGASUS for Ferranti.  He does a great deal of classified work - lately on
EMIDEC 2400, which he likes largely because it has a large core memory (16,000
words).  He views English software [note 1962 use of word] with a jaundiced
eye - lack of support, also lack of top management appreciation.  Doesn't
expect a major upturn in English computer or data processor orders for 5-10
years, "until the younger men get into the Establishment".  No opinions about
the Continent.  Likes McCarthy (MIT) work on novel function-oriented
programming languages [LISP?].

<p>

Does not admire ATLAS - too gimmicky, as we would say.  Thinks it will work
but will have little software.

</blockquote>
<p>

Reads pretty well after thirty-six years!  Strachey was terrific, and not at
all Surly.  His premature death in 1975 diminished our trade, and worldwide.

<p>

Before the evening calls I had casually walked in to the English Electric
Computer Service Centre, also in the Kingsway.  They heaped me with brochures
and told me there were 18 firm KDF9 orders in addition to "a great many"
KDP10s already installed.

<p>

They had a late model DEUCE with a KDF9 coming, and claimed to be so busy they
were shipping work to Kidsgrove's KDP10.  Since the latter was
chalk-versus-cheese incompatible with the DEUCE, I doubted the yarn.  The
technical man, a Mr. Davis, said EE was doing ?5 million a year "in this
field".

<p>

What a week!  And it wasn't over yet; somehow or other I had tripped over Arch
Johnston - probably in the Savoy lobby.  He was the head computer coordinator
for Socony Mobil International, and had his office only a few blocks from my
Manhattan apartment.  We got together for a few minutes Saturday morning.

<p>

He had four 1401s in London, Paris, Hamburg and Geneva [?]; punched cards in
Italy, Nigeria "etc.".  He was heavily involved with IBM because of the 7090
in New York, and said if data communications improved he would put in a 7074
somewhere.  My notes say, "This is important for Europe" - data
communications, that is - and recommended a New York or St.Paul salesman talk
about the problem with Arch [don't think they did].

<p>

I checked out of the Savoy; for all those lavish meals, and six nights in a
decent room, the bill was ?142/2/8, not counting two quid for the hall
porter.  Gawd!  It would be two thousand today, and a twenty quid tip!

<p>

I took a wonderful London taxi out to Heathrow (the hall porter had bought my
ticket, of course) and headed south for Scandinavia.

<hr>
<p>

"South to Scandinavia" at the end of the last chapter was correct.  I wanted
to get to Copenhagen over the weekend, but first I flew down to Milano and
reclaimed Ranch, from a garage near Linate.  I drove with great pleasure back
into town, put up at the Continentale again, and relaxed in Italian anonymity.

<p>

I did a classical seafood antipasto at Da Alfio on the Via Senato, but went
dutifully back to my room and wrote up my last English reports and notes.  In
the morning I counted my various monies and started my funny expense card for
the new week ("Carried 20NF, 40sh, 100SF, 10DM, 20100 lire, $2152.06" - must
have changed my last English money to Italian at Heathrow, and the U.S. was
mostly a letter of credit).

<p>

The doorman produced my insignificant Simca with faint disdain, put my two
bags in back, and saluted me off.  I drove gaily north through Como and
between the lakes.  The weather was good, and I beat most of the Sunday
traffic.  I went up as far as Chiavenna - the great Spl?gen Pass road at
the end of the valley had been closed since late October, of course.  I
brooded over my maps, and the unattainable heights.  I don't think the San
Bernardino Tunnel had been opened by 1962, and anyhow that was out of the next
valley west.  The hotel had packed me a box lunch with a big bottle of San
Pelligreno; I enjoyed it.

<p>

My little excursion over, I dropped down to Como again and crossed into
Switzerland.  My objective was a loading ramp at Chiasso, where I put Ranch to
bed in another goods wagon.  This time we had a major car-sleeper adventure;
we would span the entire country, go into Germany at Basel, hitch onto the
DBB, and end up next morning in - Hamburg!

<p>

Today you have to start in German Lorrach, across from Basel, and the service
only runs four summer months.  But in 1962 it ran all year, and there was a
Swiss restaurant car for dinner.  The big problem is to be sure you have
reservations; I had solved that by having the Savoy send over to the London
office of the Swiss railway and buy the tickets for Ranch and Human - ah,
Dr. Human!

<p>

Next morning the two of us drove to the Hamburg airport, bringing back
memories of 1954 (for me; it was a first for the Simca).  The locality being
much freer from pilferage than Linate, I parked my little friend cheaply in
the open and flew away to Copenhagen, not realizing what tides and tempests
would intervene before I would see the blue miniwagon again.

<p>

I had arranged to meet my host for dinner; not yet having experienced his
gusto, I was a little startled when he showed up at my hotel with two young
associates.  He swept us off to the Belle Terrasse in Tivoli, bought rounds of
drinks and a wonderful meal and wine and beer and liqueurs - and picked up the
tab.  What an introduction!

<p>

This was Niels Ivar Bech, founder, director, chief engineer, head salesman and
fund-raiser for Regnecentralen, the Danish computer enterprise.  His young
disciples were Peter Naur and J?rn Jensen; Naur was helping him with his
IFIP tasks (Bech was program chairman for Munich) and Jensen was doing a
software package for his GIERs.

<p>

My call report began,"What a ball of fire this boy is!"  I had been startled
to find he had made eight GIERs in a year, and shipped all but the
Regnecentralen unit, on which software and "an impressive microprogramming
experiment" [my wording] were being tried out.

<p>

Bech said that for Denmark it was IBM or local talent (him).  Brits were
nowhere, Siemens coming up but "far behind in software", and the universities
would lose their few good people to such companies.

<p>

"Lucky youngsters," I smiled.  Bech laughed hard but his disciples were
shocked, even after I told my Watson Lab and Evendale stories.

<p>

I reported to CDC that Bech expected four hundred 1401-and-up machines in
Denmark in five years, up from forty in early 1962.

<p>

His Number One machine had an Analex printer (good) and Ampex 400 tapes (not
good).  He still had the old DASK, which was a Danish copy of BESK, the
Swedish one-off, and used excellent paper tape equipment for input and output.
Jensen was unhappy that they had no tape-to-mag-tape converter.  I said cards
were the way to go, and was trampled on; turned out they had also designed and
built the RC2000 paper tape unit!

<p>

The acronym GIER stood in Danish for Geodetic Institute Computer, and the
Number Two the institute got in 1960 was used until the mid-Seventies.
Parenthetically, my introduction to Control Data (when I could run up the
window blinds) led to Bech installing a 1604A in August of 1963 for service
work, while he was developing his RC4000 computer.

<p>

I will be writing later how I returned to Regnecentralen at the end of May,
but this is a good place to tell more about Bech, who was a Danish Zuse, the
discoverer of a dozen great young people, and a vivid and exciting human
being.  Just as I did not appreciate Turing until I read the Hodges biography,
so I did not grasp the full abilities of Bech until I was given a copy of his
memorial volume in 1978.  My wife Nancy and I, and the Peke Ginger, were
guests of Aarhus University for a week, and Christian Gram made the
presentation.

<p>

Bech had died in 1975 at 55, and his disciples and admirers immediately
produced the wonderful book.  Gram, for instance, did the chapter on
Regnecentralen and the Danish universities.  In paper covers, with dozens of
illustrations, and with English chapter summaries, the book is a joy to look
at.

<p>

The man's drive toward a unified Scandinavian computer enterprise failed and
the manufacturing side of his institute dwindled away, but the service arm
mutated into a powerful governmental center called Kommunedata I-S which did
the data processing for all Danish towns and provinces.  We will meet it at
the OECD in 1969.

<p>

All my heroes were innovators.  Not necessarily in computing: Watson Senior
did management and salesmanship, and Neumann did jet engines, and von Braun
spacecraft.  Most of them were leaders, but not all; many were warm human
beings.  Bech was surely a leader, and much loved.  I wish I could have known
him better.

<p>

One almost forgotten innovation was Bech's interest in Eastern Europe.  He
sold a GIER to the University of Warsaw - Turski's first good machine, I would
guess - and a small RC4000 to a Polish chemical plant for process control.
Regnecentralen pushed into Budapest, Prague, and especially Sofia, but the
effort slackened after his death in 1975.

<p>

Another powerful Regnecentralen thrust was pioneering and effective support
for ALGOL.  That annoyed me in 1962 because I disliked its provenance and its
professorial originators.  But I noted that Naur's version ran on DASK and was
about to run on GIER, months and months ahead of the academic counterparts,
and applauded Danish skills.

<p>

I recommended to Miles and Norris that they consider Copenhagen as their
Scandinavian center because of Bech and Regnecentralen, "But the importance of
locating the maintenance people near their first customers points to Stockholm
or Gothenburg."

<p>

There was another comment in the Competition section of the Danish chapter of
my final report which makes me feel badly as I read it today: "IBM gets orders
because - well, because Bech may trip up, or vanish as Mario Tchou and Ralph
Meagher did, but the Watsons go on forever.  So even at 6-8 times GIER prices,
there are plenty of 1401 orders."  Sssaaah!

carried me off to dinner.  I would have checked back into the hotel and stayed
another day, but by this time I was nailed to a schedule by railroad
reservations and prior appointments.  I could see I had tapped into a
free-flowing aquifer of Scandinavian (and indeed, continental) information.
But alas! I had to be at SAAB in the morning.

<p>

We stretched the dinner out, and then adjourned to the Faience Bar and kept on
talking.  Naur wanted to know about his English friends and about the IBM crew
back in New York; Bech had heard about the C-E-I-R venture in London and
wanted an update.  I carefully avoided mentioning Japan!

<p>

Only an hour before train time Bech loaded us into his rather nice car and
drove me the three or four blocks to the station, ignoring my protests as I
gathered was his wont.  Swearing to keep in touch, we parted at the entrance.

<p>

I reclaimed my bags, extracted the London-bought tickets, found the proper
spor and sleeping car, and climbed aboard.  I had a single, of course, and the
berth was down, in an older car than the Swiss one I had ridden up from
Chiasso.  Chamber pot!

<p>

It was half an hour to departure, so I was able to walk around the wonderful
old high-arched station, admire the lovely girls and women, and buy some boxes
of Berg marzipan as ongoing gifts.  When the train pulled out I sat fully
dressed waiting for The Big Event: it was my first night train ferry ride, and
I was armed with an English enthusiasts' book called something like "Train
Ferries of the Western World".

<p>

The train, the book and I were to be loaded, well after midnight, onto a ferry
primarily designed to cross the ?resund (several times a day, but only once
at night).  Pushed on by a Danish shunter and pulled off by its Swedish
counterpart, the night sleepers did not have to be divided; there were only
three or four.  The book said the daytime trains had to be split; there were
parallel tracks.

<p>

I didn't dare look around the boat itself, but I did watch wide-eyed as huge
turnbuckles were connected to several eyes on each side of each car and
tightened down with crowbars.  The car ferry book said that operation "in
northern waters" continued until rolling of more than 15 degrees was
encountered; now I could guess why lengthwise bunks were not used in European
sleepers!

<p>

These operations across major water gaps in the rail network had begun before
WWI, continued - believe it or not - during both wars, and are still operating
in many places today.  The one across the English Channel, the night Arrow
into Victoria, which I rode a few years later, has been discontinued; the one
across the sound between Denmark and Sweden still operates, and will do so
until the tunnel/bridge between Copenhagen and Malm? is inaugurated in
1999.

<p>

Thrilled and wakeful, I climbed back into my bedroom, took off my clothes at
last, and rolled with the ferry.  I had forgotten about Jim Miles and Bill
Norris.  Minnesota had nothing like this.

<p>

The attendant got me off very early in Link?ping; the schedule provided for
most passengers to breakfast in Stockholm, many kilometers up the line.
B?rje Langefors, who had visited me twice in the U.S., met me with two
juniors and carried me off to the hotel he had arranged, and fed me a fair
copy of an English breakfast, with - to my amazement - scrambled eggs: good
ones.

<p>

SAAB stood for Svensk Aeroplan Aktiebolaget, and the company was prouder of
its fighter aircraft than of its then rather unattractive automobiles ("best
in the world in climates like ours", I was told).  My host was a chap named
Dr. Lindstr?m, head of the Electronics Division; under him Langefors ran a
major computing shop, servicing mostly the airplane boys.

<p>

There was a division marketing man named Kuentzel, who proudly told me they
were on the verge of announcing their new D21, and that I would be the first
American to see the production machine.

<p>

I was amused to hear they were buying Philips cores and stringing their own
memories; Bech was buying complete core planes from Plesseys.  I reported this
and much more to Control Data, and added "nicely built, ultrareliable from
military and user experience".

<p>

Gave me a chance to see the new Facit high speed paper tape punch and reader,
and to lift a discreet eyebrow at Potter magnetic tapes, which I had never
seen except at the Joints, in the U.S.  They gave me a tour of the old SARA,
which I faintly remember was related to BESK, and their own D2, which
Langefors had had to use for two years while yearning for his D21.  Somebody
admitted there was a 7070 hidden away in plant accounting, doing loathsome
things like payrolls.

<p>

They said cagily the price would be "much cheaper than American", meaning IBM.
Kuentzel said the IBM rentals - the 1956 agreement to sell machines had hardly
affected IBM Sweden - were nearly double the U.S. rates, and I wondered very
secretly to myself what CDC would do in that respect.  Not double, it turned
out at CERN in later years, but marked up quite a bit.

<p>

A luncheon had been laid on in my honor at my hotel: a full smorgasbord, and
with much aquavit and toasting.  I had already heard that the famous display
was getting too expensive for most restaurants, especially at lunch, and was
delighted to find the word had not reached the, um, hinterland.  I made a
short speech of thanks, comparing the feast favorably with Italian antipasti
and praising the D21 effort.

<p>

I don't know to this day who was the prime mover behind SAAB's entry -
somebody above Lindstr?m, I'm sure; perhaps Tryggve Holm himself.  What
they needed was not Plessey core planes, but a Niels Bech.  In the next decade
they fiddled with the idea of a Scandinavian enterprise, probably goaded by
Bech and his people, and lured by his Eastern European dreams.  SAAB had
resources; it was no GE, but any outfit that could design, build and sell
really good fighter planes in the world market could have challenged IBM and
Univac.

<p>

Half the troop waited around while I checked out, and escorted me to the
afternoon Stockholm train.  Nice!

<p>

I had reserved from London at the Grand, and due to the good offices of the
Savoy was given a fine room facing the harbor and the palace.  I walked for
miles - ah, kilometers - around the town center, not yet torn up by the
"improvements" of the next two decades.  It was cold, but the snow had been
neatly cleared away.

<p>

I had been avoiding IBM offices and computing centers, but I had known the
original Swedish Applied Science rep Arne Lindberger when he was training at
the Watson Lab in 1949.  I quote from my trip report:

<p>
<blockquote>

He was out of town, but I got the royal treatment anyhow.  DATAMATION is
widely read!  There are 5 7070s in, two more later this year; "very many"
(equals, I hear, over 40) 1401s in and on order; one 7090 in Defense
Establishment.  Also, big joke, an RCA 501 on the ground floor - big windows -
of this office building!!  Service bureau with some DP work, says Ahlgren
[manager of the IBM Data Centre].  He has a 650, with 1401 coming.  IBM
[Lindberger?] trained its own systems analysts, now uses them to in turn train
customer analysts.  Has manuals for punched card machines in Swedish; wishes
it had same for 7070 - 7090 but gets along without.  Feels each 7070 needs
30-man organization.  Has a time persuading DP customers of this [in 1962?
I'll bet!].  "Technical customers no problem; train themselves" says
L?nnquist [marketing manager].  See little hazard from British machines or
RCA or Rem Rand; some from SAAB and Facit.  Has no printed dope yet on 7094;
prob. true.

</blockquote>
<p>

They fed me a magnificent lunch at the Stallm?staregarden, just out of
town, and decanted me at the Grand afterwards.  I left messages for Arne.

<p>

I referred in my final report to the Matematikmaskinnaemnden, whose
Wenner-Gren Center I staggered off to in the late afternoon.  This was the
Computer Board that built BESK years before - a larger version of Bech's
operation.  I wrote, "The latter [Danes and Norwegians] are free to put funds
they earn back into their own developments; in Sweden the service bureau
income from BESK goes to the government, which may or may not pass it back
.... in the form of a larger budget next year."  So said the boss, a
Dr. Dopping.

<p>

Uncle Sam made me do the same thing with the Bureau of Standards 1108 six
years later; great way to smother the Bechs and the Grosches!

<p>

The Savoy hall porter had fixed me up with a sleeping car reservation for
Oslo, and a hotel.  I'll tell about that snowy adventure in the next chapter,
including a flight back into Sweden.

<p>

I got to Gothenburg in the very late morning Friday [16 February], due to
ferocious weather, and saw immediately that onward travel arrangements had to
take precedence over my earlier local appointments.  Floods had closed most of
the bridges across the Elbe, and heavy rains had damaged the runways at the
Hamburg airport.  Poor Ranch was undoubtedly hub-deep (my concierge got
through, with great difficulty, and reported no major problems in the
parkings).

<p>

I changed my ticket to fly that evening to Hannover, and asked SAS
(remembering past good performance) to see that I somehow was transferred to
Hamburg afterwards.  "Many other customers are affected, sir; not to worry,"
said the young lady.  But I did.

<p>

For one thing, the carbon copies of my first 21 call reports, from which I
would have to construct half my final document, were in a folder in Ranch,
along with brochures and such.  Even if my little wagon survived rising
waters, the flimsies might not!!

<p>

Putting these grim thoughts aside, I went off to my postponed meeting at the
Chalmers.  This was at the ADB Institutet [Data Processing Institute] of the
Chalmers Tekniska H?gskola, where I looked forward to a reunion with a hot
academic, K-O. Tuvlind.

<p>

I had met him when he had relay machines, now replaced by two ALWAC IIIEs,
locally called WEGEMATICs.  Gothenburg was a shipbuilding town, and Tuvlind
serviced the towing tank researchers of his own polytechnic, and structures
engineers at the Foundation for Shipbuilding Research nearby.  I was
impressed.

<p>

He was also a mine - ah, tank - of information about machines, as such user
managers always are:

<p>
<blockquote>

This is first place in Europe that has been favorably impressed by Philco.
Also very knowledgeable about RCA 601.  Dubious of [Swedish] resources, even
SAAB D21; does not like IBM and does not feel English firms will follow up
promises.  "Rem Rand does not exist here" he says.  Also says RCA 501 in
Stckholm would sell time if properly managed, but is being used only as a
showpiece.  Will probably go IBM next if he can get rid of his inexpensive but
unamortized "WEGEMATICS" ...

</blockquote>
<p>

I hit an unexpected novelty in his shop: a down-to-earth experiment in
computer-assisted medical diagnosis [!!!].  The Varnamo Lasarett [clinic?] had
already made six thousand human-doctor diagnoses, and Tuvlind was processing
the matching 266-question patient questionnaires "machine-diagnosed by various
programs in an attempt to maximize agreement with reality" - a 1962 expert
system experiment!

<p>

I had met the Reuterskiolds at the Sankt Christof hotel, and promised to call
on them if I got to Gothenburg.  That was of course before I knew about the
Control Data adventure, and I called them from Copenhagen to ask if I might
have a short business visit at the Swedish Shipping Association office, and
then come to their apartment and relive St. Sylvester.  After the weather did
me in, I begged off the interview but was told to be sure to come to the
apartment, where "a few friends were gathering to celebrate Friday" - I still
suspect it was to meet me, but Reuterskiold was too suave to put it that way.

<p>

Anyhow, with only an hour or two to plane time, I found myself welcomed by his
lovely wife and half a dozen handsome couples, all eager to tell me about the
storms around Hamburg and hear first hand about my Japanese trip (which had
been prime chatter at the Hospiz).  I loved it, and loved the hors d'oeuvres
and the Linie aquavit [across the equator and back, before bottling].  But in
the end I had to scuttle: a wonderful ending to my Scandinavian tour.

<p>

When I put it together later I ranked Sweden as second only to Germany for a
Norris entry: ".... only the British know more about computers than these
people.  The Germans have so much more potential business I have to put them
ahead .... [but] this would make a neat northern outpost".

<hr>
<p>

In the previous chapter I disappeared from Stockholm and reappeared in
Gothenburg two days later.  What happened was that due to the geography of
that part of the world it made better use of my time and CDC money to go up to
Oslo at that point in my tangled itinerary, and to switch from lovely or at
least exciting trains and ferries to air travel.

<p>

I flew into Fornebu late in the afternoon of Wednesday February 14, and put up
at the Bristol as arranged by the Savoy porters.  Even then, over thirty years
ago, prices were amazingly high, but I gritted CDC's teeth and went out solo
to Blom's for dinner.  This was I think the very first time I had had gravlax
in Scandinavia, having been persuaded to try it first at Scandia on Sunset in
Los Angeles (a five minute walk from my 1960 C-E-I-R "office"!)

<p>

I had sent introductions by letter, and cables later, to the national
computing center Regnesentral, but drew a humiliating blank when I showed up;
no one admitted having heard of me, or to have seen my communications, and
when I gave up the receptionist was reluctant even to call me a taxi.  First
such business in 26 visits, which looking back from hundreds of such
arrangements and failed arrangements in later years was an excellent ratio.

<p>

I boarded a strange ultra-wide suburban railcar in a fairly heavy snowstorm -
part of the weather ravaging Hamburg, although I didn't yet know it.  This
took me to the Institutt f?r Atomenergi in Lillestr?m, which in spite of
the peaceable name was primarily an attachment to a military establishment.
They had a big Ferranti MERCURY, which because of security I was not allowed
to see (of course I had British brochures and programming manuals already).

<p>

My introductions, from Stan Gill in London, were to Jan Garwick and his boss
Tor Haavie of the institute, who nevertheless did most of their work for the
weapons boys.  They were startled at how I had been repelled at Regnesentral,
but I had to refuse most of their offers of help because of my departure for
Gothenburg next morning.

<p>

They first told me about their own needs and those of the KDRE, Royal Defense
Research Establishment, next door.  Turned out they were planning to buy a
really big KDF9 for about $2 million, which made them a solid prospect for one
of Seymour's 3600s, or even for a cut-down 6600.

<p>

The major problem seemed to be maintenance under security.  If I could have
made a sales pitch for CDC instead of talking vaguely about "a new company on
the European scene", I could have pointed out that what they thought of as
heavy restriction was child's play to anyone involved with NSA - about what it
took to get through to the visitors' desk at Fort Meade, let alone inside!

<p>

Their solution was to require their suppliers to train Haavie's own people to
maintain the computers, which worked poorly for the Ferranti machine and, I
warned them, would probably not work at all with English Electric.  They said
it worked well with a tiny ITT subsidiary "which made special equipment for
KDRE" (I knew from my abortive explorations inside European ITT in 1960 that
the special equipment was cryptographic; of such linkages are security
breaches created).  I said such accommodations were easier for small local
outfits.  They replied gloomily that EE was strong locally only in consumer
goods.  Like toasters, I asked?  Exactly, Haavie sighed.

<p>

Also they wanted two to three times 7090 speeds, which my memory of KDF9
brochures did not substantiate.

<p>

Getting onto software topics, Garwick (who was an irrecoverable ALGOL nut)
said he had a private agreement to do a compiler for "the largest Telefunken
machine", and that they had written him two days ago to suspend work.  In my
contact report that evening I said this had to be the TR4, and indicated some
sort of shakeup.

<p>

While we were gossiping a junior or a secretary was running down Kristen
Nygaard of Regnesentral, who seemed unrepentant about the morning, and
arranged for him to have dinner with me at the Bristol.

<p>

I thanked the two men for their welcome and their help, told them my client
would almost certainly be in touch "in a couple of months" and headed back to
Oslo.  It was pitch dark at four o'clock, and snowing; school was just out,
and the youngsters were skiing [!!] home.

<p>

Parenthetically, Garwick, who had much of Niels Bech's drive but none of his
suavity, emigrated some years later, ended up in the American Southwest -
White Sands or some such - and died at the beginning of the Nineties.  He and
ALGOL were each unfulfilled, and in Garwick's case it was a tragedy.  The KDF9
didn't do as well as it deserved, either.

<p>

Nygaard, whom I was to see several times in the next few years, was an
extremely expert programmer, and would have been another ALGOL supporter
except that he was about to embark on a competitive language of his own (this
would be SIMULA, of which more later).  I took mental notes of his ALGOL
denigrations for my own later use.  As for hardware, he told me the center had
a DEUCE, which I knew from Teddington, and that it was permitted to sell
machine time and a little consulting.  Looked like a potential 1604 customer
to me, and I so reported.

<p>

He also told me of a 650 in Bergen, in a cooperation named EMMA.  There are
RAMACs and 1401s on order in the DP community, he said, curling his lip.  I
was much more interested to hear him say the electric utility had ordered an
Elliott 502, which sounded sensible, and an order I had not heard about in
England.

<p>

I asked about the university (Oslo) and was told their people had not been
able to penetrate MERCURY security; sounded like another 1604 prospect.

<p>

In my final report I suggested that Norway could be a good customer country,
but that CDC would want to base "on Stockholm or Gothenburg, I think, or even
on Copenhagen".  What actually happened was that the European CDC venture
first ignored Scandinavia while operating out of Luzern and Frankfurt, then
opened expensive offices simultaneously in Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo, and
lost most of its momentum and a wodge of money.

<p>

In a later chapter I'll describe how one super-salesman swept up and down the
Norwegian countryside three years later and in one month sold more 1107s than
all the 1604s and 3600s Control Data ever planted in Nordic countries.  The
name of Seymour Cray opened a few doors, but Norris And Co. were poor at the
middle game and lousy at closing, especially in Europe.

<p>

When I set out on the Control Data mission, I expected to end up recommending
West Germany as the prime target for big scientific machines.  The mentions of
Germany as I toured my first five countries had not changed that expectation,
even those I heard in Britain, which clearly was well ahead of Germany in
computer sophistication.  So it was with much excitement that I embarked for
Hamburg - well, Hannover, as weather dictated.

<p>

When Dorothy and I had driven around in 1954 we had admired the amazing
recovery, enjoyed the food and the white wines, and goggled at the spire of
the Ulm cathedral.  My adventures while attempting to understand the European
ITT empire in 1961 had given me some feel for native hardware, the
Huntsvillers and my German visitors in the U.S. had told me something about
the user community, and ACM contacts and the UNESCO sessions said the
academics were hot in software [not true by my practical standards, it was to
turn out].  But I had not visited non-manufacturer computing operations, and I
looked forward to doing so.

<p>

First little Ranch and I had to conquer the elements, however.  SAS put me
down after dark on the south side of the Elbe, and bussed all the Hamburg
passengers - most of the load, of course - eastward toward the flood.  The
very last bridge before the East German border was still usable; I no longer
recall its name, but a 1990 atlas suggests Dannenberg.  Anyhow, we crossed,
and turned back toward Hamburg avoiding flooded highways and minor bridge
troubles.  The driver gave us a commentary in harsh dialect which I couldn't
understand, but I was so pleased at being back on schedule again I didn't
care.

<p>

My reservation was at the Vier Jahreszeiten, the first time I had stayed at
that wonderful hotel.  They were forgiving of my late arrival, and apologized
that they had to give me a suite [!] because the "inclement" weather had
hindered departures.  But, they said, since it was a Friday night the
restaurant would still accommodate me if I came down promptly.  Ah, did I
ever!

<p>

I've stayed at the Four Seasons, as the name means in German, perhaps a dozen
times over nearly thirty years, and eaten in the restaurant more often than
that.  Although I wasn't so fortunate on my first storm-blown visit, I
associate eating there with <i>Spargelzeit</i>, the white asparagus season; I
learned to enjoy that king of vegetables hot with sauce Maltaise or sauce
Mousseline, Italian style (fried in butter with parmesan crumbs), and cold
English style with melted butter or with a strange house mayonnaise full of
red pepper flakes.

<p>

Anyhow, on this first visit I had as I well remember a magnificent pork filet
with roast potatoes, and a light French red wine, and a rich dessert, and went
upstairs rewarded for travellers' diligence.

<p>

Next morning I reclaimed my poor neglected Simca from the airport parking,
left it at a nearby garage for maintenance and cleaning, and flew off to West
Berlin: my first visit.  Tempelhof, scene of the most dramatic days of the
Berlin airlift, still excited me, and the broken church at the center of
things excited me still more.  Also the Savoy had recommended the Hilton,
which I thought strange at the time, but now realized they had done so because
it was a social center for Berliners and foreigners alike, and not at all like
an American Hilton.

<p>

After checking in, I took a taxi to the Wannsee area and the Hahn-Meitner
Institute for Nuclear Research and introduced myself at the mathematics
"sector", which along with doing blackboard research operated a Siemens 2002
for the physics crew.  It was my first sight of major Siemens equipment, and
this machine also had new high speed Siemens paper tape drives (not as neat as
Facit's) and two IBM 727 magnetic tape units, which Egloff and Topker, the men
in charge, told me were going into production in Sindelfingen "very soon".

<p>

When I reported all this to Minneapolis, I explained that outfits like this
one, and the manifold Max-Planck-Instituts in various disciplines, were
funded by the government DFG, Deutsche Forschungs-Gemeinschaft, which gave out
computers - German-made if possible - along with operating funds.  Or loaned
them, in a sense.  The recipients were not permitted to take in washing, or to
use my old charge-back bookkeeping, and as a result much stupid academic work
got done and industrial and DP applications were shunned.

<p>

I also noted that "Junior staff was almost all girls, and not enough of them"
- a symptom of Berlin isolation - not knowing at the time that there were
exemptions from military service for young males, who nevertheless much
preferred Munich and Dusseldorf.

<p>

Topker said Siemens had "no real software capabilities", and that his people
were having to develop an ALGOL dialect.  I recommended Garwick, Nygaard, and
the English but was stiffly informed Bonn funding would not be available to
non-nationals even if they worked in Berlin.

<p>

This sort of thing continues even in EEC-reunified Germany, but seemed to me
in 1962 and still seems in 1998 less serious than the wall [Wall?] between
Academe and industry (let alone commerce).  In the U.S. hungry professors work
for computer companies and in aerospace, or start their own businesses or
consult for Washington or whatever, and flit back to a better academic job
when they feel strong again.  Bright industrial and business types reverse the
sequence.  Great gobs of know-how, and not a few trade secrets, get
distributed across the economy, and lots of new ideas for research are
planted.

<p>

Nothing like that has ever been dreamed of in Germany.  At most, a minor
eddying between universities and institutes, and between the very fanciest
industrial research labs and those institutes, takes place - one percent of
the U.S. traffic.  If the Herr Doktor Professor were to leave his enormously
prestigious chair, he could never dream of returning; if a tenured type in New
Haven dips a toe in commerce and doesn't like it, he/she can take an equally
tenured post in Champaign or Pasadena and not an eyebrow is raised.

<p>

Mind you, even just across the border in Austria, or up in Denmark, the
shortage of really powerful types leads to multiple positions.  A Heinz
Zemanek can run IBM's Vienna software lab, hold a fancy professorship, and
carry a government title all at once.  Not in Germany - and not in Japan,
either, as I had discovered on my 1960 visit.  The American system is much
much preferable, but most academic cultures change slowly; European ones, very
slowly.  Greed speeds the process; pride slows it!

<p>

Well, back to Berlin: after a great night in Joel Grey/Liza Minelli country I
flew back to Hamburg Tuesday morning and without disturbing Ranch took a taxi
to the Applied Mathematics Institute at Hamburg University, where the famous
Professor Collatz bought me a fine lunch and told me how he was building
special housing for the Telefunken TR4 the DFG had promised him, with air
conditioning "for the auxiliary equipment".  Not for people!

<p>

I had bought Collatz' powerful text on differential equations for the Watson
Lab library fifteen years before, and enjoyed the author, now white-haired.  A
babe in the woods compared to Wenke of BASF, in whose computer building the
Hamburg shop would hardly fill the printer paper storage area (also air
conditioned, and much more expertly!), just as Telefunken was a babe in the
woods compared to much smaller IBM - at least, U.S. IBM!

<p>

Which reminds me to note that Collatz was running on a big juicy 650 with core
memory, which must have hurt the DFG to rent or perhaps buy; made in
Poughkeepsie, not Sindelfingen (and with FORTRAN, not ALGOL: I congratulated
him.  He frowned at me, but he was a mathematician, not a programming
theorist).

<p>

I told CDC "his" TR4 was to have 24K words of core [I guessed Philips, but
never found out], and German tapes.  The latter info startled the tape drive
boys no end, as I'll describe in a later chapter.  And I told Collatz he would
need many many more staff to keep a TR4/KDF9/7090 busy, but he obviously
wasn't worried about doing so.

<p>

Just as I had whisked away to Oslo in the middle of my Swedish visits, so I
now broke off German visits to check out the Netherlands, Belgium and France.
I rescued the Simca from its Hamburg maintenance and drove in clearing weather
to Amsterdam, shuffling my carbon flimsies and stacks of brochures in the
process.  And I returned, from Paris and Rotterdam, Sunday night [25
February].

<p>

Picture us now in Dusseldorf.  After checking in at the hotel recommended by
the concierge at the Vier Jahreszeiten - I was now off the Savoy map - I
called my lawyer friend from Sankt Christoph and had a great reunion, a
terrific dinner, and a tour of the more sophisticated dancings, where Lorri
was known and could fend off the gorgeous but expensively dehydrated B-girls.
He asked me how I liked the Breidenbacher Hof, and was delighted to find I had
been given a room with Chinese decor.  They have a dozen such theme rooms, he
said, and the VJ must have tipped them off it was your first visit to
Dusseldorf.

<p>

Parenthetically, the city is now the center of Japanese interests in Germany,
and naturally has wonderful but fantastically expensive Japanese restaurants,
and a Nikko hotel.

<p>

I had no appointments in Dusseldorf, and had come mostly to be shown the town,
as Lorri had promised at New Year's.  In Hamburg I had asked also about hotels
in Essen, which was my next computer stop, but the superb porter had obvious
reservations.  I luxuriated in breakfast, called the law office to compliment
Lorri on his taste in dancings (and women, but I thought it safer not to say
so).  I reclaimed Ranch via an underwhelmed doorman and set off the few
kilometers to Krupp.

<p>

The towns of the Ruhr all run together, and the autobahn exits as well.  I was
taking my usual precaution of buying a town map in the previous town, which is
easier in Europe than in, say, New Jersey.  So I had no difficulty in choosing
a route into the heart of the enormous Krupp steelworks.  I was surprised to
find that my host had laid on an attractive interpreter, since he had some
English, but I soon came to realize he was a perfectionist; his computer
center reflected it.  My report that night told the story; I give it in full:

<p>
<blockquote>

Another terrific group.  [Herr Muster is effectively the] boss of about 180
people, including key punchers and 12 407s and operators - acres of old and
new P-C equipment, much of which is on the way out.  Has a very sophisticated
view of the place of the BIG machine at the center of the big firm.

<p>

Has specially built (fireproof) cases for 1100 (!!) reels of 729II tape,
visitors' gallery, explanatory diagrams etc. etc. etc.  Could be a very good
U.S. DP installation.  But he does OR, much scientific work, and hopes to make
an approach soon to short (3-4 km) data transmission - hindered he says by the
fact that the telephones are PTT-operated, so rules are old-fashioned and
performance inferior.  Would not use an IBM 7090 or 7080 "even if it were
across the street" - wants control of the machine, and complete privacy (Krupp
is of course esp. sensitive).  [Why?  Don't remember.]  Thinks there will be
little big-machine service bureau use [in West Germany] except for overflow
and backup.

<p>

Has 7070 and two 1401s; I (estimate) over 20 729IIs; for P-C see above.  His
own people do maintenance, including cleaning tapes every two hours of use.
Wow!

<p>

He needs to know about CDC.  Would be a very skeptical listener, but worth
influencing.  His bosses would not run to a 7090 - costs too much.  He wants
to know about production control and numerical control.  Aim for this guy if
you come to Germany!

</blockquote>
<p>

I said he would be ripe for a 3600 in "2-3 years", and made a mental note to
keep track of the man; as impressive as Klaus Wenke, although much more DPish.
When I asked about him in Univac Deutschland three years later, though, Otto
Stitz said he had "left for another company" - unusual in Germany.  I wish we
had better shared a language.

<p>

This was the conversation that triggered an item in a hundred speeches and
written paragraphs over my next 25 years.  I had suggested to Muster that
instead of relying on the PTT he put up a microwave link as North American had
between plants, at least across his Essen area and perhaps further within the
Ruhr.  He said it was "strengsten verboten" and that the PTT might shut down
services to all of Krupp if he played games!!  Ah, how not to catch up!

<p>

I drove during the lunch hour [sob!] to Dortmund, where my Dutch friends had
recently installed an Electrologica X I ["eecks een"] with 8K words of core.
This was at MBP GmbH (Mathematischer Beratungs- und Programmierungsdienst
[ouch!]).  "This is a private service activity that started five years ago
(like CEIR!)," I wrote.  "Teaches customers, offers complete closed-shop
services, especially in bridge design, pipe stresses, LP, and matrix work."

<p>

The entrepreneur was a Dr. H.K. Schuff, whom I would never have heard of
except through Loopstra; it was entirely a German, perhaps even entirely a
Ruhr, operation.  He had a math/physics background, and started with a CPC in
the late Fifties.  He claimed he was running 22 hours a day seven days a week
on his X I, which made me suggest him as a 1604A customer "in 1-2 years".

<p>

He showed me a high speed paper tape punch which I reported to Minneapolis as
a "(Creed??) 3000, doing 300 char/sec", and said he didn't need mag tape.  My
notes say "He should talk to Krupp!", about tape, that is, and "very
closed-shoppy indeed!"

<p>

That visit took only two hours, and I still had time to drive the long road to
Wiesbaden and check in at the Schwarzer Bock, highly recommended by the
Briedenbachers, in time to try their grillroom.

<p>

Wenke's Fraulein Hoffman had set me up at the Statistisches Bundesamt, which
in 1962 was like our Census.  This was continued into the Seventies, when I
had contacts with their people through the OECD, but has since changed.  My
host was a Herr Zindler, in charge of the 7070 project.  He had two 1401s at
work, and his new machine was literally in crates waiting for air conditioning
checkout (my notes said "here too!!").

<p>

It turned out that raw data was collected out in the ten l?nder [like
states: Bavaria, for instance], munched up in their ten individual 1401s by
almost identical software, and sent to Zindler on low-density mag tape.  I
told CDC he could benefit from a 1604, but it would have to tie to those
remote 1401s.

<p>

I also wrote he thought a company "could make a real impression if it used
outstanding and technical people - [Zindler] dislikes white-shirt punched card
salesmen ... says Rem Rand is 'hopeless' and no other foreign outfit has been
around, even Ferranti."  I pointed out he excluded Siemens and Telefunken
because they had no 1401-size machines planned, while CDC was about to start
pushing the 160A.  And I said not to send anybody calling "unless he knows
statistics!"  Of course they paid no attention.

<p>

I went back to the hotel for lunch, then drove off to Mainz for a valuable but
unhappy academic visit.  This was with F.L. Bauer and his sidekicks Baumann
and Samelson, at the Institute for Applied Mathematics of the University of
Mainz.  "Here flourishes the dread monster ALGOL," I wrote, "and Fritz is one
of its proudest papas.  He met me as an old but friendly enemy, and we talked
almost entirely about educational matters and avoided programming techniques!"

<p>

He had a Zuse Z22 "(tubes - there is a transistorized model Z23)" and a brand
new 2002, with three 727 tapes not yet connected.  And an actual running
ALGOL.  "His machines are powerful but do no commercial work ... A great waste
of expensive facilities - and a little practical [experience in the] use of
their compilers would help, too!"

<p>

I drove next morning to Heidelberg, to make my only astronomical visit of the
tour.  I had arranged it myself, weeks back, and thought it a miracle that all
the intervening travel, and the stormy weather, had let me keep the date.  I
went to the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut, which shared a tapeless Siemens
2002 with the ancient university.  The director was a Prof. Dr. Fricke, whom I
did not know, and the computer boss was named Lederle.  My trip report said in
part:

<p>
<blockquote>

This is the most advanced (computationally) of the three great national
ephemeris offices.  Greenwich is poorest, Washington has a 650.  These people
are very knowledgeable indeed in the general field ... and talk ATLAS, ALGOL
and IBM gossip with the best.  Their machine is paid for largely by the German
Forschungs-Gemeinschaft (like our NSF or British Univ Grants Comm) and they
share it with Heidelberg University which does the housekeeping and the
teaching.

<p>

Long and frank discussion about differences between university and industry
people in Germany (these men are among the very few "neutrals") - one major
factor in assessing your entry.

</blockquote>
<p>

Wenke had offered to meet me in the Ruhr or in Wiesbaden, but since I had
Ranch we agreed (via Fr&auml;ulein Hoffman) it would be easy for me to call
on him at home base and then drive on to Stuttgart.  It was an enormous
thrill to visit him in the very center of the world's largest chemical plant
- rebuilt from scratch starting in 1945 - and see his new building going up,
modelled in many respects after Building 305 in Evendale, but fifty percent
larger.  His 7090 was coming in less than a year, and he would obviously be
ready.

<p>

Klaus and I were good friends, and I had twice asked him to work for me
(failing only because his wife had no English, he said).  He would in later
years ask his bosses to be rewarded for his computer and LP triumphs by a
major step up the Badische ladder, and would be bluntly refused because he had
a super math/physics degree but none in chemistry.  He remembered how well I,
an astronomer [!], had been treated in Evendale; he was bitter, and in the end
left the company.  It was a genuine tragedy for him, for BASF, and for German
computing.

<p>

But that was all in the future.  I described him ("Call #1 in Germany", for a
6600) as:

<p>
<blockquote>

A world leader in applying input-output (Leontiev) theory to process industry.
Now has one of his senior men in Paris at IBM 7090 every night (rotating) to
actually make runs - reallocation of costs on 4000 chemicals including solving
1500 equations in 1500 unknowns, with few [sic, but meant "many"] zeroes (!!!
but there are relations), takes 10h on 7090 and he does this frequently.  Now
has Co. permission to tackle special LP job with 15,000 inequalities.  Cooo!"

</blockquote>
<p>

BASF had 50,000 employees in this one plant, with rail stations inside for
commuting.  This was the center of the old AGFA chemical empire, and was
bombed flat in WWII.  Early in the reconstruction they had rebuilt the guest
house, and had restored the AGFA wine collection they had hidden from the
thirsty American occupiers.  Klaus took me there for an early dinner;
unfortunately he was not a connoisseur or a big executive, but even so the
wines were great.

<p>

I got to Stuttgart very late, but the meticulous Fraulein Hoffman, whom I had
finally met and profusely thanked earlier in the day, had warned them to hold
my room at the Graf Zeppelin (the hotel had pleased me in 1961, but the name
was what drew me back).  Next morning I went again to the SEL [Standard
Electrik Lorenz] Informatikwerke in the Zuffenhausen district, and this time
met with a chap named Nathansohn, who was director of marketing for computer
and related equipment.  He said the people I had met before were "all away",
which I doubted very very much.

<p>

Actually I got far deeper into SEL business than with Marc De Ferranti's 1961
imprimatur, mostly because Nathansohn and his men read DATAMATION.  I was
shown "(first American, they said) the new Air France system which is stored
program (like SABRE but much cheaper) ... transistorized but not megacycled."
This was a follow-on to the hard-wired SAS and BEA systems.

<p>

They were still building their own drums, and were wiring their own core
planes with Philips cores.  What I emphasized to Control Data was that
Nathansohn said their general purpose ER56 computer would have been
competitive with the 2002, except the sponsor (DFG again) "insisted on change
after change.  Siemens had corresponding contract, refused to change anything,
now sells 2002s 'like pancakes'.  A nice phrase!"

<p>

His people also said the TR4 "had used Telefunken transistors that were no
good and was set back tremendously - redesign, extra costs, etc.", which
probably accounted for Garwick's software delay in Norway.

<p>

They were nice; I hoped to visit them again.  As for CDC, I said nothing
"unless you could buy `em from Geneen!".  I was sure the other stuff they were
making like the KA21 airline weight and balance computers, the Quelle
department store order-fulfilment machines, and even an experimental OCR
reader, was too far from Norris' game plan.

<p>

SEL gave me lunch in an executive dining room, not memorably, and sent me off
with an introduction to the Daimler-Benz offices in the Wangen district - not
the factory where my wonderful 190SL had been made, alas!

<p>

Turned out to be pure DP: the central accounting group (corporate stuff, not
plant payrolls and such).  I wrote "now on punched cards, next on 1401 with
some analysis, 'in three years' on 7070 with some optimization ... there is a
1620 in the turbomachinery engineering group. ... Very stodgy and ignorant
bunch of bookkeepers.  Ugh!  Know nothing but [German] IBM, and will certainly
not use 1401 to advantage. ..."

<p>

I left the Simca at Echterdingen, the funny Stuttgart airport, and flew off to
Vienna for a couple of days, as described later.  And from Vienna I flew to
Munich, for a little business and a lot of Fasching [carnival]!

<p>

I checked in at the Bayerischer Hof Saturday morning.  It turned out to be the
high-society center for carnival balls and such, and this was the weekend.
But the Vier Jahreszeiten magic had worked (early arrival was also good
insurance!) and my rather unfancy room was ready.  First thing I did was to
call my host Hans Radmer, who marvelled that I had gotten in at the BH ("sold
out months in advance" he said, but I guessed those were the fancy rooms and
suites.  I was in chauffeurs' quarters).

<p>

Hans had been great fun on the Arlberg, and was like me unwived not only at
the Hospiz but at home in Munich.  Turned out he was some sort of editor at
Blick or Twitch or whatever the local equivalent of Paris Match was, and of
course was invited to all the balls and parties except the very top "Von und
Zu" society ones.

<p>

"Too late to rent you a costume", he said, producing a large tartan
tam-o'shanter.  "Wear this with your blazer and look festive; if someone tries
to turn you away say you are a Scot and live in Monaco and Manhattan!"  So
began two wild days and nights of Marvelous Fasching.

<p>

I particularly remember a Dschungel Ball in the Haus Der Kunst, with two
thousand young dancers pounding so wildly you feared for the floor and walls.
And weisswurst for breakfast Sunday morning, although actually I had burned
off most of the beer and booze in excitement; Radmer, though, needed them!

<p>

I apologized for cramping his amatory style, because it was obvious he was a
great favorite with women of all ages and propensities.  I myself had gathered
much lipstick and cupped many a lovely bosom, but had made no major conquest.
"Fasching is like that," he laughed, implying although he had failed to score
Saturday night he had succeeded on many others.

<p>

Other German friends tell me Rio is better, but for me, that 1962 Fasching was
the greatest carnival of my life.

<p>

It hadn't occurred to me when I made the appointment that even research
stopped for carnival, but when I got to to Biermann's address on the
Ringstrasse Monday morning it was almost deserted.  All the juniors, right
down to the receptionists and secretaries, were out Jungle-balling and such -
or recovering from same, or getting ready for one last dose on Fat Tuesday.
And the halls were still decorated from their own internal parties!

<p>

But serious Biermann, who was the director for astrophysics of the
Max-Planck-Institut der Physik und Astrophysik, and his electronics head
Dr. Billing, were waiting faithfully.  I tried kidding about Fasching but got
nowhere; somehow I could not see either one in a tam-o'shanter!

<p>

Biermann had visited me twice in the States.  It gives some idea of his
stature to realize that in 1962 his opposite number as physics director was
Werner Heisenberg.  He had 150 senior staff and the physics side had 450; they
shared support staff and a fine three-year-old building.

<p>

The key fact was that Biermann was keen on computing, and Heisenberg himself
was not.  So after Billing built the G-1 and G-2 at G?ttingen, he moved the
G-3 to the astrophysics side of the house in Munich.  The shop also shared a
704 with the university, which gave them a good IBM contact in Applied Science
bypassing IBM Deutschland and the DP blue-suiters.

<p>

I knew from earlier conversations that Billing's group was going to go into
component research rather than build another complete machine, and approved.
As usual, their dough came from the DFG, and in spectacular quantities; they
did absolutely no industry-sponsored research, which did not mean their
thin-film projects would not get to Siemens and Telefunken in the end, but did
mean the transfer would be slow compared to the U.S.

<p>
<blockquote>

"Wanted to order a TR4," I wrote, "(cash, 6,000,000 DM) or an IBM.  Latter
said '60% discount' as usual, so 7094 = 5,800,000 DM and is in the lead.  I
also think TR4 is 2 years away, 7090 six months (change to 7094 a year or two
later).  These people operate a completely open highly research-minded shop,
very wasteful no doubt, and would suffer from a lack of ALGOL for TR4 - but
Telefunken has contracted with another Munich group to write the latter, with
Garwick of Oslo as a backstop.  Lots more real hot poop about TR4 transistor
trouble, Siemens programming ignorance etc. etc. ... ATLAS (20,000,000 DM)
... no discount!"

</blockquote>
<p>

My final sales comment was REAL LIKELY 6600 CUSTOMER IF YOU GIVE DISCOUNTS!!
Don't know if CDC ever called them.

<p>

Billing took me to lunch at an academic-type cafe, and Biermann and his quiet
wife, repaying Arizona entertainment, took me to a lovely restaurant called
Zur Kanne, expensive even by my standards.  I could hear the tumult of
Fasching mounting outside.

<p>

Before dinner I had fitted in a short visit to the rechenzentrum of the
Technischen Hochschule, more to make a courtesy call on the wonderful old man
of German computing, Professor Piloty, than to look for CDC opportunities.  I
already knew from conversations with him at UNESCO three years before that the
TH and the university would share access to anything Biermann and Heisenberg
were given.  And I knew Piloty and his son were key figures in arranging for
the first IFIP "do" in late August.

<p>

We talked also to Urich, whose young man S?gm?ller turned out to be
writing the Telefunken ALGOL, but I could not discover why, if the Unis and
THs and M-P-Is "do no commercial work".  "Curious.  Sheer love of ALGOL?" I
wrote in my visit report.

<p>

They showed me famous old PERM, still running after at least eight years, and
even in 1962 with paper tape input only.  It was a much-modified copy of the
Scandinavian BESK, and its poor keyboard had nurtured half the bright young
computer men of the country.

<p>

My major item said:

<p>
<blockquote>

All these people (MPI also) very skeptical about expansion of large machines
here [Europe] for technical work, but agree Germany is the most likely place.
They feel there are no trained middle-level people, and none in sight.  So
only places where there are large open-shop possibilities can cope.  I
strongly and loudly disagreed and advocated closed shop and internal training
... revealing argument.  Very obvious these academics don't even dream of our
industrial use of 7090s - but there are reasons (no military, no oil, little
aircraft or nuclear).

</blockquote>
<p>

And I went back to the BH to get ready for dinner.  That was the last of my
German visits.  Tuesday morning, stepping carefully through the carnival
debris at the airport, I flew back to Stuttgart and reclaimed my neglected
Simca, and drove soberly off to Bern.

<p>

In reading again the many pages of my final report to CDC, I find many
second-hand items I had picked up.  The first 705 III at Hoechst, praise for
Zuse and his machines, many comments about the educational system - all
worthwhile.  But what I have written above gives the flavor fairly well.  I
repeat instead my advice about location:

<p>
<blockquote>

... for several reasons I choose Munich.  The probable boom in government and
industrial research is one; the comparative lack of competition is another;
the availability of personnel and services, low costs, and familiarity with
Americans are considerable advantages.  Then, Munich is like the American
West: people from Hamburg will move to Munich, but M?ncheners won't move
north. ... Finally, Munich is an intellectual center for our field; the IFIP
`62 fling is proof, and if you announced or displayed your European entry in
connection therewith, it would have doubled effect.

</blockquote>
<p>

My second choice was Dusseldorf, my third Hamburg ("too much like Chicago").
When Control Data finally came, they went to Luzern, and when they were run
out of there they went straight to Frankfurt.  I think their Minnesota bank
sent them!

<p>

The little Simca ranch wagon took to the autobahn as if designed for it.  The
two of us found our way out of Hamburg and across the lowering Elbe on the
proper bridge, and buzzed away southwestward.  It was a long haul, and I
thought wistfully of the trains we had ridden together only weeks before.  But
it was in fact only 285 km to Utrecht, and doubling around to Amsterdam took
only an hour more.

<p>

This was one of the hotel reservations I had made from London.  In 1954
Dorothy and I had stayed at the Amstel, and had found it stuffy.  With a car I
could range more widely, and so I chose the Apollo, which is at the
intersection of five canals and for a few years could be reached from the
airport by boat [alas! no more].  I liked it, and stayed there several more
times over the next decade, and also sampled five or six other places later.
Today I would go to the Okura, for the sushi and sashimi; in 1962 I ate an
enormous rijstaafel at the Bali.

<p>

Wednesday morning I called Edsger Dykstra at the Mathematisch Centrum.  Aad
Wijngaarden had warned me he himself would be away [in the U.S. as I
remember], but of course I had met Dykstra in 1954 and several times since, so
there was no problem.  Later in the morning we were joined by Bram Loopstra,
who had been with Aad when they visited me in Arizona, and who was now
actually manufacturing and delivering X 1s.  The first one was still at work
at the center, fed by their own marvelous paper tape.  I quote my report:

<p>
<blockquote>

 ... The money is a local bank, the R/D by Delft [university] (and sub rosa by
the PTT!).  The non-machine math program is funded by the national research
organization of the Dutch government.

<p>

This is an ALGOL center - and theirs RUNS!  One of the 2-3 in all Europe that
really does.  And they have their own paper tape reader (runs at 1600
char/sec, can be 5-8 holes, stops "on the hole" at 1400!)

<p>

Their work is largely internal - computer design, on computer; advanced
students; ALGOL and such.  They worry most about the shortage of (bright,
young) people.

</blockquote>
<p>

Actually they had performed their miracles with bright, not-so-young people:
Aad himself, Loopstra, van der Poel.  The youngsters had been drained off into
the universities and by Dykstra purisms.  But it was great to see another
Bech-type outfit.

<p>

Rudi Lunbeck called during the morning, knowing my itinerary, and told me I
was expected for lunch "on top of our building".  I had not been too clear on
a route, since his place was across the harbor - sort of behind the rail
station, if you know Amsterdam.  No, he said, there is a private parking, and
the Shell launch runs every few minutes; he would meet it!

<p>

This was the laboratory, or at least the Amsterdam laboratory, of Royal Dutch
Shell.  I no longer know its height, but it must have been ten stories at
least, and there was indeed a fine executive dining room on top, looking out
over the water.  Rudi, who acted like an old friend although we had only met
two or three times, had brought a Mr. Ponstein and a vigorous type from the
Hague DP group named Krajenbrink; we had a wonderful meal, much different from
the usual sandwiches they would have had without my welcome advent.

<p>

Because it led later in the year to a C-E-I-R/STRETCH idea and contact with
top brass, I give my visit report, noting first that Rudi, who was director of
the computer group, had an old Ferranti Mark I*, PACE analog equipment, access
to Krajenbrink's 7070 in the Hague, and 1401s galore:

<p>
<blockquote>

This is one of the great technical computing groups in Europe.  Their
interests are broad, their accomplishments early, their support good.  I was
the more interested, then, to have them say they no longer wanted a larger
machine of their own, but would prefer to buy block time on an ATLAS or some
such.  They feel ATLAS, like ORION, may be in trouble for lack of top Ferranti
support now (it had it some years ago).  Their choice for a successor machine,
if they had to make a choice, would be Telefunken TR4 with English Electric
KFG9 [KDF9, of course] a close second.  They go frequently to Houston and know
many of our "secrets", like the inadequacy of the CEIR-Caltex LP90 linear
programming scheme.  They have one an order of magnitude (decimal!) faster.

</blockquote>
<p>

I burned to tell them about the 6600, and called them an absolute certainty
for one "ON SERVICE BUREAU BASIS".  I hinted broadly I had something to offer,
and all three of them guessed a Burroughs B5000.  Poor Norris!  (Although
thinking about it later I realized he was pushing Surly Seymour's creation a
lot harder than the Detroiters were pushing their strange beast.  Years later
I was to recall those Burroughs problems when Texas Instruments was trying to
pretend they had never heard of their own excellent ASC supercomputer.)

<p>

Krajenbrink said I probably had "seen a 7070", and we agreed I would visit him
in the Hague next time.  They poured out stories about van der Poel, whom I
was to see later, and all came down to the boat dock to wave me off in true
Dutch fashion.  Wonderful!

<p>

I had already made weird plans for transportation, and these included spending
the night in Rotterdam.  So I was a little taken aback when my next visit
turned into a long evening.  I drove from the Shell parking to the
Leidschendam area of the Hague, signed in at the Netherlands Postal and
Telecommunications Laboratory, and had a brisk look at van der Poel's ZEBRA
installation.  He then climbed into Ranch and directed me to his apartment,
introduced me to his wife, said tea would be along in a while, and settled in
for philosophy!

<p>

Dr. Ir. [Engineer] W.L. van der Poel was one of the senior architects of
European computing.  He had come out of university at exactly the right time,
had done paper designs, had worked with van Wijngaarden on relay and tube
machines, had been drafted by the PTT (which permitted him to help on the X
1), and in some strange way had designed the Stantec ZEBRA, which I mentioned
in connection with my abortive ITT ventures.

<p>

" ... a most unusual bit-accessible, almost microprogrammed small/medium
computer (about 160A size!)" I wrote.  "Stantec did the circuit design from
his logical design.  It is clear he is disgusted with [British] Stantec and
wishes he had gotten a Dutch or Scandinavian outfit to build it."

<p>

He poured this out across the carpeted coffee table, losing me a hundred times
in technical details.  He had the brilliance but not the business acumen of
Niels Bech, whom he brushed aside with dismissive remarks about GIER; I was
rivetted.  "He should visit Minneapolis," I said in my visit report, imagining
the first confrontation with Seymour Cray!

<p>

I lived in the Hague for three years at the beginning of the Eighties.
Rereading my assessment of the country, its terrific people, and its 1962
computer possibilities in my final letter-report in the light of what I
learned later, I think it accurate:

<p>
<blockquote>

The Country: The most solidly based of the Benelux trio, Holland has a
fully developed middle class, a very high level of technical industry,
considerable under-unemployment [ah, 1962] - everything required for
successful use of large computers except sheer size.  And several of its
enterprises, notably Shell and Philips, have that also.

<p>

It is not often realized how much heavy industry centers around the shipping
facilities: petroleum of course, with four or five huge refineries (Shell at
Rotterdam is the largest in Europe), petrochemicals, regular chemicals, rubber
and plastics, coal and steel shipment [the Ruhr and much more].  My friends at
Shell talk in terms that would be considered advanced even in Texas - in fact,
their Houston people look to Amsterdam for much technical direction.

<p>

Dutch executives are less individualistic than their German counterparts, and
far less so than the Italians.  Committees are more in vogue; plans are worked
out in exquisite detail and are reviewed frequently.  And, like professional
managers in America, they attend seminars and play business games on
computers, and so on.  It is not by accident that IBM put its European
customer administrative "school" at Blaricum, near Amsterdam.

<p>

Labor costs are very low, and professional salaries only a little less so,
compared to Belgium and Scandinavia and Switzerland - the countries one
normally thinks of as comparable.  In fact, only Austria and Italy pay less
[1962] for middle-rank technical people.  They still ride bicycles in the
Netherlands!  In fact, I have to admit I don't understand how wages can be so
low when workers are being imported from the Mezzogiorno and from Spain.  Not
to program X 1s, you understand!

<p>

Perhaps we should realize that not everybody in the world really wants two
cars.  I wonder if there is not in Holland a real interest in efficiency and
excellence for its own sake, not just as a path to material possessions.

</blockquote>
<p>

I went on about higher education and such, and then buckled down to computers.
It bears mentioning that after thrashing around for a few years, Control Data
put a major center in Rijswijk, just outside the Hague, and it did very well.
I have to say, however, that my advice had long before sunk into the sands!

<p>

And one of the fractious tribes Caesar wrote about was the Belgae.  True, his
Belgae were Celts, not Flemings and Walloons, but they hung about and
disturbed his cross-channel planning, as they do in the Nineties.

<p>

I really did a visit in 1962 because I had a friend in Belgium whom I had not
seen during my ITT travails the year before.  This was Carl Grosjean, who had
been the first foreign Watson Lab Fellow at Columbia, in 1948.

<p>

While I was laying out my route in detail at the Savoy, I thought about the
problem of having even a nimble little French car in Paris; why not leave
Ranch in Brussels, go see Grosjean, and fly or take a train down to my Paris
interviews?

<p>

As I picked up stories about France in England and Denmark I began to whittle
my call list.  I had used up Phil Dreyfus, who seemed to be in Geneva most of
the time nowadays; I didn't dare call on IBM in the Place Vend?me, and
especially not on Maisonrouge; I intended to visit Grenoble and Nice and
Marseille from Monte-Carlo.  In the end I came down to Electricit? de
France for its Gamma 60, and some calls - if I could get the Paris phones to
work, even from my hotel - to the Sorbonne.

<p>

On the other hand, I added adventure on the travel side.  I got the Savoy to
reserve me in Rotterdam the night of the 22nd (they chose the Parkhotel), and
to buy me a helicopter [!!] ticket RTM/BRH/PAR, the latter being a downtown
pad near the Eiffel Tower which has long since disappeared.  That eliminated
parking problems, since Rotterdam had plenty at its small airport; it avoided
the long taxi ride in from Orly, and gave me my first European heli rides (the
real reason, of course).

<p>

After I detached myself from the van der Poels I drove the few minutes to
Rotterdam and checked in.  The new center town engrossed me, although
everything except eating places was closed before I arrived.  I ate Chinese,
and very good it was.

<p>

Next morning I left my Simca at the airport and climbed into a noisy Sabena
Sikorsky.  I was ticketed for BRH, the downtown helipad, and it worked.  I
took a taxi to the main station and caught the next train to Ghent.

<p>

Parenthetically, the wind cancelled my heli into Paris next morning.  The
Sabena Sikorsky dropped us at BRU, the international airport, and they laid on
a decrepit DC6 into LeBourget (still, better than Orly!).  I was early into
the Lotti.

<p>

Back to computing.  Grosjean had prospered, and was now director of the
rekenlaboratorium of the university.  He had planned for me to visit
CENTRATOM, which had a MERCURY, but it turned out to be 50 km out of Brussels
- too far.  He had had a CPC, now ran a 610, and was waiting for a paper-tape
1620; was deeply involved with IBM and the grateful recipient of one of the
famous sixty percent discounts.  He also quietly used a CAB500 "elsewhere in
Belgium", which meant not-IBM and not-Flemish.

<p>

I reported:

<p>
<blockquote>

... much of his conversation revolved about how much better they [IBM] are
than Ferranti, Rem Rand, etc. etc.  He does crystallography, numerical
analysis teaching [he had audited my Columbia course], and especially partial
diff. equations of neutron and electron diffusion ...  agrees that "the old
school" professors are a road block in his kind of university; less, in
technical "high schools".  Expects major use of medium-to-small machines now
that the Brussels Congo-slump is about over; sees only limited use of large
machines except in manufacturers' service bureaus.

</blockquote>
<p>

I suggested the faint possibility of a 1604A if he could share with the atom
boys (since the MERCURY would be slipping as Ferranti lost interest).

<p>

Carl was happy to see me, and even offered to drive me the long way south to
Brussels.  I got him to load me on a train and wrote up my report in the
restaurant car (no meal, but I did manage wine instead of candy-butcher beer).
I was indeed expected at the Amigo, where I had stayed when visiting Marc
DeFerranti a year before.  I delved deep into Jim Miles' pocket and ate
another fantastic meal at La Maison du Cygne on the Gran' Place.

<p>

I left the Amigo in Brussels reluctantly, feeling I should somehow integrate
the "headquarters city", as I called it in my report, a little further into my
thinking.  The fast trains of Japan and France not having been put in service,
it took me five hours to the Gare du Nord in Paris, an hour center-to-center
longer than flying.  But I had a fine lunch and interesting scenery, and got
to the Lotti in time for my mid-afternoon appointment.  This was at the
research laboratory of Electricit? de France, the enormous French power
utility, in the 6th arrondissement just south of the ?toile.

<p>

Somehow I had missed meeting my host at UNESCO in 1959.  He was the operator
of "the other" Gamma 60 - Phil Dreyfus had promised to show me the railroad
installation, with its standby diesel-electric power and its banks of
fallible line printers.  His name was Carteron, and in later years he became a
major French figure in IFIP, culminating in the local chairmanship of the 1983
Paris meeting, which I remember for the complete failure of the electronic
messaging (the French PTT is much more adventurous than its German or Swiss
counterparts, but much less efficace).

<p>

Since I had not met him before, I did not realize he had very good English,
and he let me sweat through a long conversation, curling the lip at the
barbarian; I did not mention this in my report.  Also he overstated his
involvement with the huge EdF network.  Three years later Pier Abetti told me
CIGRE had never heard of him, and that the r?seau planning was done at the
IBM applied science facility!

<p>

He did do major OR work in one of his sections, however, "and a great deal of
nuclear reactor systems design" in his nuclear studies section, I reported.

<p>

Main story, however, was that he was so dissatisfied with the reliability of
his Gamma 60 (he said "programming difficulty", which didn't make sense) that
he had turned it over to another group to be used "only for bookkeeping".
Wow!

<p>

My machine notes say "Had CPC, then SEPSEA [a new company for me] CAB500
(major customer), then second Bull Gamma 60; now expects 7090 'this year' to
go in new building 15 km out from present central site.

<p>

"Unfortunately he would not talk much about Bull, except to say that like
Ferranti they suffer from 'family direction'.", I wrote.

<p>

I thought it was a good interview except for language problems at the time,
but now realize I was being jerked around by a grandes ?coles type who was
resentful of American leadership in the very unParisian computer game.

<p>

Because I never got to do those south-of-France calls in March my final report
to Norris was more about the country and the people of France, and less about
its computers.  Although very long, I give it almost in full - partly as a
sample, partly because of all my "country" reports it remains the most cogent.

<p>
<blockquote>

        <u>The Country</u>: To my mind, France is the most curious mixture of
opposites in Europe today - in all of Europe, West and East.  Torn to pieces
internally by a hundred centrifugal forces [ah there, 1968], she yet presents
a single bland face to the visitor.  Her workmen create the most beautiful
ocean liner, the most comfortable air transport, the greatest hydroelectric
development in Europe - yet strikes and dislocations abound, and it is
impossible to hire a carpenter who can frame a door.  IBM is building a
beautiful laboratory in the Var valley near Nice; an electron microscope is
easy, but the towel holders in the lavatories are upside down!

<p>

France is a Mecca for tourists and businessmen from all over the world, yet I
am not persuaded that visitors are welcome.  The most powerful service bureau
operation on the continent is housed in Paris - the IBM European Center - but
Frenchmen object to the name: it should be the French Center!  There are more
institutes, societies (in the American sense of the word), and corporations
(which the French often call societies) devoted to operations research and the
rationalization of management processes in France than in the US and the UK
put together.  And there can be few European countries where more small
enterprises operate in complete disregard of modern practices!

<p>

The political scene is important, even if Americans can hardly hope to master
its kaleidoscopic changes. ... Yet IBM makes a tremendous effort in France:
offices, factories, two laboratories, a big customer training program.  And
they have no problem at all.  Have they mastered the problem, do they ignore
it, or are they sweating it out?  I haven't the faintest idea [1998 opinion:
probably 'ignore'].  But in my book the political problem is enough to push
France, and especially Paris, two or three places down on the list of CDC
entries.

<p>

French executives don't really like other Frenchmen very much but believe me,
they prefer 'em to Americans!  It is quite permissible to hand out technical
manuals in English, but the chit-chat has to be in impeccable French.  Far
fewer senior managers speak English than in Germany, and those who do are not
particularly proud of the skill or anxious to exercise it.

<p>

The key to technical adventures in France is the corps of graduates of the
?cole Polytechnique.  Without too much humor they call themselves the
Mafia!  And the new head of Rem Rand in France, the old head of the Gamma 60
effort at Bull, the IBM applied science manager for France, and the chap
planning the La Gaude laboratory are all members.  They usually have on their
calling cards "Ancien El?ve de l'?cole Polytechnique" - it's that
valuable!  These chaps are somewhat mobile; not as much as they would be in
the US, of course, but they do occasionally make a switch.

<p>

Below this brilliant but small group there is a great void and, unlike the
British, the French are making no substantial move to change the situation.
The dead hand of the professor, the white-bearded holder of the chair of
classical languages, is nowhere heavier than in Paris.  Once you get out to
Grenoble, very strong in physics and applied math, to Toulouse, even to Nancy
and Stasbourg and the third-rank schools, the picture improves in its details.
Unfortunately, national [university] policy is dominant; this is of course set
in Paris, mostly at the Sorbonne.

<p>

        <u>Computers</u>: The French made an early start at putting in IBM
equipment, and 650s are everywhere.  They were made in the Paris suburbs [no:
in Angers], which more or less took the curse off their American design, and
IBM handed out academic discounts here earlier than elsewhere in Europe.
There is an astronomical 650 at Meudon, with a 7070 requested; there are at
least ten 650s in universities (including really remote sites ... like
Nantes); the competition hardly exists!

<p>

By the same circumstances, France is the only European area with many 705s.
Since I don't have good DP connections established in Paris yet, I have to
rely on American sources: as high as sixteen installed.  These aren't just in
fancy places, like Esso where Duflos is head of European GUIDE, but in
Normandy and the Saar and so on.  Renard, who was head of Applied Science last
year, said that Region Four (Galactic Headquarters lingo for France) would
have more 7090s than any other WTC region in the world by the end of 1962.
Only four are actually in, I think, counting Carteron's at Electricit? de
France, but many more must be on order.  There will be another one inside IBM
- they say - at the new laboratory at La Gaude near Nice.

<p>

As for those ubiquitous 1401s, even the venerable Banque de France has ordered
one.  Rem Rand in Lausanne estimates over 120 orders and deliveries in France
already.  I have no dope on 1620s, but would guess more than in any other
Common Market nation by a substantial margin.

<p>

Talking of Rem Rand, Bibby has renovated the management in Paris and there is
a good chance things will pick up for them.  They are almost negligible
compared to IBM at the moment.  Of the other American firms, Philco and
Honeywell made quick passes but without leaving much of a trail; National Cash
has a nice office but is pushing the Elliott line, and has an actual 803 on
the Champs-Elys?es; RCA is represented but the big deal with Bull for 301s
must interact with 501 sales; others may be around but have escaped my
attention.

<p>

Of the English firms, Elliott is the only current effort.  There are two or
three Ferranti outposts, the best known being a PEGASUS in Amouyal's shop at
the Atomic Energy Commission in Paris.  Since the latter also operate a 650, a
704 (with 7090 in by now, I guess), a small Bull drum, much analog gear, and
had a Gamma 60 on order at one time, the Ferranti machine was not exactly
featured.  In fact, I was told about it by the Oxford people!  English
Electric is talking KDF9, again according to Oxford, but I forgot to ask about
DEUCEs.

<p>

Olivetti had thought of France as their third country, after Italy and
Switzerland.  They had made no actual gesture, however, because of the
Bull-Olivetti agreement.  I don't know of any interest from Siemens or
Telefunken; Loopstra has an Electrologica X 1 in his "factory" for a French
location and gave me the impression another one was already in, but did not
say where.

<p>

The French native picture is relatively simple.  There is a "society", a
corporation, called SEPSEA, a subsidiary of SEA (Societ? d'Electronique et
d'Automatisme), which designs and markets a small machine called CAB500.  The
actual manufacturing is by Schneider-Westinghouse and SOM.  This is a drum
machine with its own paper tape reader (SEA 1080) and perforator.  The
elements are magnetic (SEA SYMMAG 200).  Pretty small stuff; some
microprogrammed flexibility but nothing like GIER; competitive with a poor
1620, I'd say.  I had not seen one before this trip, so I was rather
interested.

<p>

That leaves only Bull - and what can one say about Bull?  They have a complete
line: punched cards, peripheral equipment, small drum machine (the ET), the
new unbuffered 300 system with some sort of Gamma (probably an improved Gamma
3) arithmetic and logical unit, and of most interest to CDC, the ill-fated
Gamma 60.  Roberto Olivetti told me in the summer of 1960 that he had seen
"the pieces" and it had not run.  Phil Dreyfus said in November 1961 they had
"made" thirteen - I did not and do not believe it.  In between, two at least
actually ran: one at the French Railways ([enormous] payroll) and the other at
Carteron's place.  The latter operation was so unsatisfactory Carteron gave
the machine to some accountants and ordered a 7090, which may be in by now.
Dreyfus and his boss are both supposed to have left, Dreyfus for ECMA in
Geneva and the general manager for the US (both rumors unverified).  Anyhow, I
wouldn't exactly worry over the 60!

<p>

        <u>Trends</u>: As unfavorable as Britain, but without the upturn I see
ahead with a new British management generation.  Mind you, the level of
technology in France is already so high that continued and expanding use of
machines, especially your 1604 and 3600 sizes, is certain.  But the total will
not rise too much; old and small will be replaced by new and larger, so some
money will be spent - but there aren't any more "Mafia" to go around!  So
where do the intellectual leaders that could force our babies on a reluctant
top management come from?  More Carterons could do it, but you can count on
precious few of those per decade - a small fraction of the Polytechnique
graduating class, which already is too thinly spread.

<p>

I agree with Armand, the board chairman of the school, when he says the
students (everywhere in the EEC, not just [Polytechniciens] in Paris) are the
key to the New Europe.  He says, "The real difference in France is not between
the Right and the Left, but between the old and the young!"  OK, I applaud;
but in France there are many strong old men and few acceptably trained young
ones.

<p>

Incidentally, IBM completely disagrees with me on this, at least officially.
The Nice laboratory, however, is one of the few places in France where foreign
researchers are to be imported!

<p>

        <u>Competition</u>: IBM and Bull; pending reorganization at the
latter, and a resolution of what Carteron referred to as "family" problems, I
would not worry much.  You would not be wise to run them down, let alone laugh
at them; that would raise French hackles clear to Tananarive.  Sympathy -
that's the line!  But they could revive, of course.

<p>

That leaves IBM, and I can't think of anywhere else on earth, even Endicott,
New York, where their competition will be tougher.  They have nearly every
bright young man in France (in our field or nearby, you understand) already
aboard or panting after them.  This is another reason why I put France lower
on the list than you may have expected.  Of course you've licked `em before,
but this would be very tough terrain indeed.

<p>

        <u>Probable Customers</u>: Carteron for a 3600 or even a 6600; Amouyal
at the CEA ditto - and lots of others one notch down, for 1604s.  I'd avoid
much effort on the discount customers - the university and institute types.
IBM will wheel up a 60 percent deal, with time buy-back in addition, the
minute the evil number 1604 is even whispered.  Try, by all means - but don't
spend much money.

<p>

I would look hard at the outlying heavy industries, and in odd corners.  Sud
Aviation and SNECMA (jet engines) come to mind, and the chemical complex
around Marseilles.  The Mafia stick pretty close to the Place Vend?me!  And
by all means check the many American outfits; not all of them love IBM as much
as, alas, Socony and Esso.

<p>

        <u>Service Centers</u>: The IBM one in Paris has a big 7090
installation, a good 1620, and two 1401s.  They will probably take in some
work on the Nice 7090 in a year or so, but not sell it actively.  They also
have a 650 in Lyon.

<p>

Bull has a center in Paris, with several machines but no Gamma 60 - and not
too much work, except the usual customer checkout.  They helped with the big
Serre-Pon?on project two or three years ago.

<p>

The schools do not in general take in paid work, although the prohibition is
not as formal as in Germany.  If a professor consults for either a government
or an industrial organization, some of their work may get done on the computer
center of the university; I don't know who gets the money, if any.

<p>

Many of the management consulting firms like SEMA will act as intermediaries
in getting work done, and will sell programming and analysis in the process.
IBM itself offers programming services in Paris; rather unusual in their
operations.  All the people I know who use that 7090 do their own softwork,
however, so I haven't heard about quality.

<p>

C-E-I-R has an affiliate, Charles Salzman, but no business in our line as of
last November.  I have not checked more recently.  Diebold is in Paris also.
And Arthur Andersen, but not for DP work, I believe.  There will be many more.

<p>

        <u>Programming</u>: France is not too ALGOLized, being so strongly
IBM.  Bull never cared much for it either.  So it's FORTRAN and FORTRANSIT,
forever and (ugh!) ever.

<p>

The CAB500 has its own PAF (Programmation Automatique des Formules), an
itty-bitty FORTRAN with multilingual printout.  I have a manual; end of
comment!

<p>

There is going to be a real push for DP programmers in a year or two.  The
supply of trainable young people is small; girls are still being unearthed,
but even this source is drying up.  Salaries are pretty well in line with the
economy as a whole, except perhaps in Paris, where only headwaiters are paid
adequately.  [Programmers] have cars, not Alfa Romeos perhaps, but not 2CVs
either.  As for the more highly educated scientific types, they all work for
IBM already.  Even Carteron is worried.

<p>

        <u>CDC Entry</u>: Be very conservative indeed about this one.  I
certainly think you can sell here, and my figures ... said so; I think you can
do so rather quickly.  But the risk is high, the growth not as spectacular as
in several other countries - although admittedly from a big base - and the
costs of doing business among the highest in Europe.

<p>

I have one rather daring suggestion to make, one which ties in with my own
preferences and my own idea of very long-term trends in the Community:
consider another location in France.  Paris is worked over, and competed for,
so vigorously that costs are just astronomical.  Not only are there no
programmers; there are no stenographers, no secretaries, no telephones - and
the French themselves are fed up with it.  Just as many New Yorkers want to
emigrate, so do some very good young Frenchmen.  The California of France is
the Riviera, and IBM is as usual well up on the possibilities.  They even
persuaded Papo, one of the Mafia, to leave Paris (true, he looks to be a
Mediterranean type).

<p>

There is also the Saar, if you don't go into Dusseldorf.  And there is the
French region around Geneva - but I think there is too little industry, and
too little trend toward industry, there.  The companies going there are just
trying to get the benefits of Geneva while staying in France; good
communications, transportation, and housing.  But the costs are Parisian!
[1994: still true!].

<p>

This was of course part of my reason for going to Monaco myself; the climate
is magnificent (Los Angeles without smog), air and rail transportation quite
good, the university (Nice) improving rapidly.  Costs are higher in Monaco
than in Nice, but there are tremendous tax savings.  Switzerland and Northern
Italy are accessible.  California in the Twenties!

<p>

Marseilles is pretty unglamorous, but much cheaper - and it has a good
industrial base.  Perhaps Procter &amp; Gamble would like a 160A?  The climate
is still very good.  If Nice is the coming French Los Angeles, and Monte-Carlo
its Santa Barbara, then Marseilles is Long Beach and San Pedro!

<p>

When I got back to the Lotti, by the way, I found a fine telegram from
Ludwigshafen signed BASF.  Actually it was from the Fraulein Hoffman who has
already appeared in the Germany chapter, and it started, "Thanks telegram
Wenke on vacation until 26.  We arranged first visits 26 morning phone arrival
Krupp Mr. Muster ..." and went on with details of a Dortmund visit that later
fell through, and the visit at the Weisbaden Federal Statistical Office, and
concluded by saying Klaus would go with me to see Fritz Bauer in Mainz,
"further arrangements when together."

<p>

I was reminded how much my terrific secretaries had extended my reach in
Generous Elecric; here this unheralded American (whom Wenke had obviously
described to her in detail, as I had described him to Jean Miller) burst in on
her quiet office, and she did just what her boss would have wanted her to do.

<p>

A weekend in Paris!  Well, not the whole weekend - had to get back to my car
in time for the first date "BASF" had arranged Monday.  But I had time for two
very expensive Paris dinners and a lot of Saturday walking.

<p>

About the Friday one there is a story.  I had read in the Herald Trib during
the trip that the new Michelin Guide, which would appear as always at Easter,
was likely to promote Lasserre to three stars.  After I got through with my
telegram and other arrangements at the Lotti (rail travel back to Rotterdam,
for example, and a reservation at the Alcazar for Saturday night), I dressed a
little more sharply - a fancy English shirt and non-clashing dark tie, as I
remember - and went to try the about-to-be-starred restaurant.

<p>

I was suavely welcomed in French, and in spite of not having a reservation and
it being a Friday, was sent upstairs.  A handsome young man in business suit,
whom I assumed was family, said (in English) a table was being set for me, and
in no time at all a tiny affair for one was carried out from the pantry and
beautifully fitted out.  He led me over, introduced my captain, and went on to
his next guests.

<p>

I had a kir while I revelled in the big but not grotesque carte.  I thought it
better to order items I was sure of, since I had forgotten which specialties
the Trib had mentioned and had left my 1961 Michelin in Ranch.  I had a
scallop appetizer, sort of a supercharged coquille St. Jacques, and steak ?
la moelle, ? point.

<p>

To blossom out, though, I ordered [later] a wild chocolate thingie with
caramelized oranges.  Wowee!

<p>

Everything was magnificent.  As I was doing a yellow chartreuse the young man
appeared and asked if I had enjoyed the meal.  Taking him seriously, I went
through my choices including wine, praising everything, and said the steak was
wonderfully flavorful but "not as tender as in New York".

<p>

He replied that "they" would have chosen Scotch beef instead of Charolais for
me, but had thought at first I was Dutch!  Now that, that, THAT is the real
McCoy.  And yes, they got their third star in April.

<p>

Sunday morning I reluctantly checked out of the Lotti and caught the best
train to Rotterdam, and reclaimed the Simca.  It must have been in a garage
for repairs, because my expense record shows 135.20 guilders - but how could I
have paid on Sunday??  My mind is blank.  Anyhow, I drove to Dusseldorf and
went on the town with my lawyer friend, as already described: a memorable
weekend.

<p>

I had broken off my German visits, left my little wagon in Stuttgart, and
flown to Vienna the morning of Thursday 1 March.  The schilling was only four
cents, so 150 from Schwechat to the majestic Bristol (reserved for me by the
all-knowing Vier Jahreszeiten) did not faze me.  I could feel excitement in
the air, and soon found out that the Opera Ball, highlight of the entire
Vienna year, was Friday night, and that the Bristol was the center of all the
parties and dinners and suppers (ah, you knew, Four Seasons!).

<p>

As I unpacked I realized that the VJ introduction had gotten me a corner room
with a tiny balcony overlooking the Opera entrance!  I figured the thing to do
was to have a snack Friday evening (not in the Bristol, for sure), go up to my
room, and watch the loveliest people in that part of the world stream into the
Ball.  And I did!

<p>

Reluctantly, to business: the Mathematisches Laboratorium der Technischen
Hochschule.  I had met Inzinger, the "president", at UNESCO in 1959, and
therefore knew he had a 650 with, unusual for Europe, floating point.  He was
cordial, and we settled in for a long talk.  I quote my entire report:

<p>
<blockquote>


This group primarily teaches and is not (praise be!) spending much time on
programming theory [I was heartily sick of ALGOL, with Fritz Bauer yet to
come].  Open shop for engineering professors, student problems in applied math
and numerical analysis.  Has own publication, like Schuff in Dortmund:
(MATHEMATIK-TECHNIK-WIRTSCHAFT), worth having in your library.  Cooperative
program in solid rather elementary operations research, with state (i.e.
national) planning and economic agency (not done in Germany!) - uses
"transportation" program modified from 650-user library for allocation of
state aid to industry, highway improvement.  I'm not sure how much the results
are used, you understand - but I saw real output on its way to the appropriate
ministers.

</blockquote>
<p>

I reported he had three racks of Telefunken RA-463 analog equipment.  I said
regretfully the lab was too big for a 160A, too small for years for a 1604A.
And I arranged to see Inzinger at IFIP at the end of the summer.

<p>

Heinz Zemanek, who lived around behind the cathedral in Blutgasse, claimed me
for lunch and took me to one of his locals.  I was to know him very very much
better in future years; I thought of him at the moment as Mr. IFIP for
Austria, and since I was not happy with the governance of that new body - I
thought the bylaws guaranteed European-style do-nothing-ism, which certainly
turned out over these next 46 years to be dead right - I warmed to him only
slowly.  Also he preferred ALGOL to his employer's FORTRAN.

<p>

After lunch I took a tram, chosen by Heinz, out into the near suburbs to the
C. Reichert Optische Werke, and had a wonderful time.  I went because
Dr. Reuschel, the head of the computing department, had an old Zuse, a Z11.
And I was warmly welcomed because he and his people, who didn't read
DATAMATION and didn't know IBM from Siemens, had studied all my tiny parcel of
optical papers (1946-48) and had had the Zuse engineers hard-wire my ray
tracing formula into their relay [!!]  computer.

<p>

"Runs 13h/day.  About 1620 size but of course much older," I wrote.  "Reuschel
feels there is more interchange of information, techniques, and even personnel
between industry and academic worlds in Austria, not only because of size 'but
the professor is not so worship here!'."  He had had some contact with Rem
Rand (pushing the SS90) but "not scientific people - I could not talk on
them."

<p>

I left reluctantly.  One of the youngsters drove me back to the Bristol, and I
stood entranced in the snow and cold on my balcony watching the beautiful
women and ball gowns across the street from ten o'clock on.  I've never
forgotten it: a charmed introduction to a special city.

<p>

Two nights in my fancy room at the second best hotel in Vienna, plus two
breakfasts and one dinner, plus service, came to less than a thousand
schillings.  Those were indeed, indeed the days!

We are about to embark on my last two visits of the Secret 1962 Tour, the
circuit of possible future Control Data customers made without disclosing I
was being sent by CDC.  In May they would send me out again, this time flying
their flag, to look for computer manufacturers who might buy wodges of Tom
Kamp's excellent IBM-compatible magnetic tape drives.  But that tour comes in
later chapters.

<p>

I decided to describe the Secret Tour (48 visits in 39 days, including five
weekends) country by country, rather than consecutively day by day.  This was
so that I could make general remarks about a country in one chapter, as I had
in the final 96-page letter report to Norris I quote from so frequently.

<p>

For readers who are not at ease with such leapfrogging, I give a summary of
the Tour:

I drove most of Shrove Tuesday from Munich to Bern, dodging Basle as much as
possible because I had heard they were carnival-prone.  This is a curiosity
about the divided country: the French-speakers are Protestant, and of course
used to be Calvinist; the German side is Catholic, and has night clubs and
such - and Carnival!

<p>

I put up at the excellent Schweitzerhof, close to the wonderful railroad
station and offices and not far from the parliament buildings.  I had made an
appointment and hotel reservation from Monaco (don't remember why any more,
but it had an unforeseen result).  Telephoning first via the concierge to
confirm I was still expected, I walked across the street and met Hans Walter,
manager of the DP section of the Organization Department of the SBB, the Swiss
Federal Railroad.

<p>

We became quite friendly over the next years, and he and his people visited me
at the Bureau of Standards six or seven years later - and helped push my
Porsche out of the NBS parking lot in deep snow, says my slide collection!

<p>

In March 1962 Walter had IBM (and RemRand!) punched card equipment, a simple
1401, and a small 7070.  He had just finished remodelling part of an older
building; " ... a small but very well planned - even elegant - installation,"
I reported.  "First he does DP: payroll for 30,000 people, the largest by far
in all Switzerland; general bookkeeping; ticket accounting by agreement with
three other national railroads.  Next he wants to tackle OR stuff at the 7070
level - resource allocation, inventory control.  Then finally he is active in
committee aiming at daily freight-car reallocation, continent-wide ... He says
Swiss PTT is restrictive too, just as Muster of Krupp complained of German,
but he has the railroad's own teletype communications [tiny bandwidth] !!".

<p>

He took me to a spartan lunch in the executive dining room, and confused me by
ordering for me in Schweizert?tsch, of which the Bern version is unusually
uckky.  We had a long and cordial visit, and I suggested later to CDC that he
would be an ideal lead into a major 6600 proposal for a multi-national-
railroad center, quite possibly in Bern: "No real IBM competition at moment,
and NO 60% discount!"

<p>

I consulted him about my Thursday visit at CERN, the European Centre for
Nuclear Research in Geneva, where I was anxious to make a good connection.
The Aldermaston and Lillestr?m people had said they would call after my
visit and improve my entree, but the two sets of names they offered were
different, and I had had no followup.  Walter said I should go to the German
DP manager, assuring me he had good English, and immediately called him and
arranged a next-day visit.

<p>

Since it was for early morning, I reluctantly said my goodbyes, checked out at
the hotel, and drove the four hours to Geneva.  I rightly assumed hotel space
was easy on Ash Wednesday, but had the Bern concierge confirm me at the
Richemond just in case.  The CERN people directed impecunious physicists into
motels in adjacent France, but I knew better.

<p>

My visit was with a Dr. Lipps, head of the data handling section, " ... from
the Munich TH group, very cynical about Rem Rand [only 50 km away in Ouchy],
glassy-eyed about his 60% IBM discount (again!)  but has hopes of an ATLAS."
He was running one shift on a rented 709, but CERN owned a very large Ferranti
MERCURY and used it three shifts for general computing.

<p>

"Payroll is done by hand!" I laughed.  As for data reduction, bubble chamber
films were read semi-automatically (target track chosen and setting made by
eye, recorded by A/D converter onto paper tape.  "Paper tape goes into MERCURY
for first pass, comes out as magnetic tape (Ampex) which in six weeks from now
will be 729-compatible, then finishes up in the 709 ... "

<p>

Under recommendations I said, "I suggested he look into EECO, EPSCO,
Digitronics for some tape-tape converters.  Money is not too difficult here,
though not available on the Los Alamos scale."  They are clearly ready for at
least a 3600, I added, and maybe a 6600 "(but remember that 60%)".

<p>

As we got ready to go to lunch a call from the Richemond concierge came
through for me.  He read me a telegram from my father in Michigan; Mother had
died in her sleep the morning of Ash Wednesday.  I set him to work on air
passage to Detroit, thanked my hosts for their shocked sympathy, and rushed
back to downtown.

<p>

Mother was 75, not in good shape, but with no history of heart trouble.  I was
the only child.  My wife Elizabeth was tied down in Manhattan by her ailing
and much older Aunt Grace; I got her out of bed, told her the sad news, and
agreed I would go directly to Michigan for the funeral and then back track to
Sutton House.

<p>

The concierge, who knew only that I was going to CERN and had run me down
through the reception office, had reserved a seat on the 1430 plane and had my
bags packed and the bill ready when I returned (and probably had put off his
lunch hour to be there when I came).  I asked him as a special favor to see
that the Simca was garaged somewhere near the airport (cheaply; I assumed it
would be several weeks before I could return for it), and he assured me the
key would be at his desk for my disposition.  True European grand-hotel
service, and I needed it.

<p>

The story of how the telegram was handled took weeks to sort out.  If I had
taken a cheaper apartment in France, it probably would never have reached me,
but Monaco PTT services were excellent.  Dad had only my apartment address in
Monte-Carlo; when the PTT found I had no telephone they sent a messenger,
since it was a death notice.  He worked on the R?sidence Auteuil concierge,
who had only poor French, and the latter produced from his kitchen midden the
partial list of dates and hotels I had given him.

<p>

The PTT then telephoned the Bern Schweitzerhof; the concierge there said I had
been reserved in Geneva, and a copy of the US telegram was sent to the
Richemond.  No charges ever appeared.

<p>

After I got back to New York I called the realtor in Monte-Carlo to reassure
him I was sending a rent check, talked to a young lady with excellent English,
and she called the R?sidence concierge and told him I would be back in a
few weeks - and thanked him, I hope.

<p>

This chapter is about Swiss computers and my explorations for Control Data.  I
cannot remember the flight to Detroit, and I cannot remember how I managed the
visit reports.  The papers in front of me tonight are faded photocopies that
look more like black-on-white Ozalids, and they give only the dates of the
visits.  The fact that my handwritten date for the Bern visit is given as
6-3-62 (it was the 7th) is perhaps a clue that I wrote it later.

<p>

I had salvaged my papers, but not the big box of computer brochures and
manuals, from the back of the Simca before it was taken away, and was able to
produce the 96-page document for CDC and have it typed and multilithed while
in New York.  I flew back to Europe on April 15, but that is the start of
another chapter.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

Before I start around 1962 Europe again, I want to write about the good times
I had in the pages of what was then the bible of the Big Machine user
community.  I mentioned in Chapter 9 that the magazine started in 1957, and
the number of times I have referred to it and to its editors in later chapters
has attested to my close involvement, as a contributing editor [columnist] for
some years, and always as an appreciative reader.  For over twenty prosperous
years it told more of the story of our trade, first from what I will call the
Los Angeles perspective - tin airplanes, and IBM blue-suiters disguised in
sport jackets, and what went on in the RAND Corporation and at the Joint
Computer Conferences - than all the competition put together.

<p>

After the first two or three years it broadened out, began to tell at least an
American version of what was going on all over the computer world.  It did
fairly well into the Second Computer Revolution, when Ken Olsen and his
remarkable crew flooded us with minis.  It struggled with timesharing and that
ilk, although it never laughed at the later idiosyncracies of the business in
the gleeful fashion in which it had needled us early mainframers.

<p>

This was at least partly because, as it grew in size and in coverage, it was
quite naturally taken over by professional writers and editors.  Made it a
much more handsome affair, and sold advertising wonderfully, and poured
profits into Thompson Publishing.  And for historians who need to know about
the realities of the century's most remarkable accomplishment, as
distinguished from the fairy stories told in the stupid general media, the
self-serving stuff always available from public relations people, and the
indecipherable and often misleading academic journal articles, there was until
the late Seventies a pretty honest ongoing story in DATAMATION's pages.  But
the unique flavor and the humor came mostly from insiders, not from the
professionals, and dwindled away.

<p>

It was later indistinguishable from a hundred competitors, and buried in a
heap of daily and weekly trade newspapers and a thousand variegated
newsletters.  But in the early years it was great!

<p>

I saw a copy of the start-up magazine RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING while
gallivanting around Tempe, and immediately signed up for a free copy.  When
the editorial office moved to Los Angeles and the conversion to the final name
was complete [January 1958] my interest increased.  Then Paul Armer and
Freddie Gruenberger began reporting on the invitational meetings at RAND, and
I appeared as a frequent and pungent commentator.

<p>

Suddenly the new editor, Sandy Lanzarotta, appointed me "contributing editor"
[November 1959] and I was always between Number Four and Number Six on the
masthead until January 1964, although moving to Europe reduced my presence in
the pages after mid-1962.  In the thirty or so issues during that period, I
contributed twenty articles and made other appearances
I got paid, although not much - $75 or $100 a month.  And I never knew whether
the "editorial advisers", who included Dan McCracken, got paid also; they
wrote less frequently, and were not called editors.  Bob Patrick, who started
out as an adviser, was closer to the publication (in California) and actually
took over as acting editor for a couple of issues when Sandy's successor, Hal
Bergstein, got seriously bunged up on the freeways.

<p>

The first RAND Symposium published in DATAMATION reported the 1959 sessions.
To give some of the flavor - remember that the material was expurgated! - here
is an exchange between the late Saul Gorn and me on ACM and business data
processing:

<p>
<blockquote>


Gorn: .... Essentially, you're talking about something much bigger; something
that even Ed Berkeley [founder of ACM, in 1947] didn't recognize.

<p>

Grosch: .... there were clear clues later of what should have been done
.... We had, for example,the first announcement of LEO's success in England.
Then there were the early attempts to get UNIVACs and 701s working on business
problems.  It was perfectly obvious that there would be a great deal of
experimentation on using the machines for business, and yet the Alts and the
Householders brushed it all aside and made it quite clear they couldn't care
less.

<p>

Gorn: Well, at least now the Alts and the Hammings and the Householders are
beginning to feel the way we do.

<p>

Grosch: Yes, but they are improving at the rate of one month per year and the
world is going ahead at the rate of twelve months per year.

<p>
</blockquote>

This went on for many closely-printed pages in two issues, and was read and
debated up and down the trade.

<p>

As Bergstein and his much-loved successor Bob Forest began to draw heavy
advertising, the publishers - who had only been looking for tax benefits in
1957, and certainly not to create a major trade-journalistic triumph - began
a much-appreciated series of parties at the Joints.  These were in their eyes
for the advertisers, and were therefore quite lavish, with adorable bowls of
shrimp and impressive ice sculptures and endless trays of hot goodies.  And of
course there were bars in every corner of the event room.

<p>

The editorial offices gave out much-desired fancy invitations.  Some came in
the mail, but most were handed out cautiously at the DATAMATION booth in the
exhibit area in the early hours of the conference.  It was first assumed that
the advertisers would enjoy meeting the users and the prospective customers,
but in the end the business people severed the two parts and held a smaller
thank-you party for advertisers and let the by-then-famous bigger bash proceed
unhampered.

<p>

It became such an attraction in the Seventies that a serious filtering,
usually managed by my old friend Charlie Asmus, had to be set up at the
entrance.  The major figures brought spouses or dates, many of whom were a
considerable draw in themselves.  It was a part of the DATAMATION mystique,
and was operated by Bob Forest in particular as a prime highlight of the
twice-a-year conferences.

<p>

There was an interesting interplay with content.  Many of the more sedate
academic and governmental authorities were dubious about trade publications,
and interviews, and writing articles (without compensation, if the editors
could manage it).  But even the stuffiest wanted to come to the DATAMATION
Party, especially if their spouses were in attendance and liked shrimp and ice
sculptures.  Or booze!

<p>

So Hal and Bob and his successor John Kirkley made sure authors and potential
authors and the authorities that they wanted famous DMN reporters like Phil
Hirsch and Angie Pantages to have access to, got invitations.  As the fame of
the affairs spread, this paid major editorial dividends, and Bob and John used
this to keep the publishers supportive and the meatballs coming.

<p>

There were experiments.  For two years the magazine went semi-monthly, and
still was comfortably swollen with advertising, but the strain was too much -
and COMPUTERWORLD, a weekly, was beginning to draw heavily from the readership
and to a lesser extent from the advertising.  So that version was abandoned.

<p>

On the other hand, emphasis and reader interest turned heavily toward
international matters and international computer trade, so a separate
department of sometimes fifty pages or more was inserted into a so-called
International Edition.  I had a place on the special masthead of the insert
when it was run by Angie, partly because of my overseas activities and partly
because I was a bridge between the old "insider" gang of the Sixties and the
professional journalism and prosperity of the Seventies.

<p>

I might forget to mention it later on, so I will parallel the mention of the
semimonthly enterprise with mention of another Forest contribution.  The
Spring and Fall Joint Computer Conferences were a huge huge success for many
years, but in the end the expense of the giant booth constructions and the
shipment or local employment of large numbers of special exhibitor people
began to tell.  The exhibitors complained, pointing out that they also had to
support specialist exhibits in areas like banking, and major operations in
Hannover and S?o Paulo and wherever.  They set up an advisory group and put
Bob Forest at its head: the apogee of DATAMATION influence.  It recommended
one "Joint" a year, and I told the story in the 25th Anniversary [AFIPS]
conference proceedings.  It began:

<p>
<blockquote>

The Joints are no more, at least in name - but long live the NCCs!  I suffered
the agonies of grim Philadelphia at the very first Joint [1951], not yet named
"Eastern."  I enjoyed the dubious sunshine of Los Angeles at the first
Western, not yet named "Joint."  I was on the JCC Board twenty years later
when, hoping to retrieve the big exhibitors of the Sixties, our Industry
Advisory Panel told us:

<p>
<blockquote>
"The time is out of Joint;"
</blockquote>
<p>

and we replied, each one of us,

<p>
<blockquote>
"O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right"!
</blockquote>
<p>

And we coined the name, National Computer Conference, to mark the creation of
something new, yet old: still joint, but of all the AFIPS societies; no longer
Joint, or Western, or Eastern, or Spring, or Fall.

</blockquote>
<p>

That paper went on to give a conspectus of the 45 Joints held in those first
25 years.  There were many more - once a year, as Forest had urged - but the
for-profit competition waxed and waxed, and the conferences died, and AFIPS
with them.

<p>

DATAMATION recorded it all.  Pungently!

<p>

After Mother's funeral I had to go back quickly to New York and work up my
report for Norris.  I was concerned about my father, but could see he was
surrounded by old and dear friends, and in fact did not seem too upset by the
completely unexpected death.  I guessed that he had had warnings he was not
telling me about, perhaps because he felt he should have written.  I never
knew.

<p>

Elizabeth was anxious to help, but relieved that there seemed to be no need to
uproot him from Michigan and his friends.  Our finances were too unsettled to
contemplate moving to quarters that he could fit into, and neither of us could
imagine him in Manhattan.

<p>

We did persuade him to come visit for a week, and put him up at a nearby small
hotel, which he found uncomfortable because of the exotic UN clientele.  After
much puzzling we took him to a famous old-fashioned restaurant in Brooklyn,
Gage and Tollner's, but the expedition was a failure; he hated the subway, and
was outraged at the prices on the menu (Elizabeth and I had thought them
surprisingly reasonable compared to midtown Manhattan!).

<p>

He got along with old Aunt Grace better than with us, but she was disturbed at
his detachment over Mother's death.  So all four of us were glad when the
visit ended.

<p>

I had laid on two visits to Minneapolis at the end of March, with a quick trip
to Phoenix to check on General Electric's situation in between.  I missed my
good friend Grady, still dominating my memories of what had been rechristened
Arizona State University.  He had died unexpectedly in 1959, not long after
showing up at Sutton House and spending a wonderful evening with Elizabeth and
Grace and Deo.  We had all loved him.

<p>

The visits to CDC were creepy.  Nobody wanted to discuss my 96-page
letter-report, even to criticize it.  Nobody wanted to talk about Europe, or
orders in the U.S.  - although the 1961 Annual Report which I picked up at my
Minneapolis hotel (!!) said they were beginning the long run of orders for big
machines which Surly Seymour was fathering.

<p>

I finally was introduced to Tom Kamp, who had an IBM-compatible magnetic tape
drive coming into full production in the new factory.  This was the 606; it
looked just like the 729 drives on the 7090s and the new 7094s, but had been
considerably cleaned up and made (Kamp claimed) a great deal more reliable,
and needing less fiddly maintenance.  Miles very reluctantly admitted that,
yes, a price had been set for OEM orders.

<p>

"Overseas?" I asked.  Well, yes - most of the U.S. companies were doing their
own or buying from Ampex.  Also I guessed that really large orders might be
embarrassing; the new factory was about the size of the tape drive shipping
area in Poughkeepsie!

<p>

I pressured Miles (Norris made himself unavailable).  "Why don't you let me
peddle this very nice gadget around to the dozen or so European computer
manufacturers, this time with your name clearly associated with the product?"
I said.  I pointed out Control Data could sell 606s and later peripherals
(they were monkeying with a check sorter, for instance, on the same
clean-design basis) to someone like Zuse or Stantec, or maybe even to one of
the Big Boys that was fumbling with mainframe production.

<p>

One clear signal I had picked up in Minnesota was that the idea of a CDC spare
parts and maintenance center somewhere in Western Europe or Britain was much
less scary than a full entry with several offices, a computer center for
backup and customer practice [at least a 1604A and several 160As], and a bunch
of expensive American deportees.  And a service depot!  I kept quiet with an
effort, sensing painful arguments going on with directors and such.

<p>

Finally another fancy contract appeared at Sutton House, even more
legalese-ridden than the first.  It essentially said yes, talk Control Data -
but for Gossakes don't close any deals!!  However, it did have a price list
attached.  The good sign was that my list of OEMers was incorporated.  The
familiar bad signs were Minneapolis whining about prorating days, and on and
on.

<p>

There seemed to be no Jim Miles in it, and no Tom Kamp; just lawyers and
beancounters.  But I looked at the rate and the number of days: $200 a day for
not more than twenty days.  I groused to my handsome wife.  I groused to
Grace.  I groused to D?odat.  But I signed.

<p>

The agreement was dated 11 April [1962].  I still have my copy.

<p>

The little Simca Ranch was garaged somewhere in Geneva, hopefully full of
brochures and papers from my first tour.  I was still an Air France fan, but
no longer keen on Orly, so I chose to fly Scandinavian, which by this time was
doing DC8 nonstops to Kastrup.  After a night at as I remember the Hafnia, a
couple of great meals, a survey of the sex shops, and a call to Niels Bech
arranging to see him at the end of the month, I caught a Swissair Caravelle
for Cointrin.

<p>

I arrived in Geneva on the 17th of April, just six weeks from my hurried
departure.  The concierge at the Richemonde was every bit as welcoming as I
had expected.  Yes, on receiving my night letter he had had the "little car"
as he called it, made ready for my advent.  Yes [sympathetic tones] he had
paid the bill for me, and the wagon would be delivered to the front door in
the morning whenever I wanted it.  Fabulous!  True, it cost the earth, but I
had desperately needed the service.

<p>

I did not call CERN or even think about the last two computing shops I had
planned to visit, but set out for Monaco next day with a huge sigh of relief.
(And yes, all the papers were perfectly safe: Switzerland!).

<p>

There was a lot of household chores, and of course I needed to reassure the
puzzled agents that I still existed by paying two months back rent.  I tried
to thank the concierge, who spoke mostly non-Castilian Spanish, for his part
in helping with my father's cable back in March and found him vague, but
anxious to accept an American $20 bill.

<p>

I had disloyally begun to look around Nice for a place to sell the little
estate wagon, since I was planning to get another Super Car if my finances
held up, and AutoEurope back in Manhattan did not take tradeins.  After a
couple of weeks of this sort of personal stuff, however, I girded my loins -
or at least packed another set of clean shirts - and set out again on the
consulting trail.

<p>

Leaving Ranch parked at the side of the R?sidence, I took a curious but
cheap bus to the C?te-d'Azur airport at the foot of the Var and boarded an
Alitalia Caravelle.  The end of the alpine chain coming down to the sea looked
wonderful out of the left first-class window, but the 45-minute flight was too
short for even a snack.  Linate was as disorganized as ever, but I wangled a
green and black Fiat taxi in to the Continentale, where they recognized me.

<p>

I had the portiere call and confirm my arrival to Roberto's secretary, and
sure enough, next morning an elegantly chauffeured Lancia sedan swept me away,
to the satisfaction of the doorman, who much preferred it to my own Simca.

<p>

This was my first visit to the electronics lab at Borgolombardo.  I have a
record of the address, 33, via del Parliamento, but absolutely no recollection
of what it looked like; strange.  I was welcomed by a Martin Friedman, one of
the Olivetti Canadians, who said he was the man in charge of peripheral gear,
but before I could open my folder Olivetti himself appeared, and wanted to
confirm in pleasant detail that I had also been working for Control Data on my
previous visit.  This somewhat confused the young engineer, who had not heard
about it from Roberto or from his late boss Mario Tchou.

<p>

This is a good place to reflect on my curious but pleasant relationships with
the third-generation Olivetti and the second-generation Ferranti.  They were
easy, I'd guess looking back, because I was not a salaried employee or a
for-fee consultant.  When Bill Norris or Tom Watson looked at me they knew I
was under control.  Roberto Olivetti saw me as a senior figure full of
valuable insights, the extraction of which was made easier by warm treatment.
And Boz Ferranti started the same way, and over a good many years came to be
genuinely a friend, with yarns about his hobbies, and nice relations between
our wives.

<p>

I remember years later, long after IBM had had me removed from my fancy job at
the Bureau of Standards and there was no prospect of any further formal
interaction, having a lengthy and friendly conversation with Tom Junior about
his sailing enthusiasms and his family's participation.  And later still, the
Wild Duck birthday present.  Fits the above.

<p>

Anyhow, on this visit we were very much at ease.  Friedman took over and
explained that as far as my interest in tape drives was concerned, he had 150
Ampex units on order for the coming ELEA 7003s planned for 1962 and 1963, and
thought it very unlikely those could be derailed.  Roberto said the new 6001<br>
might need something much fancier, in what was then referred to in the trade
as the Hypertape range (from the IBM units supposedly being delivered with
STRETCH).

<p>

I was able to tell them that such drives were only under development in IBM,
not in production, and that from what little - and I was frank that it was
little - I had seen of Tom Kamp, he was likely to do as well or better than
Poughkeepsie.

<p>

My report said, "Would in any case want to manufacture complete drive, buying
only the first 50-100 (and even these without electronics but with heads).
Roberto O. would like to discuss such with Kamp and Norris.  Also Friedman
would like to visit plant when he is in Canada in July.  Roberto O. more
interested in the men, less in the machine."

<p>

I added, "No indication when or if they plan to go heavily outside Italy - I
asked outright and was brushed off.  They are building a high-speed printer
[in Ivrea?] you might want to look at."

<p>

For follow-up action I suggested "further top-level contact", and that
Friedman might be invited to Minneapolis.  To the best of my knowledge neither
thing happened.  Sad!

<p>

Roberto took me to his office for lunch, which I remember vaguely as
British-style "Cut Sandwiches", presumably washed down with San Pelligreno.  I
had a brief session with him about Tchou's death on the autostrada, and asked
to be considered as he reorganized around the loss.  But I could see he wanted
only a hardware man, although I gently pointed out that Tchou had done
software and personnel tasks as well, which I claimed to be very good at.  I
had time to wander around the Galleria and the Duomo.  In spite of it being a
Monday [May 7], there was a major performance at La Scala, accounting for the
second-class room I had been given at the hotel, which was only a block from
the opera house. I watched from the da Vinci statue across the street that
evening as limousine after limousine unloaded fancy fancy Milanese, and have
over many decades told the story of the beautiful young couple who arrived in
a two-seater Ferrari and left it standing in front of the La Scala entrance,
in a swarm of limos and taxis, and walked regally into the building.  The
doorman and hangers-on pushed the gorgeous vehicle to the side; I assume the
driver reclaimed it after the performance!!

<p>

It felt good to be at work again, and especially to be able to talk freely
about my client, whom I really was quite happy to be representing.  I thought
Norris was great, in a rather special ex-Arlington-Hall way and liked Tom Kamp
a lot more than Surly Seymour Cray.  And just as the Italian start of the
first tour had been exciting, so this Olivetti visit had been good.  I flew
away to England with great expectations.

<p>

The Savoy was its familiar sophisticated self, except that there were many
more Americans, and especially American women, than there had been three
months before.  Only weatherproof business visitors brave the glooms and
chills of February London, but it was now lovely May on the Embankment.
Encouraged by generally nice weather all over Europe, I had let the
Monte-Carlo agency put me on a morning flight, and had been pleased with a
first-class First Class Alitalia breakfast.  The line for Aliens at Heathrow
Immigration was not too bad, my bag came off without incident, and even the
ride in from the airport was easy.

<p>

I had time not only to inspect the gigantic bathroom and fantasy Edwardian
plumbing of my high-up room, but to get down to the Grill early enough to not
need a reservation.  I had a light lunch, stared for a few minutes at the
Savoy Theatre posters, and strolled up Piccadilly to the ICT building at 149
Park Lane.

<p>

There was a small embarrassment at the Reception, since I had addressed my
long night letter to the wrong Colonel Davies - there turned out to be two,
not related [and probably not from the same regiment!].  When I produced my
reply telegram, however, the male secretary who had signed it appeared and
took me upstairs to the office of the correct colonel (J.A.), who as I had
been warned was not in London that day, and told me it was at my disposal.
Nice!

<p>

He then produced a Mr. J.K. Draper, head of Peripheral Equipment Engineering,
and a David Antrich from marketing.  Antrich knew of me from the February
visit, which he already understood had also been on behalf of Control Data.
After some fairly penetrating drolleries about midwest caution, we settled to
business.  Turned out The Right Davies ("happens all the time!") was in
Germany all week.

<p>

"Stuttgart?" I asked, meaning SEL.  No, visiting his son's family, they said;
"Wonderful weather for it", we agreed.

<p>
<blockquote>

"Would like to discuss the drive in detail, and test one in their own shop
quite soon.  Draper says his development budget will not stand a purchase;
said they had very first production TM2 Ampex over here (prototype went to
Olivetti) and that they did a great deal to advance Ampex rep[utation?] on the
Continent and in the U.K.  Now feel they should examine the alternatives.
Would like (1) to have two or three of you come over, see their shop (which I
have not done), determine possible back-scratching areas, tell more about the
606.  Then (2) if it still looks good, they would suggest a loan of one unit
for perhaps 6 months.  They feel your price is very high but can be earned
back by sufficiently good reliability and ease of maint. and repair.
Discussion about use of air guides, power supply (would have to be 50 cycle
except for loan machine), track format (they don't want IBM 7-track, but ?"
[physical tape] is OK).  Apparently they have 10-channel format in mind.  I
believe interest is genuine and probably fruitful."

</blockquote>
<p>

I counseled sending a team "second or third week in June", including a Draper
type and someone who could negotiate the loan of a drive.  As I saw while
helping a couple of months later, the "Draper type" was a CDC engineer named
Thorndyke, and he did indeed make a European swing, in connection with the
Munich IFIP conference, but that was August, not June.  I watched the
beginnings of a relationship at that time, and Norris himself came over (by
ocean liner!) in November, but I was regrettably not part of that later
contact.  DATAMATION reported the subsequent flurries but then lost interest.
In fairness to Control Data, I have to say they had an awful lot on their
plate all through the early Sixties, and not just internationally!

<p>

Here I should make mention of the ICT provenance.  In January 1959 the two
office machinery outfits British Tab[ulating Machine Company] and Powers-Samas
[Accounting Machines Ltd.] had merged to form International Computers and
Tabulators Limited: ICT.  British Tab had been the Hollerith, square-hole,
punched card machine vendor and Powers-Samas, the round-hole.  Each had been
recalcitrant vassals of their much larger U.S. counterparts, IBM and RemRand.
Now freed, they were threatened by the appearance of IBM U.K. Ltd.  and
Remington Rand Ltd.

<p>

By 1962 they had acquired the computing business of EMI [Electric and Musical
Industries], which made them the reluctant parent of the Emidec 1101s and
2400s.  But much more important, they had been trapped by RCA back in New
Jersey into a strange exchange arrangement, non-exclusive, where they got RCA
501s by the dozen and RCA got a fair number of ICT card readers and such
(making it possible to offer "IBM" peripherals without dealing with 590).

<p>

This was paralleled by the similar arrangements I have noted in Sweden and
France, and amazingly with English Electric in Britain.  Also Olivetti was
involved with Bull, although nobody in Milano ever mentioned it to me, so
through Bull they too had access to RCA 501 information.  To this day I marvel
at how some brilliant RCA executive - who knows, maybe Fred Farwell? - had
hornswoggled all these foreigners, and how some other RCAer had managed later
to chuck it all away.

<p>

One trouble I am having in writing this is that I see my own insider dope
being played back to me without attribution in research reports from a Wall
Street firm I consulted for in 1963 and 1964!!

<p>

I must mention that most remarkable ICT competitor, J. Lyons &amp; Co., who in
addition to operating a thousand tea shops up and down the British Isles was
building and selling LEO IIIs against the ICT 1301s and the ICT/RCA 1500s.
And doing it with less than a thousand bods, against ICT's 22 thousand!

<p>

I went to see Leo Computers Ltd. in North Acton, a London industrial suburb.
I already knew Dr.  J.M.M. Pinkerton, their key technical man since 1948, and
thought very highly indeed of him.  As a Cambridge man he knew all about
Wilkes and EDSAC, although he had not worked directly for Maurice, so the LEO
[Lyons Electronic Office] architecture sat well with him.

<p>

The IIIs were using Ampex drives, and it was clear that these had a big
technical advantage over Potter (or Decca, a sort of English Potter).  IBM was
far too expensive, and apparently very hard to deal with in their new
U.K. corporate form.  So the Kamp 606 and its probable successors drew
Pinkerton's interest.

<p>
<blockquote>

"Showed me an Ampex being checked out for #3 Leo III, which was being built up
[went to British Rubber, I think].  I was startled by genuine air of
accomplishment and optimism; Leo may really stay in business ....  Lyons gives
them some help, but mostly in corporate staff support (lawyers).  New
expansion into second bldg. just finished - I estimate 400 employees [North
Acton]."

</blockquote>
<p>

I noted they were not offering trades "? la ICT", but warned their probable
production was small.  This turned out not to be true, at least in British
terms: seventy IIIs were sold, eight of them overseas.  I had seen evidence of
a Leo IV during my visit, and Pinkerton said they would want more advanced
tapes for it.  Readers will meet Leo for the last time when ICT gets turned
into ICL at a piping of the haggis in Edinburgh.

<p>

Another London-based visit was to Elliott's, Elliott Bros. Ltd. to be formal,
which was in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.  I noted in my final report some
weeks later that they did not seem serious about the DP end of the business.
In the earlier trip report I was quite negative:

<p>
<blockquote>

"....  they are extremely limited by their relationship with National Cash;
all marketing of their line items which might use (or already use) mag. tape
is via NCR except in the U.K. and perhaps the U.S. ....  They plan on TM4
Ampex but do not seem to actually have one in house - they make own paper tape
and card readers and are obviously keen on supplying those.  Also they are
heavily committed intellectually to new work in the control and military areas
...."

</blockquote>
<p>

My host was one R.L. Cook, assistant manager of the development operation.  He
was polite, not distant - but I felt general purpose computers were not his
Great Love.  Pinkerton, now ...

<p>

I had been puzzled for some years by hints from English friends, notably at
NPL, that the EMI enterprise, which was then and even today is usually thought
of as in the entertainment end of electronics, had done interesting laboratory
work and not just lashed together the usual components.  Then the National
Insurance scheme, which like Social Security in the U.S. had enormous tape
files, announced its choice of the Emidec 2400 (1-inch tapes and an early Rank
Xerox printer).

<p>

The business press carried the story of the ICT acquisition, and Stan Gill
sent me a copy of the little DSIR [Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research] ADP book.  So it was with sharp interest that I took a green bus to
Hayes, out beyond London Airport in Middlesex.  I had an introduction to one
W.J.  Talbot, chief engineer of the computer division - not from Gill, but
from Bram Loopstra of Electrologica.  However, the story of my newly-announced
connection to Minneapolis had preceded me; the trip report I filed that
evening [May 11] back at the Savoy said:

<p>
<blockquote>

"These guys were laying for me.  The story is that they cannot afford American
prices unless there is a heavy quid pro quo (although they are heavily Ampex
TM4 already).  So they want to sell you thin-film memories which are working
in 256-word prototype right now, in 0.3 ?s range I think."

</blockquote>
<p>

I went on to suspect that they didn't really care about the CDC drive,
although indeed they also had a Potter ["not the high density one"] on
evaluation.  They had an American outpost in West Hartford, featuring a former
team member named Dick Booth, and I was startled that EMI wanted the Kamp
people to contact him!  And indeed, the absorption of the division into ICT
seemed more important to me, since the contacts I was trying to promote on
Park Lane would in theory lead toward the thin film experiment in the end.

<p>

From 1996, that seems optimistic, especially since I had seen under De Carlo
and Benton how warfare raged between IBM sites!  And the IBM outfits had grown
up together, while the parts of ICT - and even more, of the successor ICL -
had been forcibly juxtaposed.

<p>

They did not feed me lunch, or offer to help me get back into town.  As was so
often the case in Europe and the U.K., there did not seem to be any smooth
marketing types, in blue suits or otherwise, in the engineering outfits.
Ferranti was trying to be an exception, but I was already inside the door with
Boz And Co., so I didn't have a balanced judgement.

<p>

I managed to struggle back in time for a call at the New Southgate offices of
Stantec, Standard Telephones and Cables, in North London.  This was the part
of the British ITT enterprise doing digital switching computers and such, and
they told me quite frankly that now that Zebra had run out they were not going
to stay in DP.  I yearned to tell them of my adventures with Marc deFerranti
and Horrid Harold, but thought it impolitic (as perhaps hurting CDC).

<p>

Dr. G.G. Smith, chief engineer of switching development, was indeed planning
to buy some sort of tape drives:

<p>
<blockquote>

"....  in fair profusion in digital switching computers and equipments.  They
need full-time on-line 24h/day, 7d/week, 52wk/year reliability with as little
redundant equipment as possible.  Some centrals will only want 1 or 2 drives,
so redundancy there is very painful."

</blockquote>
<p>

He and his people also raised the question of using British components, which
would be easy for IBM U.K. but nearly impossible for some years for Control
Data.  I was sorry; looked like a real opportunity, but one that CDC was not
ready for.

<p>

I spent part of the Saturday on pleasure in Charing Cross bookstores and some
intriguing Soho extensions into fairly hard softcore.  But I also had reports
to send out, and a call to make back to Elizabeth in New York, who had to tell
me neither Grace nor Deo were doing well.  Also she had telephoned my father a
couple of times and found him still unhappy with his son and daughter-in-law
but planning automobile trips with a woman friend.

<p>

I was delighted for him, and was able to tell her (at considerable expense to
CDC) that this friend was Frieda Johnson, the mother of the handsome girl I
had dated in my junior year of high school in Royal Oak!!  Frieda Senior had
also been the owner of the house my parents had rented while I was in college,
and had been a widow for some years.  Dad had a nice Plymouth, and was anxious
to see some of the U.S. Dorothy and I, and Elizabeth, had been describing to
him for decades.

<p>

Monday morning early I flew up to Manchester, giving up my Savoy room
reluctantly.  There was a Ferranti car waiting to take me directly to the West
Gorton factory, which was new to me.  I had a warm welcome from Boz, Peter
Hall [then General Manager of the Computer Division], and several submissive
juniors.  Parenthetically, I was itching to see if Peter also had a fancy
executive dining room, and if he was an expert at carving - but alas! they
took me out to lunch.

<p>

I already knew from the ATLAS brochures and operating manual that it was
wide-tape, although Boz informed me they were putting one IBM 729 drive on
Jack Howlett's machine at Harwell, along with eight FR300s.  Peter told me
they had a big contract with Ampex to supply TM2s for the ORIONs.  I said:

<p>
<blockquote>

... " 'over half a million pounds' but volume is greater than that, so
presumably they are reachable - but only by wide tape!  They also raise
question of 50-cycle system - ask if you plan to change diameter of capstans
to maintain 150 ips speed.  Do you?"  [Kamp never told me, but presumably
Thorndyke brought answers in August].

</blockquote>
<p>

I had to say that unless CDC would either consider wide tape or talk Hypertape
specs neither Peter Hall nor Boz himself were anxious to meet.  I was amused
to find out that Norris' tough way of talking was known in Manchester (and
hence, all over the British Isles), and was not admired.  I did not report the
feeling, nor that I had said I felt the same!

<p>

Peter had to go back to work after lunch, but Boz was hungry for computer
stories (and laughed his head off at my yarn about Frieda Johnson).  He said
he wished I had time to be social, and that he wanted me to meet his wife,
"who doesn't believe my stories about you and Tahiti and flying off the
Riffelberg".  I put this down to gentility, having never met even Robbie's
American wife, let alone Tom Junior's.  But later on, I did - different wife
by then, though!

<p>

A company car took me back to town and delivered me to the fabulous Midland
Hotel, where Peter's secretary had quartered me.  Downtown Manchester was
still pretty grim, redevelopment not yet having started, but the food at the
French Restaurant made up for it.  I noted there was also a carvery; this was
many years before the invasion of fast foods [although there was a Wimpy's in
Soho!].

<p>

I don't remember how I travelled to English Electric Kidsgrove the next
morning; would expect to find a rental car in my expense accounts, and there
isn't one.  But through the offices of Les Fox I had a date with the chief
engineer of the computer division, a Mr. Asbury.  His staff gave me a brisk
tour of both the KDP-10 area (the RCA machine), of which two had actually been
delivered, and the indigenous KDF-9, which as Fox had warned me was not quite
ready to ship.  Because the latter machine was to use drives from the KDP-10,
which were being manufactured in Kidsgrove to the RCA designs, the whole
outfit was IBM-narrow-tape equipped, but in no need of the 606.

<p>

Moreover, since their costs were so much below Camden's, the CDC price was far
too high.  Nevertheless, Asbury was cordial, and said he would be glad to meet
his Control Data counterparts if they "came by".  I noted somewhat sadly that
none of the men I met were planning to go to Munich, while a large number of
Ferranti hardware and software types were going.  It brought back the
animadversions of the Norwegians in February.

<p>

It is worth noting that while the DSIR book mentions the [moderate]
time-sharing capabilities of the KDF-9, no one at Kidsgrove seemed familiar
with the idea.  Oxford would have to do its own software, obviously!

<p>

I had been introduced to MetVickers, Metropolitan Vickers, the day of my first
visit to Ferranti.  They had now changed their name to AEI, Associated
Electrical Industries, but were still offering the rather big 1010, with few
takers.  I had been told in February that the entire team was engaged in
designing and building a probably-one-off AEI 1100 for the Royal Air Force
supply operation, reminding me of the IBM 701 sent to the Naval Aviation
Supply office ten years before.  The application:

<p>
<blockquote>

"....  is touted over here as the world's largest file processing case (maybe
it even is, although the pieces of our military stuff may be bigger than their
whole package).  They would jump at 150,000 char/sec drives of almost any
physical characteristic, mostly because of reel capacity.  The machine I saw
had 15 TM-2s connected with more coming! .... a small department of a
tremendous company; reminds me of GE Phoenix and its ERMA days!"

</blockquote>
<p>

I respected the dedication.  But I remembered the struggles when pioneer tube
machines like BIZMAC and the big Raytheon were built under similar forced
draft.  I told the Minneapolis boys this was a cinch if they could produce a
super tape or Hypertape quickly, but not to plan on furnishing 606s.

<p>

And when I ate haggis to welcome the birth of ICL [1968] I noted that of all
the 1962 firms swept up in that conglomerate, only AEI had not stayed the
course.  That 1100 contract was a killer.

<p>

The nine days in England had gone by as in a dream.  It had been downhill from
ICT to AEI, but to see vibrant shops like Leo (!!!) and Ferranti's made up for
the problem sites.  I paid my bill at the Midland, noting that I was no longer
regarded as an impoverished IBM victim, but an expense-accounted traveling
salesman.  I caught an Air France Caravelle and headed for Orly.

The Caravelle from Manchester to Paris Orly was familiar transportation; in
fact, of the twelve flights I took inside Europe on this shorter mission, ten
were in these oval-windowed and underpowered jets.  I had only the normal
vexations of a Wednesday at the airport, notably a shortage of taxis, and
arrived at the Lotti in good spirits.

<p>

I had worked hard in England, and my appointment at 94, avenue Gambetta was
fairly late the next morning [17 May], so I asked Josef the concierge to work
on reservations for the evening, and set off for the bookstores and art
galleries of the Left Bank.

<p>

I have forgotten where I ate, but well remember this was my introduction to
the Alcazar.  I had seen the Lido show both on the Champs-?lys?es and in
Vegas. but this was very different: much less a spectacle, much more
sophisticated.  I remember this as the night I learned how to get a Paris taxi
in spite of the end-of-show mob scene: much as in Times Square, but made
simpler by the size differentiation of French currency!

<p>

I had arranged with Phil Dreyfus that I would talk first to the Bull
peripherals people, and ask them to call him when both parties had had enough.
I asked therefore for Jean Rollet, who was chief engineer of one division.  He
brought several youngsters with him, who all apologized in English much better
than my French for not having English, and we settled down for tape talk.

<p>

Bull was using both the RCA drives I had heard of at English Electric and
indigenous ones from Compteurs.  In my report I said I had tried to get
"competitive information" but could only be sure that as installed on early
small Gammas the French drives were low-performance.

<p>

Rollet said that over a dozen Gamma 60s had been shipped, and that the third
one was running at the Belgian PTT.  I doubted both statements, and knew for
sure that the one supplied to EdF, the French power company [Number 2, they
said], was not doing well.  Dreyfus said the railroad installation [also
supposedly Number 2] was a big success, probably because he had done a lot of
the specialized programs himself (the term "software" was a few years in the
future).

<p>

They seemed genuinely interested in the complete IBM compatibility, asking
questions about hub specifications and air film thicknesses and such.  I said
CDC planned to furnish 50~ drives, but that samples for Bull - they were
asking about trials starting in four months - would have to be 60~, 110v, and
glossed over the availability of a French-speaking CDC installations engineer.

<p>

I told Rollet I was not able to talk about quantity discounts, but that his
suggestion of an order for 500 units would undoubtedly stimulate offers.  And
I noted in my report that Bull was not pushing either honestly or as a matter
of reverse engineering for Hypertape-level hardware, as I had heard in
Britain.

<p>

We shook hands all round, in the European fashion, and one of the young men
took me back to the reception and turned me over to Dreyfus.  Phil bustled me
out to a company car and off we went.  He was excited; anxious to show me his
baby, and to prove that it was doing real work.  It would be in full spate
tomorrow, working on the monster railroad monthly payroll, he said, pressing
me for my schedule.  We settled on early afternoon, and that this same car
would pick me up at S.E.A. in Courbevoie.  He told the driver to be sure to
recognize me (I got the word visage!).  I had hoped for a gossip session, but
he passed up my suggestion of the Lotti bar and was driven away.  I memorized
the license plate on the Citroen!

<p>

The factory and offices of what I recorded on my visit report as SEPSEA were
at 138, bd. du Verdun, and pretty dingy.  This was a unit of S.E.A.,
Societ? d'Electronique et Automatisme, about which I knew very little.  I
quote from my report:

<p>
<blockquote>

Their products include the CAB500 (two more just installed at the Credit
Lyonnaise) and new CAB3900.  Each uses ?" tape in a drive made by Compteurs
to SEA design or specification (big difference, but I had some difficulty with
that one!).  These run about 50 char/in and 200 in/sec and look rather
fragile.  Riou [R. Riou, assistant general manager of S.E.A.] showed me a
continuous-loop transport, constant-running, using ?" tape and 8 tracks
(error correcting?), with a random pileup bin holding 650 feet (!!) of tape,
or 65000 words.  Rather nice, if you don't mind waiting up to 40 seconds for
your word.  They plan to use it on automation equipment (probably machine tool
control??).  They will digest CDC info and get in touch for further words.

</blockquote>
<p>

That meant 48-bit words, or 36-bit if there was two channels of redundancy.  I
said the probability of business was 0.2, that it would be sale rather than
lease, and the order would in any case only be for "a few".

<p>

Riou took me to lunch.  I liked the informality and the engineering-management
flavor.  It reminded me of a smaller Elliott's.  But when I thought about
what, say, Ramo-Wooldridge was doing back in Aerospace Country ...

<p>

I had mentioned the Bull car was coming for me, and Riou considerately had me
at the gate promptly at 1430.  Turned out to be the same driver but a newer
Citroen!

<p>

After a couple of repeats I understood we were going directly to the CFF
installation.  This was Chemins de Fer Fran?ais, the enormous French
national railroad system.  It now operates the TGVs, terrific Trains de Grand
Vitesse, and the early interest in high technology that Bull was catering to
was a harbinger of that future.  The Swiss, as I described in Chapter 41, ran
a more efficient railroad, but the French wanted a lot more speed!

<p>

Apparently the giant power company and the giant railroad had competed for the
first Gamma 60.  Carteron claimed he got the Number Two [p.381] and the CFF
machine was supposed to be the earliest one outside Bull itself.  I suspect
that the failure at EdF was what got Dreyfus to do the CFF programming - or at
least manage it - which points to the railroad machine as either being Number
Four, or more likely the internal Number One, refurbished.  Big mystery!

<p>

The building was amazing; as big as my Evendale shop of 1954, but with diesel
standby power in the basement instead of a technical library.  It was neither
as large nor as modern as Wenke's confection in Ludwigshafen, but then central
Paris was not as easy to manipulate as the industrial spaces of GE or BASF!

<p>

As I have reported elsewhere, there was a room with banks of line printers and
a room full of paper-handling and mailing equipment, which along with a
fantasy of reports and summaries and receipts produced 360,000 paychecks every
month.  This was almost certainly the biggest payroll operation in the galaxy,
and it was set up to run come hell or high water - including strikes by the
power or water utilities, or by the railroad itself.

<p>

As for tape drives, Phil showed me twenty-four Burroughs transports, under
Olivetti Bull maintenance.  He said the drives were slow, and that fewer and
more reliable ones would be welcome, assuming they ran faster than the
Burroughses.  I gathered that these were rated at 20,000 characters [bytes,
today] per second.  The 606s were only being offered initially at 30,000 but I
told Phil I expected much closer spacing than the current 200 bpi in the next
few months.

<p>

He pressed me for details, and I admitted I was going on what I knew about IBM
tape technology, which even three years ago when I was Wild Ducked was easily
doing 600 bpi - and this was long before the Hypertape offerings to Los Alamos
and Livermore.  It was clear that the present 606 performance was not useful
to the CFF installation, and I so reported to Minneapolis.

<p>

One curious question was about rewind speed, which seemed unimportant to me in
a multi-multi-drive installation.  I was able to tell him 225 ips, which also
did not impress him, especially when I agreed that tape speeds were harder to
improve than record spacing.

<p>

He asked if IBM would license its technology, pointing out that CDC had no
track record yet in R&amp;D.  Not a chance, I told him.  We [Bull] can't buy from
them, he replied.  How about CFF?  I asked.  No answer.

<p>

This was a Friday, and the weekend exodus was jamming the ?toile and
getting worse by the minute.  The Citroen was nice to sit in, but ...  I
volunteered to walk back to the Lotti, but Phil wouldn't hear of it.  I knew
him well enough to ask him what his weekend plans were, and he said he and his
wife were staying in town, looking smugly at the confusion around us.

<p>

I have no record of that evening, nor memory either.  Low life, I'd guess, and
a croque-monsieur and a beer .  The next morning my bill for three nights in a
modest room, and continental breakfasts, and telephone, and ten francs for
Josef, was less than a hundred dollars; today, six or seven hundred.  ?a!

<hr>
<p>

I had looked forward for some years - long before the Control Data involvement
- to penetrating the mysteries of Siemens.  I had helped Heinz Gumin, and he
had risen in the company, and in 1962 was the key management figure in the
2002 enterprise as well as in the supporting design and software efforts.  He
responded briefly but pleasantly to my occasional letters, but somehow I never
felt anybody in the giant outfit was watching the American scene very closely.

<p>

This was at least partly due to the chasm between the universities and
research institutes, which were part of the world computer user community, and
the industrial powers like Siemens and Daimler Benz and BASF.  The latter were
world players in their own markets, from Sydney to Reykjavik, and knew a great
deal about their U.S. competition, but the criss-crossing between say Dupont
and Douglas was unheard of, the tremendous involvement in defense was lacking,
and the migration of researchers (and computer experts) back and forth between
Academe and business was, as I've said earlier, unheard of.

<p>

Moreover, because IBM Deutschland was a major player in IBM World Trade, it
tended to not pass as much information from White Plains and Poughkeepsie -
and nothing about SAGE or SDC or the Pentagon - to its German customers, as a
minor outfit like IBM Greece needed to do.  So the German user community knew
about IBM successes in Germany, but not much about what was going on in Santa
Monica.

<p>

In fact, Siemens customers that I had met earlier in the year seemed as
puzzled by what the 2002 people were doing as DATAMATION was.  IBM Deutschland
funneled more information about Siemens back to Paris and White Plains and 590
than any customer of either supplier ever heard, but I had no hope of
accessing that.

<p>

So I approached my first visit with strong doubts.  I had arranged to meet
only engineers, but I had used Gumin's office to set things up, hoping that
Heinz would invite me to meet with him.  Not a chance.

<p>

I flew in to Munich Sunday night [20 May] and put up at the Bayerischer Hof.
The Simca was parked forlornly at the Monte-Carlo apartment; the giddy days of
taking it with me on trains or of putting the Ivory Lady on an airplane were
suspended.  I taxied out to the huge main offices of Siemens &amp; Halske AG on
Hofmannstrasse and started in.

<p>

My date was with the chief engineer of the computer department, a vigorous
blond named Lockemann, who had brought in the tape specialist, Georg
Helmerich.  They were cool, which I soon found out was because they had just
finalized some major peripherals commitments and found a new possibility
aggravating.  I told the story colloquially in my report that night:

<p>
<blockquote>

Well, I finally penetrated!  This is the last major computer mfg. I have
contacted, unless Facit counts as major.  They were pleasant, rearranged
several schedules to see me - but showed me no labs, no equipment, no
follow-on plans; that's Siemens!  As for the present assignment, they have
just adopted the TM-2 as an alternative to IBM 727; they are staying 7-track
IBM compatible.  They do not want to commit personnel to further transport
tests and integration redesign.  Most of all, they would want CDC to establish
a base in Europe, such as Ampex has in Switzerland, and parade German-speaking
engineers before their very eyes, before placing a substantial order.  Of
course they realize your problems in doing this; that would be their position,
however, even if they were looking for a supplier.  My own guess is that they
will be a good deal more flexible after they begin to have TM-2 trouble.
Still, they have a point - because of their admitted inexperience they have
required Ampex to offer standby "exceptional" maintenance over and above that
of Siemens maintenance, on future installations.  That sounds like they had
trouble with IBM!

<p>
</blockquote>

I said they did not want a visit, but "will see you in August at IFIP".  I
estimated probability of a 606 order as 0.1, based on the possibility of poor
results from the Swiss Ampex connection.

<p>

It was a very unsuccessful first contact.  I lunched at the hotel.

<p>

It was just as well I had the afternoon free.  I had intended all along to go
to Telefunken by train, and on to other appointments, but even with the help
of the BHof staff it was not simple.  I had to coordinate train and ferry
(across Lake Constance); the concierge would get the tickets, but expected me
to know more about alternatives than I did.  I always travelled with the
Thomas Cook European timetable compilation, and it seemed to recommend going
to Zurich and doubling back.

<p>

Anyhow, relying on the concierge got me a reservation at a wonderful hotel
called the Insel, a converted cloister, so arriving, not getting there, was
half the fun!  And my expense account says I went on the town that night.

<p>

Everyone from Les Fox to the tape boys at Siemens agreed that Telefunken was
in over its head.  The TR4 was a terrific machine on paper; easily a match for
the Kidsgrove KDF9.  But would it deliver?  And for all but the most recondite
number crunching, good tapes were a necessity; the IBM experience, sweeping
away the competitors to the 700s and the 7000s partly because of superior
peripherals, confirmed it.

<p>

Telefunken GmbH was on B?cklestrasse in Konstanz, and seemed to be mostly
an engineering lab.  It was part of the Technisches Magnetophon division, one
of the smaller parts of the giant company.  I was met by the chief of
development, W. Madee, the tape transport expert W. Grimm, and a Dr. Zscherre,
all of whom were anxious to talk futures - unlike the Siemens men.

<p>

They startled me when, on a brief tour, they showed me a big area that was
intended for TR4 test when production was "moved from Backnung".  My report
tells my reaction:

<p>
<blockquote>

.... they are deeply involved with their own drive, with Ampex FR300 as a
stop-gap.  Many questions also about Potter hi-density unit.  Their own
machine is about as far along as the 606 - I saw five in the test area.  It is
? inch tape but 8 tracks; IBM-compatible reels and hubs; vacuum channels
but magnetic clutch rather than pneumatic emphasis.  My amateur opinion is
that it is a pretty complex mechanical design and not nearly as nice as yours.
However - - - it's theirs, huh?  So nothing for a while at least.  I tried
hard to leave a good impression for you in case they get in trouble in a year
or so.

<p>

The TR4 is not yet working except in the Backnung labs.  The production (??)
will be moved to Konstanz shortly - I was shown the test area.  That should
set 'em back another six months.  Looks like your competition is IBM,
Ferranti, English Electric, period!

<p>

Getting back to tapes, Grimm wants to avoid faster tapes and just go to higher
densities - probably a sign of design limitations, but who doesn't have
trouble?

</blockquote>
<p>

I put the probability of business at less than 0.1 and without putting it on
paper was sad for the TR4 and its proponents.  I could see the same
big-company problems in Siemens and Telefunken - yes, and English Electric -
that had made the GE entry so clumsy.

<p>

They were nicer than Siemens: took me to lunch, and dropped me off at the
Insel afterwards.

<p>

Konstanz is a southern satellite of Stuttgart, with frequent train service.
The Munich concierge had gotten me tickets, much easier than getting to
Konstanz in the first place, and reserved me at the Graf Zeppelin.  I had not
asked his help on the leg beyond, since the desk at the Stuttgart hotel was
presumably also competent.

<p>

My call was of course at SEL, Standard Electrik Lorenz - the third time I had
been there.  The plant was unchanged, but the brochures now said
"Informatikwerk, Stuttgart".  I talked to a marketing man named Weyersberg,
who had heard of my second visit, and a young peripherals engineer named
Polakowski.

<p>

The latter had just gotten his hands on a Stantec Zebra, which had been sent
from Britain to the Hannover Fair.  Since neither the parent organization or
its builders in the west of England were interested in building more, SEL had
managed to snaffle it easily.

<p>

As I expected, the Air France one-off system had still not been shipped.  I
poked carefully at the marketing people to find out whether they knew about
SABRE, which of course was to run on standard equipment (if you considered Rey
Johnson's disc drives to be standard!).  My recollections are negative, and
certainly there is nothing in my reports.  I saw copies of DATAMATION in two
offices, and was criticized for my "Monster Marketing" article; the Stuttgart
men were not as uninterested in the American scene as those in Munich and
Konstanz.

<p>

The Creed paper tape drives were still attached to the Air France system, but
SEL was making its own drums and mag tape transports, apparently getting a few
parts from other ITT plants.  Nothing like I had proposed to Marc
[deFerranti], of course.

<p>

The tapes were one-inch and they were using a scramble bin, I reported.

<p>
<blockquote>

.... they claim it runs 35000 cps.  My guess is either 35000 bits per second
or at most two characters wide, or 17500 frames per second.  Looks very poor -
perhaps Creed mechanism and their magnetics?  Quality also indicated by
considerable knowledge and interest in FR400.  And they use Shepard printers.

<p>

This place smells of defeat to me.  The ER56 never ran well; the reservation
systems are late; unlike Stantec they do not talk much about advanced
switching computers.  Still, if they do go that way, they will need better
tapes than their own.  And they are very pleasant to talk to - very
knowledgeable.  They are dubious about the Telefunken prospects.

</blockquote>
<p>

After lunch I went to the main station and struggled with tickets myself, more
for practice in language and customs than to avoid concierge tips.  The mark
was about 43 cents, and my expense account shows DM26,00, which I take to be
second class to Bad Hersfeld and on to Frankfurt - a third of what it would be
today.

<p>

Neither my 1998 memory nor the current Michelin helps me with the Bad Hersfeld
hotel.  It cost more than the Graf Zeppelin but less than the Insel, so it
must have been a nice place - and I stayed two nights.

<p>

This was my very first contact with Zuse people.  I had been delighted with
the wood-cabinet relay machine outside Vienna, but the men I met there were
optickers, not Zuse employees.  So here I was in what turned out to be a
substantial factory, with three or four hundred employees, and a considerable
engineering component.

<p>

My host was the chief of systems development, Ing. H.F. Heins.  He didn't know
me from Adam, but knew a lot about IBM Deutschland, a little about IBM White
Plains, and was delighted to find I had been a close friend of John Lentz, the
father of the IBM small-scientific machines which were the closest thing to
the Zuse Z22 tube machines and almost as early as the Zuse post-war equipment.

<p>

The first thing Heins did was to show me the prototype [or a very early] Z23,
which was pretty much a transistorized Z22 with up to 4000 words of core but
no mag tapes as yet.

<p>

There were pieces of a smaller and newer transistor machine, to be called the
Z31, and it was to have two FR400 tapes, which were already im haus and
checked out.

<p>

The proprietor and pioneering figure who loomed everywhere in the company and
in the national picture was alas! on an extended vacation, Heins said,
promising to show all the brochures and Control Data material to the Great
Man.  It was my first real chance to meet him, and I was very disappointed (it
was over twenty years before I finally did so).

<p>

This was what Siemens and Telefunken and SEL - yes, and English Electric and
EMI - sorely lacked: a towering figure to give not only direction and drive,
but to make the technical people and the salesmen proud.  I knew the Watsons,
and Ken Olsen and Bill Norris, and I thought also of the first Olivetti and
the first Ferranti.  And outside computing I had known Gerry Neumann and the
Three Vons.  Zuse, on a smaller stage perhaps, was just such a giant.  I had
guessed already that Gene Amdahl would be such a figure, and I had heard of
Dr. Ikeda, who was building Fujitsu.

<p>

How I regret that Niels Bech, who could have powered a much larger
Scandinavian enterprise, had died in the Seventies.  But Konrad Zuse, tough as
an oak tree, lasted into the PC era, sold his company to Siemens - which ate
it up - and died only a year or so ago, full of honors.  I wish I could have
met him in 1962!

<p>

Well, Heins took me off to a country inn mit eigene metzgerei [attached
butcher shop] and fed me a memorable lunch.  We became friends, although he
was reserved about company matters.  For instance, having been unable to see
back at the assembly area, I asked him whether the FR400s were half-inch or
one-inch.  "That also was decided by Dr. Zuse," he said.  Yes!

<p>

Next morning early I took off for Frankfurt Airport, which had even in those
days its own railroad station, and boarded a Lufthansa Convair for Amsterdam.
I took a canal boat to the Apollo, and settled in with a sigh for a
well-deserved weekend.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

I had an important Control Data prospect to call on: N.V. Electrologica.  But
after that Friday call, there remained an exciting personal affair to be
consummated.  I will return to it below.

<p>

Electrologica had been spun off some years back by the Mathematisch Centrum,
although my old friend van Wijngaarden was still involved in some subterranean
fashion.  It was established alongside a canal in central Amsterdam [Willem
Fenengastraat 31].  The director was Bram Loopstra, who had visited me in
Phoenix five years before and marvelled at the spurious cowboy ambiance and
the poor wine list of the best restaurant in 1957 Scottsdale.

<p>

He had seen the small announcement of Tom Kamp's tape drive in COMPUTERS &amp;
AUTOMATION the year before, and remembered the specs, but was unhappy when I
told him the price.  Less than IBM, I pointed out.

<p>

My report of the contact said in part:

<p>
<blockquote>

His machine [the X 1] uses Bull punched card readers and punches, and 300 lpm
printer.  He has his own paper tape reader, 1000 cps and stops between
holes(!).  Most of his (small - perhaps 30/year) production does not have
mag. tape.  The ones I did see were an old English design.  He must be the
only Continental user!

<p>

Loopstra agrees IBM compatibility is important, but mostly for larger
machines.  His prospects usually have no old tape, or tape coming from remote
subsidiary installations.  He says he simply can't afford units in the $20,000
range - two or three would cost as much as his basic machine!  This will be
the story at Regnecentralen also, of course.  But he does want to see the
exhibit at Munich.

</blockquote>
<p>

We discussed the engineering consultant prospects on the Continent and in the
British Isles.  He had already heard of my visit to the X 1 installation in
Dortmund, and we were both unhappy about the demise of van der Poel's Zebra.
I avoided talking much about Denmark and the Regnecentralen GIER.

<p>

It was clear that Electrologica would not buy 606s, and I so reported.  In my
trip-end letter later I brought up the possibility of a deal with Bech, but
did not mention the Dutch equivalent; speaks to my evaluation of the two men,
each of whom I liked very much - Loopstra the engineer, Bech the entrepreneur.

<p>

My expense accounts show I was taken to dinner, but I was so caught up in the
affair of the new super car (which I must have described ad nauseum) that I
haven't the faintest recollection of where we went or what I ate!

<p>

I had wistfully remembered the powerful and beautiful automobiles I had driven
- the Roadmaster, the New Yorker, the Silver Lady (which Loopstra had admired
in Arizona), the scarlet Alfa Veloce - as I puttered along the autostrada and
the autobahn at a hundred kilometers an hour in the little blue Simca.  I had
found a purchaser for Ranch, hoping that the faithful wagon would be as
appreciated by its second owner as it deserved.  And I had done the New York
deposit and final payment on another scarlet dream car.

<p>

This was the brand new six cylinder Alfa Romeo 2600, with a limited-edition
custom convertible body by Touring, which along with Pinin-Farina and Zagato
was energizing the rather stodgy Alfa sedans.  The new engine was an enlarged
and modernized version of the one in my Veloce; same aluminum block, same
overhead cams (and alas! same crummy electrical system).

<p>

Auto Europe had been replaced by Shipside, which based near the Amsterdam
airport and offered eager American customers substantial discounts at their
Schiphol showroom.  Delivery had been arranged for Saturday the 26th, since
the check had cleared back in Manhattan and the Dutch banks, which were of
course closed, were not involved .

<p>

The body paint was the familiar Italian racing red, the interior was a curious
dark gray artificial leather, and the top was black.  I was entranced; could
not wait to put some mileage - ah, kilometrage - on it so that I could then
open it up on the roads of Northern Italy.

<p>

Parenthetically, 200 kph was easily attainable: 125 mph.  And when I saw
headlights blinking in the rear view mirror, I would give way to Ferraris and
Maseratis doing 240!!  Those were the days!

<p>

I drove the beautiful creature carefully south that afternoon and through a
long Sunday, and Monday morning parked it at the Nice airport and flew off
early to Stockholm.

I assumed that the Swedish experience as vigorous and rather sophisticated
users which I had witnessed earlier was not going to inject them into the
world computer manufacturing orbit, but there remained two things that might
make them attractive to both the parent Control Data and to the CDC
peripherals people.  One was that SAAB might keep a position in an engineering
niche market in somewhat the same fashion that Elliott's looked to do in
Britain, or SEL claimed it wanted to do in specialized airline systems.

<p>

Such systems needed tapes, although not as many per installation as data
processing, and because the full entry was delayed in the SAAB case by
reluctance to abandon the general-purpose market, there was time for CDC to
develop niche tape hardware or learn to market the 606 family more broadly.

<p>

The second possibility was that Bech and his vision might pull the rest of
Scandinavia along, and create a viable capability for the whole region.  There
too there was time for Norris and Kamp to get acquainted with the Danish
wunderkind, and sell him a few drives and one or two 1604-sized computers
while learning his style and even helping him broaden out.  Looking back, I
see now that Bech was well ahead of most of the CDC executives, dreaming of
Eastern Europe and chemical industry applications in the same way that the
brighter IBM World Trade boys in Paris were doing.

<p>

Norris himself was a visionary, but on the American scene.  He came to pioneer
in farming applications, as one unusual example, when even the Golden Boys
around Tom Junior had not seen them.  And of course there was PLATO, which had
worldwide potential but which originated in Illinois!  But putting him
together with Bech in 1962 or 1963 looked difficult, and not just because he
didn't do foreign travel.

<p>

My appointment on the 28th was with Facit out in Solna, and the taxi out and
back cost a small fortune.  I had arranged by cable to see one O. Karlquist,
who had been mentioned in Gothenburg in February as the head of the Computer
Department.  He surprised me by bringing in his marketing man, ?ke
Wannenberg, rather than an engineer.  He had gauged the Facit interest
correctly, however, because he was upset that he and the marketing crew had
just lost a major order to IBM Sweden, and was sensitive to the compatibility
requirement.  My standard inquiry cable always mentioned that the 606 drives
were interchangeable with the IBM models.

<p>

My day report said:

<p>
<blockquote>

.... their own "Carrousel" tape drive [a weird arrangement of small spools
circling a central reading system, much less primitive than pile-up bins and
with ten times faster access - but dreadfully complicated, and ugly to look
at] costs $25,000 (Wannenberg), and Sweden is a high-cost country, hence your
$20,000 doesn't really shock 'em; also they just lost an order to the Swedish
IBM for - count 'em - twenty 1401's, for census and gov't statistical work
[the Statskontoret].  The I/O requirement was complete IBM compatibility:
cards as well as tapes.  They apparently had some trouble saying they would
meet such terms, and for this and other reasons lost out.

<p>

Their EDB is around 1401/7070 interface capability [I no longer remember why I
used the word "interface"].  I got no hint of a follow-on machine.  And no
tour!  As bad as Siemens.  As at Telefunken I tried hard to embed you in their
consciousness, expecting they will need help soon.  Some question of a
licensing arrangement; I said you people would have to be contacted for that -
I was not authorized.

</blockquote>
<p>

In my summary at the end of the tour I mentioned that I had picked up
indications later that there would be a follow-on machine, and that it would
likely be smaller.  Not only did this turn out to be an understatement, but
their next announcements were special-purpose machines as well, and with no
software features.  They were of course still discussing broader strategies,
as I was to find out - but not on this Solna visit!

<p>

I was free in the late morning, and went back to the austere but wonderful
Grand for lunch.  It was to be very different in 1974, when IFIP had a
terrific meeting centering there socially, and the freedoms of the intervening
twelve years - and a tripling of Stockholm prices - made the hotel a much much
more exciting place.

<p>

I regretfully paid my bill next morning and took the early train to
Link?ping and SAAB.  This was a very different and more pleasant feeling:
B?rje Langefors was a friend, I had visited only three months before - and
the surround was fighter planes instead of cash registers!

<p>

He introduced two policy-level people named Pedersen and Knudsen, the latter
just back from the U.S.  and full of gossip I had not yet read in DATAMATION.
The three of them broke me all up with a major disclosure, important for my
client and for Europe.  I was excited, as quoting will demonstrate:

<p>
<blockquote>

Extremely interesting news: these people are going in with Facit and a new
Danish outfit "DEF" or "DES" to form a Scandinavian computer combine modelled
after the SAS airline success!!  This has not yet been announced widely but is
not confidential.  SAAB will be the big-machine specialist with the D-21,
Facit will make I/O, especially paper tape, cards, and Carrousel (instead of
disc random-access).  DEF will make small machines.  No certainty about tape
drives - D-21 has Potter 906II as you know from my earlier visit.  Facit was
most noncommital yesterday and now I see why - but my estimate of later
interest was certainly accurate!  Pedersen says "no comittments [sic] yet
beyond the Potter drives" which sounds like none to Facit, hence no Facit
drive in the labs??  Wish I had known this yesterday!

<p>

     SAAB has sent first D-21 to its Stockholm office for display but without
fanfare.  I still doubt their marketing and support understanding, at least
topside.  To buck IBM from a like-Autonetics base is mighty complicated.  But
at least they are already major users of equipment and recognize the value of
IBM compatibility.

</blockquote>
<p>

I said at the bottom of the page that I had promised to route the CDCers
through SAAB Stockholm when they came over for IFIP Munich, and called on
Minneapolis to start planning the trip immediately [underlined on the report
sheet].  They didn't.

<p>

I made only small attempts to bring Bech, who would obviously be furnishing
GIER to the new Danish enterprise (and I suspected was the new Danish
enterprise), into the discussion.  I was to see him in a couple of days, and I
knew he would want me to spread whatever word he was generating, as well as
continue to be a conduit to Norris and Control Data.  Also I wanted to milk as
much out of Link?ping as I could while I was on the ground, rather than
waste time talking about Bech and his young men.

<p>

In spite of the excitement I checked out and got back to the station in time
for the express to Malm?, which is just across the strait from Copenhagen.
I remember a very unusual hotel called the Tunnel, and a rather vigorous night
on the town, but the details are masked by my interest in what I had begun to
call in my own mind (and later in CDC correspondence and in DATAMATION) the
SCC, Scandinavian Computer Combine.

<p>

Next morning I went to AB. [Aktiebolaget] ADDO, another business machines
company less well known in the States than Facit but a strong competitor in
those day in Europe.  It was not a good visit.

<p>

My host was a very pleasant man named W. Wang-Andr?sen, director of Special
Products Sales.  He explained that after the death of Axel Wenner-Gren the
flow of "big electronics" [his expression] from the ALWAC people in the
U.S. had dried up, and the company had decided to pull back to paper tape and
key-driven gear.

<p>

I suggested there might be a market for conversion equipment such as
paper-tape-to-mag-tape, pointing out that such machinery sold well in
aerospace for instance, and was too expensive - and made by too-
unknowledgeable California outfits - to be offered in Europe.  It cheered him
up a little, but not much.

<p>

I reported to Norris that he then told me they had just sold "SKr 2,000,000
($400,000) worth of paper tape stuff" to the Swedish post office,
demonstrating that this was big business if not big electronics!

<p>

I added that "unless they have some computer-electronics people still on board
with little to do" this idea would go nowhere.  In my big report on European
users I had explained that one of the dozens of differences between Europe and
the U.S. was that technical men and women did not move from company to company
on the Continent, as they did so freely in California.  And ADDO would be hard
put to discharge them.  The idea was not easy for Minneapolis types.

<p>

The hall porter at the Tunnel had coached me on taking and enjoying the ferry
to Copenhagen, which ran several times a day as well as carrying sleeping cars
on the wonderful night run.  There were tax-free advantages, and in those days
travelers from the U.S. were dazzled by ?alborg aquavit for well under two
dollars.  But I was flying out of Kastrup immediately, and Niels Bech was the
sort of man to whom you might present a really old bottle of Armagnac from
Fauchon's, but not primitive booze.  So I refrained.

<p>

I had a wonderful session with him.  He was anxious to talk, more because of
his excitement than because of my DATAMATION window, and not at all because of
Control Data.  I could see that the new SCC would not get advanced peripherals
from Facit, and was fairly blunt in saying so.  And clearly they would not
dream of getting anything from IBM, even if made in Europe.

<p>

So I was pleased for Norris and Kamp.  I reported:

<p>
<blockquote>

.... the DEIF outfit is a Copenhagen mfg. firm that will make Bech's GIER!
And Bech expects to be about 1/3 of the joint R/D enterprise in this new
Scandinavian combine.  He says they have to have "IBM" as well as Facit and
Facit Carrousel drives.  Specifically, he is interested in but not committed
to Ampex, and would like to play with your 606 first.  He wants 3 things:

<p>
<ol>

<li>You should visit his people, esp. Petersen, before Munich.

<li>The Munich display machine should come to him afterwards, at $825/mo
rental, for 4-5 months evaluation.

<li>He would want a guarantee (letter-of-intent basis, called a "pre-order"
here) of at least 4, perhaps 8-10, 50~ drives beginning in October if the
evaluation is satisfactory.

</ol>
<p>

He would put at least some (4?) of these on a built-up GIER that he is using
for demonstration and R/D.  But of course the major chance is to be the sole
supplier of drives to the Scandinavian combine.  Quick, men, to horse!  To
horse!

</blockquote>
<p>

I pointed out that Bech would be the program chairman of the whole IFIP Munich
event, and that as much discussion and technical exchange as possible should
be scheduled in advance or with this in mind.  I requested of Kamp himself
that he send a team "here and to ICT and Bull", by mid-June (the Munich social
events and registration began Sunday 26 August).

<p>

Parenthetically, my visits to Minneapolis in June didn't do much to speed up
the machinery.  One major problem was that the engineers and management people
had never been to Europe, had no passports or vaccinations, had family
problems that were encountered and managed four decades ago in IBM, and even
further back in National Cash, but were brand new to Control Data.

<p>

The machinery that shipped Don Pendery smoothly from California to World Trade
Paris was necessary for The Old Man's vision of World Peace - and of
international sales.  Control Data had a junior version in place by the
mid-Seventies, but in 1962 ...

<p>

Also they needed a great deal of financial and legal help once they began.
ICT was armed; Bull was armed, and could and would retreat behind the language
barrier; Bech and his Danish partners were more at home in Warsaw than Norris
and Kamp and Miles were in, say, Ottawa.

<p>

Yes, the Minneapolis banks had affiliates in London and in Paris and,
unfortunately as it turned out later, in Frankfurt.  Yes, American Express and
local travel agents could help.  But this was Year One for CDC.

<p>

But this was a little in the future.  Here in lovely Copenhagen, with Tivoli
open and Bech being his formidably hospitable self, the world of European
computing looked wide open.  I flew back to Nice that night delighted with my
two expeditions.

<p>

Friday morning in Monte-Carlo I aired out my hardly-used studio, deplored the
stale coffee beans and the lack of coffee cream, went gaily off to pay two
months rent at the real estate agency - and reality intruded.  Elizabeth
cabled that our much-loved D?odat was in trouble, and needed me.

<p>

So where I had been planning a leisurely week writing up my tour report and
finding a typist - I had been too busy to find one, in six months - I had to
rush down to the travel office and buy a ticket.

<p>

And talk about the novices in Minneapolis - my own smallpox vaccination had
expired!  My expenses record says 23.30 francs.  And I had almost nothing for
my expectant wife, except what I could pick up quickly at Orly.

<p>

I mixed frequent trips to the vet with drafting my tape report - and getting
deliciously reacquainted with Elizabeth.  We worked together on ideas about
how she and Grace, and our Little Boy, might move to Europe if the "business"
flourished.  I already had ideas of what I might do for other clients, and
indeed cemented relations during this stay in Manhattan with an interesting
security analyst named Richard E.  Jennison, who wanted to find out about
current and near-future EDP overseas.

<p>

He was a senior figure in Auerbach [no relation!], Pollak &amp; Richardson: not
yet as I remember a partner, but head of the institutional research
department.  (The firm still exists, and still uses the brokerage code AUER.)
He had an attractive sidekick named Peggy Schulder, and the two of them
sampled my wares at delightful and ferociously expensive dinners at Chambord.

<p>

Soon Dick signed me up as an information resource.  I recycled the impressions
I had brought with me from the ITT adventure and had acquired in huge measure
on the two CDC tours.  He was not then interested in Japan or Australia, but
noted that I had experiences there that might be, um, purchasable in a couple
of years.

<p>

They were very straight with me; did not attempt to winkle out free advice or
information as for instance Fletcher Jones had a couple of years back when
Computer Sciences was a pup.  I was careful not to disclose Control Data plans
at that time, although later in the year I was frank about the ungainly
tactics of the European advent.

<p>

I had been careful to avoid any mention of exclusivity in my two contracts
with Minneapolis; whether they didn't think of requiring it - my theory, since
they certainly should have restricted my future disclosure of their plans, and
did not do so - or simply thought of the information as ephemeral, I never
knew.  At any rate, I summarized my user-tour experiences and most of the
things I had seen on my tour of manufacturers with a clear conscience.

<p>

This was made easy by their use of tape recordings rather than requiring
hundreds of pages of manuscript.  The observations I had made in the
Hundred-Page Letter were so mingled with material about CDC prospects that I
couldn't give Dick a copy, but I drew on them heavily as I recalled SEL and
Regnecentralen, and of course IBM Europe.

<p>

The two put out an excellent 35-page hardcover report for their clients,
"Outlook for Foreign Electronic Data Processing", dated November 10, 1962.
They had made visits themselves by then, and I found new information for my
own databank in my copy, but a great deal was based on my observations.

<p>

What they had been able to do, because they were security analysts rather than
consultants, was to ask IBM and other organizations - probably back in New
York - for figures on sales that I would not have dared to request.  These
figures they incorporated in small tables which were an important part of the
early pages of their document.

<p>

For instance they gave estimated value for 1962 foreign computer sales by
company:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
IBM .................... $ 650 million
Univac (Sperry Rand) ...... 65
Machines Bull ............. 60
ICT ....................... 55
Ferranti .................. 33
Elliott ................... 28
NCR ....................... 23
Siemens &amp; Halske .......... 22
Olivetti .................. 20
English Electric .......... 18
Others .................... 26

TOTAL .................. $1000 million
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

My feelings when I first saw these tabulations were mixed; on the one hand,
they were using what the salesmen and analyst-feeders were tossing them; on
the other hand, the numbers looked pretty good - and it was the only game in
town!  It was also noteworthy that IBM in those days tried not to give dollar
figures except in the annual report, and even there aggregated and massaged
wherever they could.  A whole industry grew up around the construction of such
estimates; numbers of machines sold were compiled from the trade press and
press releases, customers helped produce typical cost figures.  But that was
in the future; men like Jennison and Calhoun (who had written the earlier
document SRI had originated) were pioneers of their kind.

<p>

I made two trips to Minneapolis in June: the 11th and the 28th.  They were
excruciating.  I saw hardly anything of Norris, and not much of Kamp, who
seemed not to have digested my day reports or even to have read the overall
one.

<p>

Miles introduced me to the new player in the game, uncaringly destroying my
hopes of a full-time Control Data job.  This was Edward E. Strickland, at the
time treasurer of the corporation.  He had come to CDC when Norris acquired
Cedar Engineering locally as part of a wild expansion which included an
exchange of stock in Scientific Computers, Inc. and a joint venture with
Holley Carbureter which did not prosper.

<p>

Norris was busy finalizing the 1962 Annual Report, which also referred to an
affiliation in Australia and the creation of a wholly-owned subsidiary in
Canada.  Dated August 13 [1962] it referred in one sentence to the European
decision which had been taken in July; "Another wholly-owned subsidiary of
Control Data has been established in Western Europe and marketing activities
will commence in early fall."  I had asked him point-blank to use me in all
these efforts, and he had turned me down on the first two and disclosed
Strickland's existence with reference to the last.

<p>

I was paid promptly for my two tours, the last invoice having been submitted
on June 16th.  The totals were $10,800 in fees and $3,953 in expense.  But
when I tried to get Strickland to involve me in the next stage, which in my
presentations was to make a big appearance at IFIP Munich, I found that he and
Miles were absorbed in starting a European operation, and did not want to wait
and talk to Bech and others first.  And on the second visit they told me they
had hired a marketing manager, one Peter Stevens, then based near Frankfurt,
who had a background in business data processing sales but none at all in
scientific and technical matters.

<p>

Never figured out to this day how these things were done.  I was their
consultant.  I was the only person in the whole cabal that had any first-hand
knowledge of Australia or of Western Europe, and I had a lot of knowledge of
Canada and an entree at Toronto, where they were going to base.  I was a major
figure in the worldwide user community, and in the American one before that.
And I genuinely wished them well.

<p>

There were of course other players.  All five vice presidents knew me: Frank
Mullaney, Bill Keye, Hank Forrest, and of course Miles and Cray.  And there
was the First National Bank of Minneapolis, and Peat Marwick Mitchell, and a
big local law firm, who didn't.

<p>

It was a small board of directors, with four insiders and three money guys.
That shouldn't have been a problem.  The biography of Norris by Jim Worthy is
hearsay about these times, and mostly repeats Norris' anecdotes.  There were
stories in DATAMATION and the Wall Street Journal, but they are inconclusive:
tend to focus on the Sperry Rand suit, which had been settled in January.

<p>

On the second trip I found out that Strickland and Miles were planning to talk
to a London bank and make a decision about a Swiss location in July.  Neither
of them wanted me around, but I succeeded in forcing my way in by a tactic
which both men seemed to value: I cut my fee!

<p>

I wanted to influence them, and I wanted to steer them around IFIP and
introduce them to Bech and others.  And I did help, in the end, but not with
the short-term matters.  In a letter to their general counsel (of Oppenheimer,
Hodgson, Brown, Baer and Wolff) I gave an informal review of the deal:

<p>
<blockquote>

Strickland and I accordingly worked out the following extension of the
relationship, which was then rehearsed with Norris (and later with Miles) in
lieu of reduction to writing: for the months July through September I was to
assist Strickland and Miles in Europe; while they were doing legal/financial
things my daily fee was to be reduced from the usual $200 to $100; the minimum
fee for the period was to be $6000; expenses were to be as before (see written
agreements).  None of this is in dispute, I believe.  It was understood that a
major part of my task was to be attendance at the international Munich
computer meeting and show in early September (this part at full fee).  I was
to assist in recruiting, introduce them to customers I had previously
solicited [without having disclosed the CDC sponsorship, that is], and so on.

</blockquote>
<p>

I flew to Amsterdam July 9/10 on my last propeller crossing, a KLM DC7-C.
Strickland and Miles had settled at the American Hotel in Leidseplein, a very
poor choice; I seem to remember Peter Stevens showed up, but was staying
somewhere better.  I would have put them at the Europe, and my obvious
disapproval and their own observations (neither knew anything at all then
about European travel) at least got them to switch reservations to top hotels
later.

<p>

I had wanted them to meet the Shell people on behalf of Surly Seymour, or
Loopstra of Electrologica for Tom Kamp, but they spent Monday the 9th at some
bank or other, and apparently were told not to come to the Netherlands; in
fact, even in 1964 when they had begun a major expansion in Europe, they put
only a minor office in Amsterdam.  By the time I arrived they were packing up
for London, where they had a date in the City with the Toronto &amp;Dominion
Bank - not exactly a major factor in Threadneedle Street, but apparently an
affiliate of First National.  I switched my air travel to join theirs, flying
backward [my log says for the first time] on a BE Vanguard.  The bank sprang
for a very nice luncheon near the Royal Exchange, and I liked the people, but
had wistful thoughts about the coming affair at ICT.

<p>

I had barely had time to set up a meeting at ICT, but they produced several
engineering executives, and Strickland and I were able to extend my rather
vague offers of test 606 tape drives, and discuss financial terms.  He was
unhappy back at the hotel that there had been no money man present; I, that we
had not drawn Colonel Davies.

<p>

We flew back next morning to Schiphol, on a less-interesting Viscount, and
this time had been put up at the Victoria, which wasn't much of an improvement
over the American.  Stevens had not tried to switch them to his hotel, but
spent a long evening with us talking about the Swiss visit.  He was not keen
on either the Netherlands or Switzerland; wanted them to base in or near
Frankfurt.

<p>

I kept trying to recall to them that their customers were scientists and
engineers, who would like Amsterdam or Geneva, and in Germany would dislike
Frankfurt and much prefer Munich.  They all three thought I was strange, and
it was during the contrasting of the two German cities that I realized nether
Strickland nor Stevens had any feeling for technical computing (Miles of
course had AEC and university prospects, and had old ERA installations in mind
also).

<p>

We flew the next morning to Zurich, and settled at the Carlton Elite, which
was at the same part of the hotel spectrum as the Dutch hotels, but much
better in absolute measure.  It is in the heart of downtown, and we did local
travel by train, being only two blocks from the main station.  But next time
the entourage came to Switzerland they went to the Dolder; they were learning!

<p>

They met with two young salesmen, currently working at the local IBM office on
a bid for a major machine at the ETH [Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule],
the MIT-type polytechnic, which was home to Eduard Stiefel and Heinz
Rutishauser and would have been my third call in Switzerland in March if
Mother's death had not intervened.  They were senior figures in the world
academic computer community, Stiefel heavily on the numerical analysis side,
Rutishauser more into programming.  I had met them several times, first at the
Watson Lab, and had had Rutishauser in Phoenix when he was on his way to UCLA.

<p>

But in this chapter they are in background, although central to the proposal
effort.  The institution and its computer experts were ripe: they had had Zuse
relays, and built some vacuum tube equipment themselves: ERMETH, an offshoot
of BESK.  Now they needed a 7094, and IBM was preparing to offer a substantial
discount.  Miles set out to seduce the two youngsters, who were obviously ripe
for the plucking.  I was horrified.

<p>

After they left I expostulated.  "Jim, you just can't do this sort of thing.
This isn't California, or Pratt &amp; Whitney.  These guys ought to give IBM six
months notice, and never be allowed anywhere near any account they have
knowledge of through IBM for literally years.

<p>

"I realize you can't prosper without hiring some experienced men, and with the
languages and the sales experience, but get 'em from Univac or Burroughs; IBM
will fry you.  And this is the worst country in Europe to distort the
Establishment's pay scales.  IBM already pays those two forty percent more
than scale, and you are dangling a huge increase on top of that.

<p>

"Listen, it isn't just the competition that will complain.  The customers
themselves, the ETHs and the CERNs and the railroad, are going to be outraged
if you act like a bunch of American pirates.  They don't like that game, and
IBM avoids most of it by hiring only nationals - and gains ground against
outfits that bring in American managers."  You could see the midwestern faces
shut down.  Stevens, who certainly could verify my story, kept his eyes
lowered.  I destroyed myself in half an hour.

<p>

In the long run it didn't matter.  In less than two years the CDC machines
began arriving.  There were offices in thirteen countries.  IBM grew handily,
but from a big base; CDC sprang up overnight.  It wasn't just anti-IBM
sentiment, and it certainly wasn't any smoothing out of Control Data
crassness.  The facts were that the 1604A was good, the 3600 was very good
(although never the success it should have been), and the 6600 was a genuine
super.  The computers sold themselves, at least in a scientific environment.
Seymour Cray really was terrific, surly or no.

<p>

Next day we went off to Luzern, where we were met by a young financial man
from the Geneva branch of Peat Marwick.  He had arranged to introduce us to
the head of the Chamber of Commerce, which in most Swiss cantons is
governmental rather than non-profit private.  He was small, white-haired, with
very good English.  I was startled to have Ed tell him immediately that
Control Data had decided on the advice of its accounting firm and its bank, to
establish its European headquarters in Luzern.

<p>

When I quietly expressed my amazement to Jim that evening he frowned and said
they would have to clear it with Norris.  But that hardly registered at the
time; I had been shaken by another matter.

<p>

The Chamber director was not too surprised; there had clearly been exchanges
with Peat Marwick.  He set out to welcome us, saying that his office stood
ready to help not only in business matters but in personal ones, mentioning
schools (there was no international school, nor much expatriate presence).
Then he made a few cautionary remarks, notably saying forthrightly that any
"distortion of the labor market, and particularly of salaries" [I remember the
phrase vividly] would be unwelcome.

<p>

We said various polite things; the whole interview lasted well under an hour.
As we broke up the director, who understood that I was living in Europe, put
his arm in mine and said how pleased he was to have a computer firm come to
his city.  "My nephew works for IBM in Zurich, and is always telling me how
wonderful the machines are."

<p>

Oh!!!

<p>

Stevens opened a small office and had letterheads printed.  I suppose he did
bank accounts and such.  He hired the two IBMers.  They never moved down from
Zurich.  He never moved down from Frankfurt.  The office was closed quietly
before the end of 1962; a small sales office was opened in Zurich, and a new
headquarters location was announced in DATAMATION: Frankfurt!  And even that -
the idea of a European head office - had vanished by the time the rather nice
1964 Annual Report came out.

<p>

But that was in the future.  The next stop for the four of us (the Peat
Marwick man having dropped out) was Germany, where I was to observe
negotiations for a sales office.  I quote from the 1963 summary letter to
Counsel:

<p>
<blockquote>

We were to talk to the embassy in Bonn, then to various consulates and
chambers-of-commerce types, before reaching a decision.  Instead, they
(M&amp;S) were hell-bent for Frankfurt a/M, even though the consulate there
said bluntly it was the worst place in the country for them unless they had to
come.  I pushed very vigorously indeed - even though I was in virtual Coventry
- for a Munich location, in view of the number of technical customers there
and the far greater ease of recruiting German personnel (technical and office)
in that very pleasant area.

</blockquote>
<p>

The troop went back to Zurich, where this time we all put up luxuriously at
the Dolder Grand.  I made my last arguments, Stevens disappeared, and Miles
flew back to headquarters.

<p>

I again said I wanted to go around with Stevens when he could put on his CDC
hat, and also kept pushing for a better appearance at IFIP in September, and
for the dispatch of tape drive experts before that, but could see that I
wasn't registering.  I resolved to write Kamp directly and turned back to
Monte-Carlo on the 19th, with a heavy heart.

<p>

I considered writing also to Norris, asking that they be sure Stevens attended
the meetings in Munich, where there would be literally hundreds of his
potential customers milling around, but in the end I did not do so.  Instead I
laid out a written plan for Miles of how I would spend "his" $200 days before
and during IFIP, and adjuring him to make sure Stevens attended - and that he
came himself, of course.  I knew there was no hope of Norris!

<p>

I had a personal mishap during the next days, which even now I connect to my
finally saying goodbye to the Simca.  I turned my faithful Ranch over to the
Forum Garage in Nice on 28 July for 3700 francs [$704], almost exactly half
what I had paid eight months before.

<p>

In the next week I drove my scarlet 2600 down to Milan, exulting in how it
powered up and down the fifty lacets [hairpin turns] of the col de Tenda.  I
have faint memories of marvelling at the disarray in the banking side of
American Express, which made Nice look good and even AmEx Paris, bearable.  It
was something to do with the 3700 francs, but I no longer remember what.

<p>

I then drove gaily up into Austria, staying one night in Bregenz and two in
Salzburg.  I was delighted to find a country inn south of the latter, in
Hellbrunn, the Maria-Theresien-Schl?ssl, which would offer a handsome suite
for Elizabeth and Grace, welcome Deo - there were house pets as well as a
trout stream - and do so very inexpensively on condition that we pack away our
belongings and turn the apartment back during the summer weeks of the
Festival.  The gracious female owner charged ten times our rate for those
weeks!  Michelin tells me it is still in business: "14 rooms", and they now
have television!

<p>

Parenthetically, it never happened.  I was optimistic about my European
venture, although the CDC chapter was not prospering, and Elizabeth was eager
to come, but the Cuban crisis, my father's death soon thereafter, and probably
most of all the worry-induced decline in Aunt Grace's vigor made it
impossible.  And when Elizabeth finally visited the Schl?ssl she found it
charming but did not like Salzburg.  ?a!!

<p>

But about the mishap: I drove back toward the Riviera over the Brenner, and
came down into Verona late at night with the intention of pushing on into the
morning on the deserted roads and autostrade.  I was shouldered off the road
by a giant camion and left dazed in a ditch as the beast thundered away.  My
lovely new Alfa was badly hurt but not destroyed; it needed a great deal of
what the Brits then called "panel beating" - poor poor Ivory Lady - and a new
front bumper and grill, but the wonderful engine and the tender convertible
top were undamaged.

<p>

I was picked up by some other truckers and taken in to the city.  I called
ACI, the AAA of Italy, and they sent out a wrecker; I had only a small
suitcase with me and had pulled it out of the trunk as my rescuers watched.  I
put up at the best hotel, the Due Torri, calculating from my experiences
before and since coming to Monte-Carlo that I desperately needed a good
concierge.  This was a Sunday night, besides: 5/6 August.

<p>

Monday was beastly.  I had to taxi to the big Alfa Romeo dealership, where ACI
had deposited my wounded beauty.  Then there was a severe language problem;
Verona is not a major tourist center, and the local Alfa owners included few
or no English.  It was difficult enough that in the end most of the
negotiating was done by telephone, with the Due Torri portiere as interpreter.

<p>

There were two major items.  First, my low-deductible collision insurance was
with the Danish subsidiary of a big German firm, and had been written and paid
for in Amsterdam.  Second, the 2600 had this custom body by Touring, and parts
like the bumper and grill and left-side door handle would take months to
obtain - and no substitution was possible.

<p>

Ohhh!

<p>

The sad event did not hurt my Control Data work much, since I could fly to
customer sites and of course to IFIP.  But it cramped - in fact, destroyed -
my Monte-Carlo adventure.  I thought seriously of buying back little Ranch!

<p>

The details are no longer of interest.  Europe is a different place today, and
a problem like that would be easier for an expat (and much easier for a
tourist) to handle.  Suffice it to say that as I travelled up and down Europe
by plane and train and taxi, I had a dozen superb concierges telephone Verona
to measure progress on the repairs.

<p>

And in the end it all came out pretty well, but with elephantine slowness.  I
had to pay a huge bill in lire - over a thousand dollars - and wait several
months for reimbursement.  The net cost of the 2600 had been $3850 (that is,
not counting the $704 from the Simca), and the repairs ultimately cost me only
a $250 deductible and some incidentals.  If I could have been in Verona to
hand out encouraging 10,000-lire notes things would have gone much faster!

<p>

These memories overlay my CDC adventures of the next weeks, the weeks before
IFIP Munich.  My air logs show I stayed on the road for the rest of August,
and returned to Monaco after the big conference only to fly off again to the
British Computer Society meeting in Cardiff.  I will reserve that story, and
turn to my third, short, and rather unhappy Control Data tour.

<p>

One of the intersections of Control Data and my past experiences was the
6600/STRETCH metaphor.  Just as C-E-I-R could not envisage its own STRETCH -
nor could RAND, for that matter - so Shell was not ready for its own big 6600.
It had the problems, it had great people and lots of vision.  But where
Generous Electric had reached out for early 701s and Univacs, and the
Livermore types had begged later for huge expensive machines (citing Grosch's
Law, mirabile dictu!), no European enterprise I could help would plunk down
six or seven million hard American dollars for one of Seymour's monsters.  One
or two nuclear labs, perhaps; a STRETCH was at work in England.

<p>

But these shops tended to interact with eager Dunwells and reluctant Crays
directly.  I was convinced there was room for many more 6600s than that.  The
customers were straitlaced and CDC was unimaginative.  What next?
Cooperation!

<p>

I put down a short list of the more eager.  It ran to Atomenergi in Norway,
Shell in the Netherlands, what I called the SCC in Scandinavia, maybe EdF
later on.  And certainly BASF when Wenke had digested the first German 7094.

<p>

Unlike the proposal I worked out on Sunset Boulevard, I envisaged two or three
or four European outfits, not competitors like the tin airplane boys I had
tried to cluster for Robinson's benefit.  I hoped for Amsterdam as a location,
remembering good things not only about Shell but about the Dutch
infrastructure and the Dutch experience.  I wrote out an outline of what I
proposed and sent it off to Minneapolis.  No response.

<p>

I cabled the gist to six locations and got four invitations to come and talk
about it.  There was just time for a round before IFIP overwhelmed us.  I sent
Miles an itinerary and urged him to come over in time to check out my
progress.  No response.

<p>

I did Oslo on the 9th and 10th, going first to the Lillestr?m location.  I
had not only Jan Garwick but his boss Tor H?vie, director of the Atomenergi
computer center.  My call report, which went to the U.S., estimated 0.3
probability of a sale and said "3600 if discounted, or 1604A":

<p>
<blockquote>

It turns out these people have already requested a tender from you some weeks
ago.  They share a DEUCE now and want to step up to a 7094-class machine or
better.  Other contenders are English Electric KDF9 (leading), 1107, and (if
it exists?) Telefunken TR4.  ATLAS (and 6600) too expensive.  They can get
about N Kr 10,000,000 = $1,400,000 from their supporting agency, the ministry
covering scientific and industrial research institutes (like Regnesentral).

</blockquote>
<p>

I went on at length about a proposal, emphasizing timing and completeness, and
concluded by reporting that "local Rem Rand" was "dangling up to 50 % discount
on 1107", and how I had implied "you were giving comparable allowances to
Am. universities", which was still in the future.  The tone of the whole
report is minatory, and seen from 1998, ill-advised.

<p>

Next day I spent at Lysaker, closer in to the center.  The activities of
Regnesentral were divided between scientific and administrative directors, the
latter being a Mr. ?rjansen.  I took Kristen Nygaard to dinner at Blom's
that night and afterwards wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>

... Nygaard has over 30 O.R.people, expects to double again next year.  Needs
a 1604- or 7090-class machine (double precision nice but not used too often;
he calls 3600 double-precision too long - - 84, that is).

</blockquote>
<p>

I go on to funding sources and amounts, reprising the previous story from
Atomenergi.

<p>
<blockquote>

He has had big trip (his first) to America under Rem Rand auspices ... and as
direct result is very sold indeed on 1107 ... Needs or at least wants
DP/symbol-processing capabilities, hence 6-bit byte operations very
attractive.  IBM poor second here, EE KDF9 largely because Garwick insists is
running third.  ORION possible?

</blockquote>
<p>

There are some scribbles about 1604 "DP/OR/symbol manip appl" and the usual
adjurations to get moving.  Not one word in either report even hints at a
cooperative 6600, and I don't remember if Garwick or Nygaard were supportive.
What they wanted, and what the administrators wanted even more, was a written
and timely proposal for one or two standard machines.

<p>

I went on to Copenhagen Friday morning.

<p>

This time I stayed at the Royal, which is the SAS hotel in the very center of
things.  I liked it for its cool modernity, its handsome shops, its 20th floor
view restaurant, and its legions of SAS stewardesses in and out of uniform.  I
ate alone that night at 7 Small Homes, looking forward to a session on
Saturday with Bech.

<p>

Niels was encouraging.  The new combine was already looking at a big machine,
he said; at least a 7094 or a KDF-9.  Or a 1604, he laughed.  He thought the
Norwegians would be a pain in a cooperative because of their military
preoccupation, but he sympathized with my interest.  He too thought everything
hinged on a lead partner, and that it might well be Shell Laboratories.

<p>

Rather to my surprise, he was not forthcoming about the Combine, and I
gathered that he and the Danish commercial outfit were having problems.  I was
a big fan of SAAB, mostly not because of their D-21 but because of their CEO.
Bech agreed but said it was hard to get past their fighter plane mind set.  He
rolled his eyes when I said that military jet engine contracts had been the
life blood of my Evendale fantasia.  Not in Sweden, he said rather grimly.

<p>

The weather was gorgeous, and the tourist season was at its height.  The shops
in Str?get all closed Saturday noon anyhow, Europe being Europe, leaving
the Americans gazing sadly at the window displays of silver and porcelain and
handsome furniture.  I laughed to one couple that it was worse in Paris, where
the whole town had gone to the mountains and the beaches for a month.  They
couldn't believe me.

<p>

Sunday I took a KLM Electra to Amsterdam - one of the last I ever rode.  The
jets were overwhelming the older planes, and before their long design lives
had barely started.  I had thought the DC7-C that flew me to Bora Bora was
pretty wonderful, but when I looked out at Peary Land from a long-distance Air
France 707 later in that same trip I knew it was doomed.

<p>

Free this time from the inexperience of the CDC travel office, I put up at the
Apollo.  I had an encouraging telephone conversation with Rudy Lunbeck, who
said he was setting up a joint Shell-Philips conference in the Hague next day,
that I was reserved at the Des Indes "with the Shell discount" that night, the
14th, and that he and his group were going down right away to make sure things
were ready.  It was the high point of the third task, and I sent a
finely-scribbled call report off to Ed Strickland, who had supposedly settled
in at the Dolder Grand to get Luzern in train before going off to Munich.

<p>
<blockquote>

Shell/Philips joint<br>
meeting at Parkhotel, the Hague

<p>

prob 0.2     Large 3600 installation<br>
Chairman: Dr. R.J. Lunbeck, Shell Amsterdam

<p>

This idea stems from other Shell visits (see report).  I proposed a non-profit
Dutch corporation managed by committee representing 3-4 shareholders, one year
commitment.  Corp. would lease and operate installation, sell time to
shareholders at cost, pay CDC full rental.  But CDCwould also be shareholder,
with special unique right to resell its 1/3-1/4 share to others, at cost-plus-
sales-commission rate.  Extra-shift time available first to non-CDC
shareholders at cost, then available to CDC for resale; full extra-shift
rental paid to CDC; operational economies shared by all partners.  Preferably
shareholders non-competitors, hence BP and Texaco not approached.  Other
possibilities SHAPE, State Mines, etc.  Philips ultimately will want own-built
machine but this is attractive stop-gap.  The CDC share is at worst a
disguised discount, at best cost-free.  Conceivably deal could be such that
unused time available Lucerne outfit for training and installation free-time.
I emphasized that this was a new idea for CDC and did not have full support of
all corporate staff; that this would depend on details.  The group rejected a
6600 pitch as too much, too late, and too uncertain; [they] estimated it would
take six months to prepare and present proposal to sufficient possible
shareholders.  Group also insisted shop could not be run by CDC - - must be
completely independent with CDC having only 1/3-1/4 vote in management.
Especially concerned with scheduling and possibility of remote operation.
Location not a problem.  Cost estimated at $1000/hr by me; group felt it could
get figure down considerably by non-American management!!

<p>

DISCUSS INTERNALLY BEFORE IFIP

</blockquote>
<p>

It was a friendly group, and there were broad smiles when the remark about
non-American management was made.  I laughed and said I was interested, and
was now domiciled in Monte-Carlo.  Sounds great even now.

<p>

There was no reply from Strickland, either from Zurich or from Minneapolis.  I
sent off a handwritten note to Norris, and Miles replied on his behalf, and
incidentally gave the arrival times for the Control Data men coming to Munich:
juniors early, to set up the exhibit; seniors later.  No one of the three
evinced the slightest interest in the Shell/Philips idea.

IFIP62 was covered moderately well in DATAMATION.  It was not as joyful as its
Paris progenitor; a smaller percentage of the American contingent brought
their spouses, and if Munich is the Paris of Germany, it is not the Paris of
Paris!  And the stresses of the U.S. military presence bothered the Europeans
and the British, although the Californians hardly noticed.

<p>

After eight months on the concierge circuit I was an experienced hand at good
reservations.  Passing up the hotels recommended by the organizers, I put down
at the Bayerischer Hof again, arriving from London on the famous Pan Am 2
--yes, the same one which had introduced me to the Kai Tak landing pattern
almost 27 months before.  It was full of computer people, groggy from the long
transatlantic haul and from the indignities of Heathrow, where I had boarded.

<p>

This was Saturday 25 August.  There was an elegant late breakfast in the front
cabin, and afterwards I toured steerage and found a dozen friends.  Hal
Bergstein and his wife Jane had come straight through from Los Angeles, and
were in poor shape; Hal had just taken over the editor's chair at DATAMATION,
and was planning an informal article, with pictures.  It appeared in the
October issue, and the best of the poor photos shows the DATAMATION booth!

<p>

Most of the East Coast contingent were happy with themselves, and one or two
sophisticates had come a day or two earlier and stopped off in London to
recover their bearings.  Ike Auerbach, who was the founding IFIP president,
had come still earlier and was already in Munich.

<p>

Only a few of the North Americans had seen the article I had contributed to
the August issue, "An Intonation On Internationalism".  It called for a very
different governance of IFIP than had been put in place; the Americans (and
the Brits) didn't care, and the Europeans, who cared quite a lot, saw the
piece only if they picked up a copy at the Thompson booth.  It reads poorly
today; stuffy and prissy alternately.  Many of the ideas were good in spite of
that, but none were adopted then, and it took three decades for my
recommendation of biennial rather than triennial meetings to be accepted.

<p>

I mentioned in Chapter 40 that I had done a short column in an early issue of
the magazine, complaining about the one-country-one-vote council pattern.
What I now suggested was the formation of regional federations, which would
meet every other year and be primarily technical, and the IFIP overbody which
would meet in the interstices and be primarily ceremonial.  I argued that the
regions would be more evenly balanced in size and financial ability than the
individual countries, and mentioned the immediate need for a European region:

<p>
<blockquote>

It all sounds most complicated and artificial, doesn't it?  But look at a few
of the immediate benefits:

<p>
<ol>

<li>An urgently needed international exchange for European data-processing
communities. 

<li>A channel upward for the NMAA and for user groups in theUnited States.

<li>More frequent but less expensive international assemblies, closer to home.

<li>An overlay of the scientific union type of organization, without major
dislocation of the current arrangement.

</ol>
<p>

And in the long run, the regional federation would provide:

<p>
<ol start="5">

<li>An organization capable of handling hundreds of thousands of individual
members from fifty or sixty countries.

<li>And doing so with far less disparity of representation than the current
one-country-one-vote method.

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>

The Control Data contingent was in trouble.  The part I cared mostly for was
the provision of a tape drive expert, and that had gone ahead: an engineer
named Thorndyke.  But the CDC exhibit was built around the 606 that I had been
talking about up and down the continent, and it was seriously damaged in
shipment - and need I say there were power supply problems too!  Meanwhile the
huge IBM stand went together smoothly, ran off fifty-cycle Bavarian
electricity, and drew customers and prospects like flies.  Moreover, the
1401<br> they featured had been made in Sindelfingen!

<p>

There were by now over 150 1401s installed in Germany alone, and 300 more on
order; both figures had doubled since January.  One of the booth salesmen (the
gorgeous booth birds of AFIPS conferences were sadly lacking) told me in
German that IBM had five thousand employees at the factory, and 1700 customer
engineers at work.  Stevens would need to hustle!

<p>

I noted however that in spite of the 7090 and 7094 installations and orders,
there was no mention of big machines in the sales talk-talk, and not much
literature.  I reported this to Strickland and Miles, who arrived on the
Monday and seemed preoccupied.

<p>

Bech and his team were also having shipping problems, and the Regnecentralen
stand was in turmoil.  I tried to get Thorndyke and Miles in touch, and
succeeded on Wednesday, when the pressure of program changes on Bech
slackened.

<p>

The social side was a great deal more fun.  The Pilotys took some of us to a
sumptuous lunch, and introduced me to iced eau de vie de poire as an aperitif.
I no longer remember the main course, but ...

<p>

Halle 7 of the Congress Centre was underwhelmed by the exhibition, which while
substantial for Europe was a tenth the size of the Spring Joint Computer
Conference that had been held in San Francisco four months earlier.  There
were fewer exhibitors, of course, and the stands were rather small - although
IBM Deutschland was impressive.  And attendance was disappointing; the crowd
was an academic one, and wanted to talk ALGOL rather than price-and-delivery,
and the technical sessions were being held at the TH rather than at the
Centre.

<p>

Of the companies I visited on the tape drive tour Bull, Electrologica, Facit,
Ferranti, ICT, Olivetti, SEPSEA, SEL, SAAB, Telefunken, Zuse, and of course
Siemens had exhibits; of the competitive drive makers Ampex, Compteurs, and
Potter were showing.

<p>

I hand-lettered a blank CDC badge, saying "Consultant", and hung out at the
stand most of the time, thereby missing some important but grindingly dull [I
was told] papers at the TH.

<p>

I still have the small [110 by 165 mm!] papers list put out by North Holland;
the English version runs 96 pages.  Few items have stood the test of time and
change, and I value it more for the names of the authors and their 1962
affiliations.  But here are a few samples:

There are many more names in the 10 August List of Participants, some of them
no-shows: my admired Klaus Wenke, for example.  There are 1300 or so,
foreshadowing a smaller turn-out than the 4000 predicted in the Spring
(Bergstein says 2800, which sounds about right).

<p>

There was a fair number of Eastern Europeans; there had been only a few in
Paris in 1959 - men like Dorodycin and Turski.  This time there was
representation from Belgrade and Ljubljana and so on.

<p>

Looking at the names as I write, I regret the friends like Ed Berkeley and
John Carr and Stan Gill who have died, and take pleasure in those like Gene
Amdahl and Heinz Zemanek who still flourish.  I thought of recording the
attendees who are mentioned in chapters before and after this one, but there
were too many - and such long arrays are dull to look at.

<p>

I took Hal and Jane to Zur Kanne, and Langefors introduced me to Ewige Lampe.
On the TH side, van der Poel offered me the chairmanship of a Tuesday session,
which was flattering.  Looking at the August DATAMATION coverage today I see
pictures of Bech, Billing, Garwick, Langefors, van der Poel, van Wijngaarden
and Wilkes (and others not mentioned in these pages).  It was a good deal more
intimate than a Joint in the States!

<p>

On the last day we were together I told Strickland and Miles that I intended
to go to the British Computer Society meeting as a way of utilizing the four
or five days of my current agreement with them, which expired at the end of
September.  "Better than just sitting in Monaco and letting it run out," I
said.  "Fox of Oxford and Douglas of C-E-I-R will be there, having passed up
this show, and both of them are potential 1604 or 3600 customers."  Since
Stevens was tied up with his pre-CDC affairs, and was nervous about using me
in view of Strickland's obvious contempt, I thought it unlikely I could do
anything else for them in September, and worth the travel expenses.

<p>

Miles and Thorndyke told me Norris himself was coming over to see ICT at the
end of October, and that pleased me.  But when I asked if I could help they
shrugged me off.  I made a mental note to call Bill in Minneapolis when he was
getting ready to come, and closed down that part of the discussion.

<p>

Miles then suggested I might do a market investigation in Japan, something
like the first European tour, and I jumped at it, especially as he mentioned
inquiries from India also - probably Tata, although I no longer remember.
Parenthetically, it got up to the board of directors, who said Control Data
had enough on its plate already and turned the idea down.  Anyhow, I took this
as a sign that the fifty visits had been useful, even if Strickland wasn't
speaking to me!

<p>

Thorndyke took off on his 606 visits, Strickland went down to Zurich, and
Miles flew back to Minnesota taking Stevens with him.  And I took Swissair
Convairs back to Nice.

<p>

Before I left Munich I sat down at a travel agency and worked over the ABC,
looking as usual for new adventures and cheap fares.  Having in mind the
British holiday-making flights, I looked at Cardiff and Bristol connections to
the south of France and Spain, and sure enough there was a charter-type
airline (Derby) I had never heard of, operating a DC-4 into and out of Palma
de Mallorca.

<p>

The agency was dubious, but said they would send a teletype , and sold me a
through ticket relying on the mileage rule that governed in those infinitely
simpler times.  I did Nice/Barcelona/ Palma on KLM.  Heavens knows what the
whole routing was: Amsterdam-Lisbon, maybe, or even Casablanca!

<p>

Actually the fare was double what it should have been, because the
Palma/Bristol leg was at package-tour rates, and by paying a small, ahem, fee
in Palma I got most of it back in pesetas.

<p>

It was my first touchdown in Spain, and certainly not a typical one.  I had
all day to look around, as the DC-4 didn't take off with its full load of
fully loaded Brits until after midnight.  My log says 4h30m, but it was
mid-morning before I swaggered off in Cardiff.

<p>

My recollection of that particular BCS meeting is hazy - nothing like the
sharp memories of Cambridge three years before.  I have found no souvenirs in
my files, and the BCS publications were pretty much confined to papers lists
and such.  It was the very first national computer meeting ever held outside
the London/Cambridge/Oxford ambiance, and I believe the first centering on a
hotel.

<p>

I do remember spending most of my time with Sandy Douglas, who knew something
about Wales and a great deal about what had happened in C-E-I-R.  I now had
the time to tell him of some of the strange doings in Control Data; he was
amused at the story about the Luzern faux pas and agreed that even if CDC
landed the Polytechnic order their name would be mud in German-speaking
Switzerland for a long time.

<p>

The meeting was only for three days, and on the Thursday [6 September] I
boarded my first Air Lingus flight and took off for Dublin.  My previous Irish
touchdowns had always been in Shannon: this gave me the chance to visit
Trinity - as a tourist, since I had no hopes of helping CDC take business
there away from IBM or ICT.  The Book of Kells was on exhibit, and the beauty
of the older buildings was impressive, but the days of technical excitement
were decades in the future.

<p>

Two nights at Irish hotel prices ran under eight pounds, so I was not exactly
breaking the bank!  I flew from Dublin direct to Idlewild, still via Air
Lingus, and was delighted to find Elizabeth at the exit from Customs.  I had
to tell her it had been a painful voyage with Norris And Company.

<p>

This was a difficult time in the U.S.  The Cold War was heating up.  I worried
about what Elizabeth and Grace and Deo would do if Russian missiles from the
reported Cuban emplacements began to hit Manhattan and Washington.  This
chapter is about Norris and Strickland, not Khrushchev and Castro, but it
bears mentioning that I bought a .357 S&amp;W Magnum and gave "the girls"
instructions about filling the bathtubs or at least not flushing the toilet
tanks.

<p>

They were on a high floor, and during elevator strikes I had found carrying a
fifteen-pound ancient poodle down and especially up all those stairs quite
daunting; Aunt Grace, well over eighty, looked almost impossible.  I deeply
regretted that she, and Elizabeth and Deo, were not in the little apartment
outside Salzburg.

<p>

At the very heighth of the crisis Stevens called me to meet with him in
Frankfurt.  In the painfully long letter to the Control Data lawyers next
spring I wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>

He asked me to stop off and see him on the 26th to discuss what further I
might do with him for CDC, and we reviewed at that time my reports on visits
to prospects.  He planned then to use me in those countries where CDC would
not immediately wish to set up a sales organization, and especially in France
and Italy.  He further told me that Strickland had set up a meeting with ICT
London involving Norris himself, for the end of October.  We agreed I might be
able to help there, since I was the original contact there (second, 606,
mission).  I tried that night to call Norris, and finally reached him on his
ocean liner (!).  He was pleasant if somewhat surprised, but said I must clear
the matter with Strickland.  I called the latter at his home in Minneapolis;
he first said he had "objected to" some of the charges on my last invoice [15
October]; he then went on to agree that I should come to London, at least
(there were of course other visits scheduled), at my usual fee and expenses.
I called Stevens the next morning and reported this, jubilantly.  He then
informed me Strickland had just called him and had said inter alia that he had
cancelled out the idea - and in a few hours I got a curt and ugly cable
confirming the fact.

</blockquote>
<p>

I flew back to Monte-Carlo in a daze, stopping off in Zurich to cash my two
New York letters of credit for 9,012 less-vulnerable Swiss francs and 1243
French ones.  I spent the next day paying my bills with the latter in the
Principality and getting ready for a long and possibly terminal absence.  My
world looked about to come apart.

<p>

I took a PanAm flight to Miami via Lisbon to assess the crisis close up (it
was in its last, crucial, day), bought more ammunition for the Magnum, and
arrived back in New York utterly drained.
  
Next day it was all over.

<p>

I turned some of my fail-safe European money back into Sutton House currency
and settled back to a long series of invoices and complaints and finally,
interactions with CDC counsel.  It was clear that the relationship was
shattered.  Indeed, it was many years before Norris and I got together again,
and we had both mellowed considerably before that happened.  Notably, harsh
"Bull" Norris, as I called him in anger, had seen the light - on the Road To
Damascus, I claimed - and was by then engaged with social issues and PLATO,
the biggest experiment in computer-assisted instruction.

<p>

I had been watching the devious interest of the gigantic Philips organization
in designing and building and selling computers.  I could see with
unquestioning clarity that they were about to repeat the General Electric
experience.  I was sure that even if they would not believe me, or were
internally committed to a dubious course of action, they should hear my
experiences in GE and my opinions of Watson Junior's IBM.  The question was,
how to penetrate?

<p>

I had two routes.  One was through their internal user community; it was very
expert, very productive, very aware of the American experience - and very
keen.  Precisely like the situation in Generous Electric just before the
beginnings of the Phoenix imbroglio!

<p>

I had tapped into that fairly forcefully with the meeting Rudy Lunbeck had set
up.  The CDC involvement was now impossible, but the concept of a C-E-I-R-type
cooperative remained alive.

<p>

But there was a second route.  Through the Mathematisch Centrum and Aad van
Wijngaarten I had introductions to the research side of Philips, which with
the exception of the Bell Labs did the best industrial research in the world,
slightly better than GE and a fair way ahead of IBM, which was however moving
up very fast under the leadership of the Piore/Williams/Watson Junior team.

<p>

This led me to a Professor Unk, who had recently retired as the liaison
between the Philips board and the research laboratories.  He was impressive
but approachable, and the fact that I had been a high-level insider in the IBM
development and research enterprises was not lost on him, although like the
senior figures in Murray Hill he did not fully approve of the computing
explosion.

<p>

We met once in New York, where he was involved as a "consultant" to North
American Philips.  I found myself unwelcome there, not because of the computer
connection (which they valued more than the parent company), but because I had
come in from the top instead of as a grateful suppliant from below.  Didn't
matter a bit to Unk, who was terrific.

<p>

After we met a second time, in Europe but not at his Isys consultancy, which I
never visited, he passed me on to his successor, a vigorous man in his fifties
with five or six languages.  His name was Lopes Cardozo, and he put me up at a
new hotel in Eindhoven which catered almost entirely to Philips and its
visitors.  It was called the Cocagne, a lovely and unusual name.

<p>

I was sure this was my only chance, so I put caution aside and said bluntly
that "even Philips" would have a tough tough time against IBM, and even in
northern Europe.  He was not incensed, but not happy with me either.  "We are
known around the world for our research, our engineering, our manufacturing,
the variety and reliability of our products.  And as you say we are large and
expert users of IBM and competitive equipment ..."

<p>

Perhaps incautiously I broke in to remind him that all these good things,
which I agreed were important, were true of my old employer General Electric
also.  "What GE lacked, and did not realize it lacked, and still lacks six
years after its entry into the computer business, is the special and
world-renowned marketing skills IBM has developed under the Watsons", I said.

<p>

He brushed it aside.  "All Philips needs is to develop those sales skills (he
never referred to the product planning, the sales intelligence, the customer
engineering [maintenance] components)," he said.  We never got anywhere near
the question of whether I could help either in developing the skills or in
figuring how to distribute them; he was after all primarily a
research-oriented executive.  I suggested mildly that the North American
subsidiary was concerned about IBM - which was an exaggeration: the American
executives I had met were, the Dutch were not.  We parted after a lovely
dinner, and I found out next morning he was paying the hotel bill.  Nice!

<p>

After all these years I stll have the official letter he sent me.  It was
definite:

<p>
<blockquote>

  ... I have come to the conclusion that we will not follow up your proposal.

<p>

  Neither will it be of interest to have unsollicitated [sic] consultation for
  the first two years in the area we discussed.

<p>

  I have advised Messrs. Unk and Vernes [top Dutch executive at NAPhilips]
  accordingly so that we do not spend our time in vain.

<p>

  With kind regards,

<p>
<center>
                                               Yours sincerely,

<p>

                                       N.V. PHILIPS' GLOEILAMPENFABRIEKEN,

<p>

  M.  Lopes Cardozo

</center>
</blockquote>
<p>

Three strikes and out!

<p>

The story of the tentative entry of the great company into the computer
business in the mid-Sixties, and its ignominous departure, is still well known
in Europe, and was exploited by IBM World Trade much more strongly than
Galactic Headquarters had dared to exploit the GE and RCA failures.
DATAMATION covered it fitfully in years when I was no longer a contributing
editor, and I had no personal experience with it.  But after my stay at the
Cocagne I knew exactly what would happen.

<p>

The period at the end of the Control Data relationship was a painful one.  I
was sure the fumbling incursions from Minneapolis would mature into a
rewarding presence in a dozen countries, and that the contacts I had made on
both swings would be helpful - starting with the ones at CERN and with Bech at
Regnecentralen.  But I was to have no further part in that exciting expansion.

<p>

I had been unable to get past Vin Learson and share in the IBM space
successes.  Now I was unable to get past Ed Strickland and share in the CDC
European advent.

<p>

And I was having trouble focussing on computers and even on my own future in
the trade.  My family affairs were painful, painful - and drew me back across
the Atlantic.  When I had descended on Sutton House for Christmas I found Aunt
Grace desperately ill, with a nurse helping Elizabeth in what was clearly a
last illness.  She was 83; her body was giving up; only her desire not to
leave her beloved niece and her much-loved D?odat kept her alive.

<p>

I was aware that "the little boy", as we all three called him, was also ready
to go.  He had been blind for two years, but still pleased with his daily
walks and his professional grooming; he had enjoyed Manhattan more than Grace!
But now his coat was thinning, his gait was slowing, his kidneys were giving
up the ten-year battle with hardpad.  We had a good vet, and close by, so that
on bad days I could carry him over for shots or dental work.  Elizabeth and I
had agreed long ago that when life became a burden to the wonderful little guy
we would do him the final favor, but for the moment we wanted him to go on for
Grace's sake.

<p>

And right after Christmas day Dad's best friends out in the Detroit area
called to say that he was in serious trouble.  When he had been with us in New
York he had been having difficulty swallowing; I had told him it was a natural
reaction to Mother's unexpected death, and that he would feel better when he
got home and relaxed.  But Elizabeth and I both thought it was more than
emotional, and debated whether to urge him to see a Manhattan doctor.

<p>

Now it was clearly cancer of the throat, and he was about to be hospitalized.
I rushed out on the 28th, telling him I had business at Burroughs and Chrysler
"in a few days" (which indeed I managed to put together, telling Ray Macdonald
the Burroughs president about my European adventures as a presumed explorer of
B5000 possibilities).

<p>

His dear friend Frieda Johnson was terribly upset, telling him and me and the
other people who cared that they had planned a long cross-country drive
together in the Spring.  It was obvious he found my presence irritating and my
cautious remarks about Grace's illness depressing.  I went away.

<p>

I came back on the 9th of January and saw him into hospital on the 12th.  He
began a beastly regimen of nitrogen mustard, which indeed controlled the
growth of the now-obvious tumor but was rackingly painful.  I stayed with him,
tried to distract him with homely stuff - no European and very few British
stories.  Grace and Deo were battling on, back in Sutton House.

<p>

On February 2nd the doctor began to explore the family situation.  I was the
only child, I said, and Mother had died the year before.  There were no other
relatives.  He had made no will, and I was responsible for his medical bills.
Quietly I was asked what to do: continue the treatment under increasingly
heavy sedation?  I did not bother Elizabeth, or ask Frieda what she wanted.
Stop the mustard, I said.

<p>

The hospital called at five in the morning of the 13th.  I sat quietly by his
bedside and listened to the labored breathing.  The nurses left us alone.  And
while I sat there, he died.  He was 75.

<p>

He was still handsome.  He had smoked heavily for sixty years.

<p>

Dorothy and I had called on George Dondero when he represented the Royal Oak
area of Michigan in Congress while we were amateurishly lobbying for the
Federation of Atomic Scientists back in 1946, relying on the fact that Frieda
Johnson was his housekeeper.  Now 17 years later I asked him to take the small
estate through probate, have the little house Dad had finished with his own
hands a decade back sold, the title to the small Plymouth sedan transferred -
the closing down of a quiet life.  Bert Grosch, as he had always been called,
was a good husband, a good father, and a very expert cabinetmaker.

<p>

He was buried next to Mother on the 15th.  I asked his many friends to help
Frieda empty the little house on Ten Mile Road, reserving for myself only my
mother's family souvenirs and the seven violins he had made.  Just now, 35
years later, I used letters I wrote them from places like Bad Hersfeld to
reawaken memories.

<p>

When the title had cleared I signed the Plymouth over to Frieda, suggesting
that she go on that long trip she had planned with my father.  Take a friend,
I said, and remember how much Dad would have enjoyed being with you.

<p>

Back in Manhattan things were getting worse.  I had appointments to keep in
the Netherlands, notably the meeting at the Cocagne on February 27th.  After
that disappointment I went back to Monaco and tried to straighten out my
suspended affairs, but letters from Elizabeth made it hard to concentrate.  It
didn't help that I was missing her March 6 birthday.

<p>

My attempts to generate new major consultancies were not going well.  I was
corresponding with Burroughs and Remington Rand about helping their European
businesses.  The latter possibility led me to drive up to Lausanne in my
now-repaired scarlet Alfa convertible to see the temporary management which
had opened a UNIVAC-oriented office in Jordils, a building on the upper edge
of the lake port Ouchy.  Clearly there could be small assignments, at about
the level of the stuff I had worked up for Dick Jennison, but the bank account
back in Manhattan needed more than that.

<p>

Parenthetically, while these minor efforts were under way, I was coming close
to settling with Control Data.  The Minneapolis lawyers had their problems
with Strickland, who was often in Switzerland or Germany when they needed to
talk to him.  In the end, more in exasperation than from conviction, they got
CDC to send me a check for $2298 and I wrote off the rest.  It arrived at
Sutton House on May 20th, nineteen months after my first cable from Jim Miles.

<p>

It was costing a good deal to live at the R?sidence Auteuil and eat at the
wonderful Bec Rouge.  I had been to the Monaco Grand Prix [March 26] and seen
Rainier and Princess Grace.  I had driven down to Milan for the Congress on
Man and Technology in the Space Age, wearing my tattered Rocket Society
presidency and having a great lunch with Arthur Clarke.  It was time to shut
up shop and go help Elizabeth.

<p>

I sold the gorgeous Alfa 2600 in Nice.  I got my apartment deposit back.  I
had one last dinner at the Bec Rouge.  I packed my papers and the coffee mill
and the linens I had acquired so gaily that first January [1962], and found a
warehouse.  And on May 2nd I set out on the last trip of my first, my solo,
European venture, by serious Swissair instead of frivolous Air France.

<p>

I had filled six pages of my air log: over 90 flights.  I had bought and
driven and sold two cars, eaten in magnificent restaurants, stayed in
wonderful hotels.  More important, I now had a mental data base of how
technical computing was going in Europe that only the unique pairing of actual
residence and ongoing U.S.connections could afford.  And I had new friends.

<p>

But financially I had barely broken even.  All my Control Data fees totalled
under $20,000.  I was no closer to a firm relationship than when I arrived in
Monte-Carlo.  And Dad and Mother were dead, and Grace and Deo were dying.

<p>

Elizabeth and I talked quietly about New York.  She had had little pleasure
from it while I was gone, and we both guessed the apartment, which she loved
so much, would be dreadful after Grace left it.  I wanted to go back to
Europe, although we both could see it was risky business.  Elizabeth had
delighted in my stories, and fitted herself mentally into the new frame.  She
agreed the Salzburg gambit that I had regretfully shut down was worth
exploring again.

<p>

I walked our blind little boy through the hot summer and early fall, using a
stiff short leash intended for a big dog to steer him around the
apartment-house stanchions and the fire plugs.  He revived a little with my
attentions, and Elizabeth and I occasionally could slip away to our favorite
Chinese restaurant.  And with me to Grace-sit she was able to shop or enjoy
Fifth Avenue, which she had not been able to do after the nurse of the
previous Spring had left.

<p>

I went to local ACM meetings, tried to write about my travels for DATAMATION,
revived a few IBM and GE friendships that I had let slide.  But mostly, I
waited.

<p>

Grace died peacefully in the last days of winter.  She had been more than a
mother to my dear wife, and had shared almost every day with her for more than
forty years; it was a crushing separation.  We got the little blue Chevrolet
sedan out of the Sutton House garage, bundled up feeble old Deo against the
stresses of a long and bitter bitter drive, and put the simple coffin into the
ground in Napoleon, Ohio - the Yeager family plot.  Deo stood at attention on
his short lead as the last phrases were read, the last goodbyes said.  Already
he missed her.

<p>

But not for long.  Depressed by our depression, weakened by every walk down on
First Avenue, he sank rapidly.  In early March we fulfilled our last duty to
him: held him as the vet gave the last injection, bundled him in his familiar
blanket, and went in a big Manhattan cab out to the crematory.  It was by a
considerable margin the worst day of my life.

<p>

I no longer remember how the lease arrangements at Douglas Elliman were
handled.  At a guess I think we may have made a month-to-month extension
instead of a sixth calendar-year lease, since Grace's death was obviously
imminent.  I remember vividly, however, personally wrapping and packing and
reinforcing the grandfather clock before the regular movers came, so that
Elizabeth could bear to see it go into storage - and the fountains of tears
when as they emptied the apartment we saw the band of black marks around the
baseboards where our blind poodle had rubbed his hardpad-damaged nose as he
found his way about.

<p>

We were destroyed.  Yes, the new life beckoned.  Yes, I had turned the prized
Ohio Chevrolet in and promised my wife a beautiful new Porsche which we would
pick up at the factory in May.  But there was little laughter; we were free to
eat out every night now, and cruise the elegancies of midtown, but we didn't.

<p>

On April 1st, a bitter joke, we took an excessive number of suitcases and two
mink stoles off to Idlewild.  It speaks to my frame of mind that there is a
year-long gap in my air logs; since my passport says Prestwick I would guess
we flew SAS, but not in the honeymoon exuberance of 1957.  I don't remember a
train journey, so I suppose we transhipped to Heathrow.  I do remember the
Savoy!

<p>

London aroused Elizabeth from the worst of her sadnesses.  I was busy checking
plans; as part of the purchase of the Porsche there was to be a rental station
wagon ready for us at the C?te d'Azur airport, and we had packed so as to
forward most of the baggage on ahead.  It would be a fatal mistake today, and
was courting disaster even in 1964.  I cabled to Monaco to have my trunk and
boxes disinterred and ready for pickup.  I fiddled with the London Porsche
people, who were stuffy about the suggestion of possible problems.

<p>

I think we did not try to see any of my British friends, who in fact had not
yet learned of our arrival, or of our bereavements.  I would normally have
wanted to trot out Boz Ferranti for my beautiful wife, but these were not the
days.  We did not go to the theater, which speaks volumes about Elizabeth's
depression.  Bookstores, Fortnums, and a lot of walking: we were decompressing
in spite of ourselves.

<p>

On the 10th we arrived at the Nice airport.  Yes, a scruffy German courier had
a car for us; yes, it was as ordered; yes, for sure, there were lots of
papers.  And when we drove around to air freight, mirabile dictu, there was
our unaccompanied baggage!!  In the best spirits we had been in in two months,
we sailed off to Monte-Carlo, the H?tel de Paris (one night) and my Bec
Rouge.

<p>

Elizabeth looked gorgeous in Grace's platinum mink stole, and delightfully
high heels.  Roger the Bec Rouge owner was suitably impressed, and so were
several other customers.  I showed my reviving bride the corner table I had
occupied dozens of times, which Roger had held for me the night before the
Grand Prix while a horde of eager race buffs lined up outside.

<p>

Next morning we recovered my belongings, which added to what we had brought
from New York pretty well filled the Opel mid-sized wagon.  It would never
have fitted in Ranch!  And we set out for Salzburg.

<p>

Elizabeth did not want to try driving, although even back in 1964 her New York
license would have been sufficient to operate a rental car anywhere in Western
Europe.  I had been carrying an international license since November 1961, and
in fact had renewed it during the dreary wait in Sutton House, but I don't
believe she ever bothered to get one.  I had thought to distract her from our
slowly lightening depression, but in fact the scenery of northern Italy and
the freshness of the adventure did very well.

<p>

We went along via Menton and the coast route and up over the same pass where I
had raced her train on our honeymoon, and probably stayed at my usual
Continentale in Milan.  It is a mark of the troubles of the last chapter that
where the pleasures of 1957 - the hotels, the wonderful restaurants, the trip
to Capri - are still fresh in my mind today, I recall almost nothing of April
1964.

<p>

I must have shown her where the big Alfa was wrecked below the Brenner, and
the Hospiz of my first St. Silvester.  She had read my letters and seen my
slides and listened, with Grace and Deo, to hours of my stories.  But neither
my memory nor my records confirm it.  Certainly we took our time: I had no
engagements; we had no address - mail would be forwarded from the Sutton House
mail room when we achieved one.  Everything that was not warehoused in upper
Manhattan was right there in the black station wagon.  I must have cabled
ahead to the Schl?ssl - or did we stay in town at the Goldener Hirsch?
Blanked out!

<p>

But I remember my disappointment at Elizabeth's reaction.  She thought
Salzburg "medieval", disliked the narrow streets and the overhanging upper
stories, and did not find the lovely open views down toward Hellbrunn enough
compensation.  And she did not like the language; the harshness of Hamburg
might have been a little more acceptable, but the local Austrian version
bothered her dramatics-tuned ear.

<p>

I saw regretfully that my investigations of how to live cheaply and
unobtrusively in that area, my questions about taxes and telephones and dog
tags and the fremdenpolizei that I had asked when I planned to bring the whole
family over, had been wasted.  I had worn out my welcome in Monaco, and to
live as Elizabeth would want in that golden clime did not look economically
feasible.  I thought about Vienna, which to a New York City lover like my
sophisticated wife ought to have looked pretty good, but for reasons lost to
me now we discarded the idea: language, perhaps.

<p>

We talked as we turned west again about London.  It had been ruled out earlier
by the ridiculous animal quarantine, just as it was to be ruled out in the
early Eighties when I returned to Europe yet again.  But we no longer had a
poodle [sob!!].  Elizabeth loved the city, loved the theater, loved and had
taught the language.  And of course my connections were manifold, and fresh,
and probably could be developed rapidly.  I could see operating out of
Ferranti's City offices, or trying to get in on the other side of the probable
ICT/CDC relationship.  On Park Lane!

<p>

But I also remembered that the RemRand activity in Lausanne was in its
formative stage, and that my good friend Gordon Smith had been reported in a
recent DATAMATION to be headed in that direction.  So I suggested to my
seatmate that we go all the way to the Romande [French Switzerland] instead of
turning north toward Basel, and she thought it a fine idea.

<p>

I had been put up at the Beau Rivage on my 1963 visit: a magnificent but
extremely expensive venue.  The locum tenens, Luther Harr, had picked up the
tab, and since Jordils was just three blocks up the hill probably had a
substantial account going.  We were paying our own way this time, and after
brooding over Swiss guidebooks [Michelin was decades from putting out a Red
Guide] I chose the H?tel de la Paix in the heart of town, which was fairly
cheap and adjacent to underground parking.  We intended to stay only a day or
two, and were worried about our belongings packed densely in the wagon - even
in Switzerland.

<p>

I had not telephoned from Austria, but when we crossed into der Schweiz I
called ahead and found that Gordon had indeed arrived from the U.S. and was in
full bloom, was out of town that day but could see me when he returned.  So
after we settled into our not-too-luxurious quarters I arranged a date next
morning.  It was early Spring, and Lausanne and the lake - Lake Leman, since
we were beyond the reach of the Genevans - was getting ready.  Crocuses would
have been finished, tulips at their height.

<p>

I was amused to find that the ultra-short funicular that descended from the
heart of Lausanne through the busy mainline rail station to the Evian ferry
wharf on the lake had a stop named Jordils.  I found the building bustling
with RemRand activity (there were apartments above, which I never entered).
This was partly due to the increase in staff and partly to the ongoing
installation of a service bureau/demonstration site on the ground floor - a
minor SS card-oriented system.

<p>

The first surprise when I climbed to the first [U.S. "second"] floor reception
area was that I was greeted by my old friend Pier Abetti of GE Pittsfield
days.  Pier it soon turned out had been hired away by the Univackers to second
Gordon, who in turn was theoretically next-in-European-command to John
Jackson.  John was also an ex-IBMer, and like Gordon and most other Golden
Boys (tall, handsome, great salesmen, and close to Tom Watson Junior) had only
English; Pier not only was a genuinely distinguished engineering computer user
but could sputter as intelligibly in French and Italian as in English, and had
a good fund of German, and could fake Spanish.

<p>

It was a wonderful conjunction, and should have really put a thumb in the eye
of World Trade Europe.  It did not, in the end, partly because of the enormous
IBM initiative worldwide which was firing up, partly because the guys back in
Blue Bell were third-raters, and partly because in spite of his electrical
engineering and computer user skills Pier was very very far from a Golden-Boy
smoothie.  I was too, of course, but in an orthogonal direction - and Gordon
already knew and liked me.

<p>

About Pittsfield: back in my Evendale apogee one of my other-GE-division
clients was Power Transformer, which in western Massachusetts a little remote
from the unions designed and built huge custom transformers almost as big as
the turbines and generators Hans Kraft spent his career improving; boxcar
size, and bigger.

<p>

Their key computer pioneers were Pier, whom I had immediately realized was the
son of the great solar astronomer Giorgio Abetti of the Arcetri observatory
near Florence, and his sidekick Stan Williams.  Pier had come to GE because of
his research interest in lightning damage or threats of damage to transformers
and switchgear; he ran an expensive laboratory which reminded me of all the
Evendale component test stands and flame tunnels.  But by the time he became a
customer of my 701 and 704s he had embarked on a remarkably ambitious and
still little-known experiment in what later came to be called integrated
systems, rivalling and more immediately successful than Allen Keller's steam
power plant expert systems.

<p>

He and Stan soon got a 705, a choice strange to me even today but probably
dictated by conservative Pittsfield [finance?] management.  On it they built a
software system which put together some - in fact, most - of the design
philosophy of the department, fully automated the onerous drafting process,
put out manufacturing shop orders, and even sent out invoices and printed
shipping notices!

<p>

Turned out that as in the tin airplane business you spent more time on
paperwork (engineering design, manufacturing schedules, and financial
tracking) than in cutting metal.  This really pioneering achievement, more
encompassing as it neared completion at the end of the Fifties than the larger
efforts at Lockheed and Convair, was never described in the management or
electrical literature, and is referred to only scantily in the minor computer
journals, even DATAMATION except in my side remarks there.

<p>

This was because GE division and group management wanted to retain a
competitive edge for the department, and it worked, for a year or two.  But
the lack of professional recognition drove a terrific man, almost of Steinmetz
or Langmuir stature, out of the company: a bad deal.  I was reminded later of
the way BASF lost out when they mismanaged Klaus Wenke.

<p>

Digging up the story would be a fine computer- or EE-history project.

<p>

Back to Ouchy: Pier whisked me in to see Gordon, babbling his story at top
speed the while.  After a warm embrace and a recap of my previous short visit
, Gordon fixed me with a penetrating stare.  "Do you know about the 360
announcement, Herb?" he asked.  Only what I see in the Herald Tribune, I
replied.

<p>

Yes, it was that week.  IBM, the Grim Gray Giant of my DATAMATION stories, had
kicked the software stool out from under every 700/7000 user worldwide, and
left them to dangle.  It is an amazing story, somewhat misunderstood by the
historians even today.  I protested in my popular review of the Watson Junior
autobiography years later, but it has had little effect so far:

<p>
<blockquote>

Tom and his henchmen were afraid of General Electric in 1956, of RCA in 1965,
of the Washington antitrust pygmies, of European rivals.  The long story about
the "necessity" to develop, announce, sell, manufacture, install and service
the 360 is engrossing - and completely misleading.

<p>

Certainly Tom Junior and
Vin Learson and Dick Watson all believed they were being overtaken by the
competition, and had to make an enormous investment - "bet the company",
goggle-eyed journalists wrote - to stay in front.  And, as we all know, they
made that investment.

<p>

But I was consulting for Univac Europe at the time, and
could see only too clearly that neither Univac nor any other of the Seven
Dwarfs, nor all seven collectively, could pick up any major share of the IBM
customer base if the 360 fell on its face.  They didn't have the sales forces,
the manufacturing capacities, or the service organizations.  If the
competition increased its share of the world market by fifty percent - an
unimaginable accomplishment - IBM's share would have dropped from 70 to 55
percent!

</blockquote>
<p>

Gordon had already installed a handsome desk in the rather puny Jordils
office.  He spun around to the matching credenza and heaved over to me a
foot-thick stack of red folders: at least twenty, some of them an inch
thick. "This is what I've been able to get so far," he growled.

<p>

Typically, he
had had salesmen fan out over the whole of Europe and secure photocopies of
the IBM technical announcement material.  He hadn't waited, as Harr or Jackson
would have done, for the U.S.  marketing people to collect a set and send it
in the equivalent of a diplomatic pouch - not Gordon!!  I fumbled at the top
folder, my eyes bugging out: 168 pages entitled "Principles of Operation
[S360-01]", labeled A22-6821-0, the first edition!  Beneath it was an
introductory folder of only 44 pages, "System Summary" labeled C28-6510-0,
apparently the twentieth item in the series.

<p>

Gordon's team had snaffled 27
items and a price list, out of what later analysis showed to have been
something like 36.  They also had copied one-page "configurators" for five of
the six announced systems, and for I/O and communications gear.  I expressed
my amazement and approval.

<p>

"Herb, what am I going to do with this stack?" he
snarled.  "It will be months before the gang in Philadelphia sends competitive
analyses out, let alone to us over here.  And I have announcements coming up
..."  The 1108, I asked, making him all the more unhappy, since it was
supposed to be a deep secret - as the 360 had truly been.

<p>

Soon we were at
grips.  I knew almost nothing of his direction and the terms of his
vice-presidency; he knew only what the trade gossip had carried about my
Control Data adventures, and nothing of the family agonies.  But we were both
madly anxious to find out what IBM intended.  And, as I said happily to
Elizabeth back at the hotel, "he has money!"

<p>

We agreed I would plow through
the thousand pages of technical stuff, come up not only with serious
comparisons with existing and unannounced UNIVAC models but with pointed sales
arguments for the continent-wide sales force, and offer advice to him
personally.

<p>

Sperry Rand International Corporation would pick up six weeks of
living expenses at the de la Paix level, including the portion due to
Elizabeth, but no travel or car expenses (I had sort of hoped to cover my trip
to pick up the Porsche in Sindelfingen, which would come toward the end of the
period).  And a healthy fee, without the kind of wrangling Strickland and even
Norris felt compelled to do.  On a handshake basis: I trusted Big Gordon
implicitly. 

<p>

I settled in to the very challenging job with a will.  Elizabeth
had the use of the Opel, which we had unloaded into the hotel except for my
trunk of heavy books and papers.  With it she cruised the area, already
convinced we should stay in Lausanne.

<p>

She was befriended by Pier's New
Englander wife Betty - yes, Betty Abetti - whose poetry writing and
bilingualism she much admired.  They lived further out along the lake with
their kids and hobbies [but no pets, as I remember; we thought it strange].
We had pasta feasts there, and took the family in turn to lakeside restaurants
which tended at the lower price levels to feature tiny fillets of lake perch
with competitive home-made tartar sauces.  And carafes of white wine.

<p>

Now I
come to a sticking point: how much to write about the announcement material?
I gave above the labels of two key pieces of the thirty, and this would be
sufficient to follow if any historian cares to do so.

<p>

I still have the raw
handwritten work sheets from which I did my summary, and could extract scores
of pages that would bore readers silly.  I found not only hen-scratch
calculation (no TI hand calculators for another ten years, and not one
Marchant or Friden in the whole building!) but detailed comparisons of
hypothetical machines with parallel 1107 equipment - that is, assortments of
360 componentry I myself might have ordered for one of my GE shops, or for
C-E-I-R.  And in comparisons of both speed and money, much to Gordon's relief
[and my 1999 amusement] the 1107s didn't come off too badly.

<p>

But the major
RemRand systems couldn't be squeezed down to a 360/30 or even a 360/40, nor
could a really big set-up compare with the IBM claims for a 360/70.  The
heralded breadth of the announced spectrum was impressive.

<p>

Instead of
flogging two long-lost competitive horses, I give verbatim [including
solecisms I regret today] the notes for my talk for senior Lausanne staff,
from Jackson and Smith and Abetti down to visitors from the Swiss and German
sales staff.  (I will describe the people involved later.)

<p>

The people who were to select sales arguments from this farrago were Gordon
himself, a market research chap named Kent Ellsworth who later left computing
and became a tennis pro (!!), and the local equivalent of the IBM World Trade
Future Demands Department (reputedly a dozen strong in Paris alone), one Hans
Flesch.  Jackson couldn't or at least wouldn't, and Abetti was too wrapped up
in the technical details in the thousand pages, and especially in the material
on the operating system, disclosed in stupefying and already obsolete detail
in 30 pages on control programs, 86 pages of Assembler, 95 pages of COBOL, and
on and on and on.  (FORTRAN was an embarrassment, and was called Special
Support.)

<p>

I tried to discourage him, since my DATAMATION reading and ACM
correspondents all spoke of NPL, New Programming Language [later of course
PL/1], which IBM Galactic Headquarters had decreed was to replace both FORTRAN
and COBOL if they got around to putting it down on paper where Share and
others could wrangle about it.  

<p>

Hansel thought the whole thing was
unbelievable.  He had language skills like Abetti, a good EE degree, and
unlike Pier sharp business sense.  He and Gordon were the only two people I
could reach who understood how IBM was dealing from strength.  

<p>

There were
other actors on this turbulent although rather small-scale scene.  The most
impressive one, whom I met for the first time but valued as a friend for many
years, was Don Dowd, a very suave PR type who was Gordon's aide-de-camp.  He
was youngish, handsome, beautifully dressed, very wired-in socially.  Two
examples: Gordon's wife was a very high flier, and thought poorly of us
techies.  Elizabeth and I were permitted to enter the elaborate mansion on
occasion, but were obviously "Gordon's business people".  Don, on the other
hand, had impressive family and PR connections, and was reported by Hansel and
Kent to be able to manipulate Her Elegance with ease - more so than Gordon
himself, they agreed.  

<p>

And shortly after I blew into Jordils, Don staged a
gorgeous party at the Beau Rivage for a small team of senior RemRand
executives from the States, with John Jackson as host and the U.S. ambassador
William True Davis (who obviously knew as little about computers, or Sperry
Rand International, as the other senior American ambassadors around Europe).
Charmed Madame Smith and the ladies, including Elizabeth, though!  

<p>

This latter
event was primarily to open the new headquarters.  I still have the fancy but
technically barren brochure Don turned out - not as easy to do in Lausanne as
in Geneva.  It has a handsome picture of Jordils on the cover, a better
portrait of Gordon than of his boss, and a literally unbelievable list of
"Offices of Remington Rand and UNIVAC Divisions in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa" on the back cover.  And the silk cord down the spine is in the
Lausanne colors!  

<p>

I've lost the luncheon menu, which was much more important.

<p>

In the next chapter I'll tell about how the list of nineteen African countries
turned me on, but at the time my recent Control Data tours, which interested
Gordon and Hans and Don enormously, led me to look at the list of European
sites.  I noted only two in England, which reflected the withdrawal of the
round-hole boys into a domestic affiliation, and none in Denmark or
Luxembourg.  I valued it for future business, assuming I survived the 360
load!  

<p>

I began to get replies to letters (there would be ten times as many
today, in a flood of e-mail exchanges, and there would be Web postings).  One
good story was that Lee Amaya, who had taken over most of the direction of the
Lockheed IBM 7000s, had been engaged with his Applied Science rep in exploring
the successor to the 7094II.  On the day of the big 360 announcement, news of
which ran through the aerospace community like a California forest fire, Lee
called his man and asked, "What does this do to the 7095?"  

<p>

There was a
painful silence.  "What 7095?", said Cuthbert's guy!!  

<p>

The obvious thing, even
before the next DATAMATION came off the presses, was that the whole industry
investment in assembly programs and number crunching, the specialized
communications methodology that was coded in raw machine language, and a great
deal of the FORTRAN code, was spurlos versenkt, sunk without a trace.  Pure
higher level programs using the latest IBM versions of COBOL and FORTRAN, and
especially COBOL on the 1401 and 1410, could be emulated (with great pain, and
to run very slowly, I predicted in Lausanne).  But the tin airplane boys, and
Stan Williams back in Pittsfield, and my crews back in Evendale and Lynn, had
patched , and patched the patches - "spaghetti code", we call it now.

<p>

I had
written several articles for DMN denigrating what I called Magic Languages,
saying that they did not make real working programs truly transportable, and
that new machines offered the chance to rethink the flow charts and the
underlying necessities, and to do a more sophisticated job of coding the next
time around.  I pointed out that the Los Alemites had done this as their
famous nuclear codes had moved from wired panels on 601s and 604s and CPCs to
stored programs on 700s and 7000s, and then on to incompatible STRETCH, and
soon to CDC 6600s.  Each time, I said, the increased understanding and more
sophisticated specifications of the problem, and the improved techniques of
writing the software, did more for productivity than the increase in raw speed
[not true for the 1952 jump from CPC to 701, as I well knew from my 701 days -
but I admitted that].  So in theory I was in favor of what Galactic
Headquarters was doing.  

<p>

It amused me to think that Tom Junior was probably
playing his Wild Duck's theories back to resistant customers.  Gordon knew I
felt that way, but reminded me that I was a discredited prophet among the
FORTRANners and the ALGOLiacs.  True, I admitted ruefully.  

<p>

So the first theme
I played for UNIVAC was that no one installation anywhere in the world needed
compatibility across more than at most two interfaces: that a satellite design
(like Surly Seymour's great 6600 concept) was one way of linking feeder
machines like the Census ones in the German case to the big central gizmo in
Dortmund.  Today the jargon is "client/server". 

<p>

Passing to software, I said
that in order to do scientific and business and communications programs in one
single language meant that it would be less efficient than specialized
packages, harder to teach and maintain, and be so big you would need the new
IBM 2361 core to hold it.  My handwritten notes say, "You can't stretch a
rainbow from a mud hut to the king's palace without going pretty high in the
stratosphere!"  

<p>

All but the most sheep-like customers were outraged, and the
more angry ones rushed out to UNIVAC and CDC and Burroughs, saying that if
they were going to be forced to start over from scratch they might as well
stick a thumb in Tom Watson's eye.  But in the end not many defections really
happened, or stood the test of decades.  Enough did that Bill Norris could
expand into Europe, and from his original nuclear and crypto applications into
aerospace.  

<p>

Readers should remember that this was still a rather small
community, full time operators or managers of what today are called
mainframes: UNIVACs I and II, with IIIs beginning, 1107s and soon 1108s, and a
rather small number of mid-range installations; IBM 700s and 7000s, and a lot
of 650s; Burroughs and Control Data and the beginnings of the GE 600 family.
And in Europe, Bull Gammas and a few Siemens 2000s, and in England LEOs and
the range of Ferranti machines.  

<p>

I'd guess there were a thousand big shops (70
per cent IBM worldwide) and maybe ten thousand 650-like installations.  There
were endless estimates, recorded mostly in DATAMATION; my experiences in CDC
and in Jordils confirmed that there was no customer database among the Seven
Dwarfs.  

<p>

I have always assumed IBM had an almost perfect one for North
America, and very complete lists for the World Trade arena - certainly they
had accurate ones of their own installations, and these were seventy percent
of the totality!  But these were never available outside, even as totals (and
especially not as percentages, because of the anti-trust problem).  I wonder
if today's very different company might let their archivists exhume the 1964
data?  

<p>

The circulation of DATAMATION in April 1964 when the first notice of
the 360 explosion appeared was 47,132.  By year-end it was up to 54,150!  But
I will return to that in a minute.  

<p>

Those guessed-at figures mean nearly eight
thousand IBM shops were turned upside down, and over three thousand non-IBM
shops were, as Cuthbert Hurd undoubtedly put it, "given the opportunity of
adopting a new direction in hardware and software".  It was the dawning of a
new era: for IBM, for its hapless competitors, and for the agonized old-user
community across the world.  

<p>

About that booming magazine: it was of course
still coming to the mail room at Sutton House, where it and my ACM
publications (but not things like TIME, which were of course on Swiss
newsstands) would be forwarded when I asked for them.  But the single measly
copy that came to Jordils was two weeks behind its U.S. date, and the April
issue had not put in an appearance when Gordon and I struck hands.  So he and
Hans and I were working from the Herald Tribune and the airmail copies of the
Wall Street Journal, and of course the gigantic pile of photocopies.  

<p>

The DMN
rewrite man gave a three-page summary of the IBM announcement starting on p.51
of the April issue [the Library of Congress copy is timestamped the 21st].
When the Jordils copy arrived, somewhat ahead of my Sutton House forwarding,
it filled in the few lacunae in what I had: for instance, I learned the
performance of the promised IBM hypertapes Tom Kamp had been fretting over for
two years.  I later found it buried in material I already had, in the details
about the nine-channel (!!) 2400-series mag tapes.  Anyhow, they were now
called 7340s, and ran at 340,000 alphameric or 680,000 numeric characters a
second, ten times the speed of the CDC 606s.  Whether any had been delivered
(with the STRETCHes) I never knew, although gossip before Elizabeth and I left
New York claimed that HARVEST, the special 7030 at NSA, had a bank of them.

<p>

The May issue had several squibs on the late-news inserts about California
reaction to the Big Boom, and pictures of the funny ceramic wafers which were
the precursor of the later LSI chips; IBM had had to build a complete
super-automated facility in Fishkill [near Poughkeepsie] to make them in
enormous numbers.  And there were comments on the success of IBM secrecy.


<p>

Then in the June issue Bob Forest wrote a first assessment, and user comment -
every prospective user was a DMN reader - began to flood in.  I would have
loved to contribute, being full of the stuff and having the unique European
perspective, but although Gordon never asked me not to, I felt I had to let
others lead.  Forest was mildly upset with me.

<hr>
<p>

During the first weeks of May, while I was completely engrossed in the 360 and
its documentation, Elizabeth had been doing an apartment search.  There was
much less machinery to help her than in, say, Monte-Carlo, but what there was
she used.  And Betty Abetti helped her with the newspaper ads, although my
reviving wife was already moving into French.

<p>

She located a furnished place on the road leading down from the tiny village
of Belmont-sur-Lausanne to the locals-only rail stop called Conversion, west
of town.  The whole area has been transformed by the main autoroute today, but
that was only in planning stages in 1964.

<p>

It was the main floor of Villa Loup, and the Loups - a teacher and ex-teacher
pair, with two teenager daughters - had moved into the upper stories.  It had
a fine balcony on two sides, with vestigial furniture.  Down below M. Loup had
a big vegetable garden and a few flowers, and the stretch of land dropped away
so that a lovely view of the lake opened out over the trees at the bottom of
the property.  On the west a somewhat tree-hampered view pointed toward the
Rhone valley and especially the distant mountains.

<p>

There was a big living room with funny furniture, opening on to the lake
balcony, a small bedroom with a "marriage" bed [between double and queen] on
the east side, a very European bathroom with junior-Savoy piping and what I
told Elizabeth was an "inspection" WC: a flat interior surface that had to be
scoured off by the flood from the overhead tank.  She was more amused than put
off, and indeed it was not much more exotic than what we had at the de la
Paix.

<p>

The little kitchen had a fair stove but a tiny fridge, about three feet high
and set on the floor; you knelt down to look inside.  Later I built a stand
out of precut lumber which served as a wine cellar, and levered the little
monster up on top, but it was always inconvenient.

<p>

And Mme. Loup did our laundry, giving it a good flap in the lake breezes down
under our north porch.  She also undertook to file the proper papers with the
commune to start the residence permit request through the labyrinthine
cantonal and federal processes.  Nice!

<p>

There was a "garage" in the sous-sol, which Madame said we could use for
storage, since it was too short for the Opel (the Loups rode mopeds).  In fact
the Porsche was so compact we were able to use it nicely, and close the door
with two (!) inches to spare.

<p>

There was no TV, and only a very very Swiss radio in overweening cabinetry.
There was an extension of the Loup telephone in the interior hall, which we
used infrequently; I made long distance calls from Jordils or the downtown
post office (as in Monte-Carlo).

<p>

Elizabeth gave the Loups a deposit and two month's rent as soon as we decided
on the place, but we stayed at the de la Paix almost until the end of my six
weeks for Gordon, just in case the canton made trouble about our advent.  We
did unload the suitcase stack from our suite and my trunk from the Opel into
the Loup storage space, which made the hotel room a great deal more
comfortable.  And I sallied forth to Germany with the wagon having done yeoman
duty, knowing that the new car would not have to serve for trunk transport!

<p>

For reasons I have forgotten Elizabeth did not come to Germany with me.  I
drove to Stuttgart in one long hard day, which would not have been easy with
her along, put up at the Graf Zeppelin but in a very cheap room, and reported
at the factory reception area late next morning.  All was im ordnung; the Opel
was whisked away, the insurance papers were ready for signature, the oval
tax-free plates were already affixed - and everybody spoke American.  It was a
several-a-day affair for Porsche, but a revelation to me, having stumbled
painfully through very clumsy processes in France [faithful little Simca] and
the Netherlands [big Alfa 2600].

<p>

What I drove very proudly away in was an ivory 356SC convertible with a black
top and glorious black leather interior.  This was the last year that model
was made; there were 1965 356s made while the 911s were starting delivery, but
no more convertibles and I think no more SC engines.

<p>

Elizabeth loved it from the day she touched the wheel, in a way she had never
felt about the Arizona 190SL or my scarlet Alfa Veloce in Manhattan.  She
drove it in Switzerland and back in the United States, refused offer after
offer for it as it became a classic worth four or five times what I paid in
the Sixties [$4300 or thereabouts!], and finally totalled it in its 24th year.
And agonized!

<p>

My initial contract with my friend and client wound down, much to the relief
of his Swiss finance man, who hated my expense vouchers (tiny compared to
those of Jackson, Smith and Dowd - but he hated those too, and dared not
object).  Gordon gave me supplementary tasks, including an amusing chore
reviewing the publications of the various national companies; the German DIE
LOCHKARTE had a long and honorable history.  He took me with him to his sales
meetings and got me to pontificate about IBM and review the opportunities for
the 1107 and the forthcoming 1108 at the places I had seen in my 1962 Control
Data visits.

<p>

Parenthetically, that 1108 had indeed been announced in late July [1964].  I
still have the few press releases that filtered through to Gordon and Hans,
which were passed on to me.  It was indeed five times as fast as the
late-model 1107s, but I had already used a sub rosa figure of 5.3x in my 360
comparisons, so revisions were unnecessary.  I smile today to realize I did
not see an actual 1108 until I took over the Bureau of Standards one three
years later; I had known the announcement but not the actuality!

<p>

I was delighted with the country and with Elizabeth's happiness, and pressed
Gordon for permanent employment ? la Abetti and Flesch.  He put me off,
although we were becoming closer and closer personally.  He tried to
compensate by inviting me on almost all his forays into his favorite Lausanne
restaurant, the Grappe d'Or, often including my lovely wife, who had designs
on the big handsome guy.

<p>

I discussed it with Hans and his wife, with whom we spent many evenings.  "The
poor guy is being chewed up back in Philadelphia," said our knowing friend.
"Jackson has his own problems, and wants to go back to the States, so he isn't
helping at all."

<p>

I knew Gordon was enjoying Lausanne, and that in his Golden Boy way had made
friends with for instance the movie star William Holden, who lived with a wife
almost as hoity-toity as Gordon's in the same neighborhood.  And Don was
wiring him in to the business community, which Gordon did well in in spite of
never picking up more than a few words of French.

<p>

I've told the story in print and in Scandinavian speeches about how Gordon
tackled the problem of low sales in the national companies.  Germany, which
was run by a really good man named Otto Stitz, he left alone, but
Denmark/Sweden/Norway he fretted over.  Where Jackson or other UNIVACkers
would have set up elaborate sales meetings (and spent a small fortune
importing people from the U.S.), Gordon threw a few 1107 brochures in a
suitcase and went out on the road himself.  He planted big - outrageously big
- machines up and down the region, from sardine towns in the far reaches of
Norway to a major shop in Stockholm (running up a record bill at the
Operak?llaren in the process).

<p>

Some places he used insider information from me or from his own salesmen (and
from IBM local people whom he charmed silly).  Some places he used enormous
discounts.  In Oslo he let me point him at Nygaard, whom he signed up to do an
improved version of SIMULA for the 1108, and landed an 1107 order at the same
time.  What a salesman!

<p>

One adventure which didn't come off, and which is nowhere in the literature,
came late in the shared venture.  I remembered the crazy list of nineteen
African capitals on the back of the Jordils brochure, and suggested to my
excitable client that he could probably seed UNIVAC IIIs in every capital that
had reliable electricity.  I would make a tour like the CDC affair, I said,
visiting a whole string of countries from Algeria to Zambia, starting with one
or two where I had contacts [Kenya and Morocco, through ACM] and infiltrating
the rest, relying heavily on the concierge network and a lot of very big tips.

<p>

I would report prospects, hoping for six or seven out of say fifteen contacts.
Then Gordon, whose vice-presidency covered Africa and the Middle East, could
visit those places, with or without me, and peddle his wares.  I did not
expect most of his sales would be sound ones, but that was true of his 1107
sites in Scandinavia also.  I suggested the spring of 1965, having run a
project on African weather with help from Michelin maps and the sluggish State
and Commerce departments back in Washington.

<p>

Wasn't as crazy as it sounds.  I had found out from the Jackson/Smith
secretary, who was a slim English girl with amazing French and a nice figure,
that these were often not just typewriter or electric razor sales offices, but
were concerned with flight instruments and military gadgets from the Sperry
side of the house.  Neither Gordon nor I would have to go in stark naked, as I
had had to explore in CDC anonymity almost three years back.

<p>

Gordon broached the idea on a winter trip back to headquarters, and they came
down on him like a ton of bricks, indeed objecting to several of his 1107
discounts (and probably to SIMULA) as well.  He told me this regretfully - he
was as adventurous as I, and as anxious to explore Addis-Ababa.  And he broke
down and admitted, to my chagrin but leaving me with a warm feeling toward the
man, that he did not think he could help me much in the coming year, and was
likely to be removed himself fairly soon.

<p>

And while Flesch and Ellsworth watched in horror (Abetti seemed oblivious), a
small incursion into Jordils of conservative types from the parent corporation
and from unsympathetic national companies in Gordon's own bailiwick began.

<p>

My own situation did not seem too oppressive.  Our expenses were so low
compared to Sutton House plus R?sidence Auteuil, and the RemRand fees so
generous compared to the CDC stinginess - and those gala dinners at the Beau
Rivage so frequent - that we were in fair shape financially.  I was exploring
contacts I had made in 1962, saying that the 360 work for Sperry Rand
International was winding down.  ICT looked possible, although I would have
preferred to work with Boz Ferranti.

<p>

Meanwhile we were exploring Switzerland in our wonderful new car, which drew
admiration even in St. Moritz.  Also I would go off on two- or three-day
climbing trips, usually not very challenging and usually without (expensive)
guides.  Elizabeth would not ride a moped, but the Flesch Mercedes and
Gordon's chauffeured Citroen were useable in my absence.

<p>

Skiing was wonderful.  Elizabeth loved the elegances of the Zermatterhof and
the gorgeous blue-and-white hotel sleigh with which they collected us from
the train, and we put up at the Crystal in St. Moritz (a mistake, but the best
garage for the Porsche was across the street).

<p>

And the big new thing in my life started up.  I had read for years, in fawncy
British media and in a hundred mountain books, about the famous famous Cresta
run in St. Moritz.  Started in 1885, and drawing on first English and then
rich-Swiss members, it is a unique sport.  Truly amateur, and unlike
bobsledding not available in other resorts, the mile-long descent is in a
blue-ice trough made from December snows each year, and starts up in the
holidays, drawing minor nobility and European industrialists (and a few crazed
Americans).  You get up to eighty miles an hour at the bottom of the Cresta
Leap, with your face a few inches off the ice, as you belly-down and toe-steer
against photoelectric timing.

<p>

And in the winter of 1964/65 there was not the press of aspirants I became
familiar with later.  Notably, there were few Americans, and of those most
could not come every year and were not too anxious to join.  I paid the
Supplementary List [non-member] fees and took my first rides, under casual
tutelage and with a borrowed sled, and steel-toed boots to brake with, and a
BIG crash helmet.

<p>

What mostly counted was nerve.  Many SL riders never used up their five rides;
the first one or two are unbelievably scary.  I was as slow as a first-timer
can be - well, not really; the Duke of Kent is reported to have braked to a
standstill in the run - and took 75 seconds [in later years I ran in the high
forties].  But I had been too frightened to breath, and had to be lifted off
the sled and pounded back to aeration at the finish.  Magnificent!

<p>

I applied for membership, with a scion of the Cartier family and an executive
of the CEGB as sponsors.  Today there is a three-year wait, and most Americans
never make it: I was accepted in 1965 almost as soon as we got back to
Belmont.

<p>

Made me - indeed, Elizabeth too - feel like a real European.  It gave us
status in toney St. Moritz, where Cresta riders were far more special (and
less frequent) than skiers.  We learned to stay at the Steffani (the Olivettis
and the Siemenses stayed at the Palace, and the rich English like Chips
Cartier at the Kulm).  You rode in the morning when the run was hard, and
lunched al fresco at the Sunny Bar of the Kulm.  And as I had related to the
guide Cipollo in Courmayeur and to my ski instructor Elias Julen in Zermatt,
so I got to know the Cresta clubhouse men and the Kulm bartenders.

<p>

I belonged for twenty years, and managed to ride in the Seniors Cup race at
the Centenary in 1985 (thirteenth in a huge field of oldsters), but then saw I
could never afford another trip to St. Moritz.  Felt almost like resigning
from the Astronomical Society after 35 years, which I had done in the
Seventies!

<p>

As 1965 spun on its axis, the Sperry Rand connection grew less rewarding.
Ellsworth left, Abetti seemed never to be around, Flesch fought with his
vigorous wife Huguette.  Without a travel record I can only vaguely remember
attempts to sign up other clients.  It was a time of change; with Grace and
Deo gone, we could never go back to the remarkable New York marriage.

<p>

Neither of us was yet inclined to wander, although we had begun to interact
with an older-student crowd at the de la Paix bar with attractive
opportunities for each of us.  We met strange ex-pats: the Crane family,
centered on an heir to the Chicago plumbing fortune who had lost his patrimony
in the South Seas [yes!], a cartoonist for ROAD AND TRACK named Stan Mott who
found my wife's lovely figure irresistible, a local wench who owned a charming
Italian greyhound given her by her, ah, patron which Elizabeth and I loved to
dog-sit.

<p>

One early-spring evening the hall telephone rang.  From nine time zones away,
a quiet voice began a long and very strange - and exciting - story.  I had
cast more bread on the waters than I knew, and a slice of life I had never
dreamed would ever float back, had done so.  I was asked to come to California
for an interview, expenses guaranteed - and amazingly, it was Generous
Electric!!

<p>

So I started the air log up again.  And the first entries are a Swissair
Caravelle Geneva-Copenhagen, a Scandinavian transpolar DC8 (still via Sondre
Stromfjord) to Los Angeles, and a Pacific Fairchild F5 to Santa Barbara, all
on March 24, 1965: 6400 miles.

<p>

It was 22 months since I had abandoned my first overseas venture by flying
back to Manhattan from Nice.  Although I did not yet know it, on April 4th I
would finish my second, and start a new New Life in Sixties California.

That was Santa Barbara in 1965.  The climate was wonderful - and still is,
free of the Los Angeles smog and freeway traffic.  It was and is a major
retirement community for the rich, fancier than La Jolla and less flashy than
Rat Pack Palm Springs.  And this was years before Ronnie Reagan's place up in
the hills behind the town was talked about.

<p>

Generous Electric put me up at the Santa Barbara Inn, not nearly as expensive
as the Santa Barbara Biltmore, which was probably full, but with a great deal
more action.  In fact, my host apologized for the scenes spilling out from the
crowded bar as we stood at the desk, not yet realizing how much I looked
forward to participating.

<p>

This was John C. Fisher, a long-term and very loyal GE employee who when he
was dumped years later by the no-longer-generous company became Chief
Scientist of the Air Force.  He reported in a clumsy and non-Smiddy-like
organization to Tom Paine, general manager of the local enterprise with which
I was interviewing.

<p>

This had recently been renamed Technical Military Planning Operation, TEMPO
for short, and was regarded by its proponents and denizens as a department of
the original military electronics division once headed by George Haller.  The
civilian counterpart division, no longer headed by my nemesis Harold
Strickland, still existed under a new name and contained the curious mix of
departments into which the Phoenix Computer Department had transmigrated (I
will come back to those struggling outfits in the next chapter).  Its
detractors - and both TEMPO and Paine had many, inside and outside GE -
preferred to look on it as a carbuncular super-section, somewhat like Barney
Oldfield's microwave lab had been regarded in 1956, citing the term Operation
as evidence.

<p>

I was to pick up gossip later (TEMPO was rife with it, unlike the
LaPierre/Parker/Neumann jet engine businesses) that the establishment had been
invented to shelter a number of high-level techies that had topped out the
supposedly parallel ladder of advancement in the Cordiner/Borch company, for
whom no senior staff job [Vice Prez of Engineering, say] was available.  The
one I knew was Dick Raymond, who had been Paine's predecessor and had wiggled
back into a staff position in the East.

<p>

Raymond and others had conceived of a for-profit version of RAND, sheltered
and made more attractive by the giant General Electric.  Indeed, RAND had been
spun off from Douglas in the late Forties, and most casual observers thought
Douglas now much regretted not having kept it.  Just as Cochran's department
back in Evendale had had an overgrown engineering aspect, so TEMPO had a
swollen marketing function, since the business of finding [or generating] and
bidding on Pentagon and NASA business, and extending it into continuing
contracts, was more important than the analysis and synthesis to be provided.

<p>

There are hundreds of such organizations today, and dozens of government
departments and hundreds of civilian customers.  The emphasis on generating
rather than executing business has not changed.

<p>

Fisher took me in to meet Paine, in whom I instantly saw another Robbie
(albeit with a military rather than an economic background).  Then he
introduced me to the Thompson DEACON team and we got down to business.

<p>

In Chapter 22 I described how I had brought Fred Thompson and his crew into
GE, supported their model-building and other TEMPO-like work for Fort
Huachuca, and left them to Oldfield's tender mercies when I went back to IBM.
Fred had changed - well, expanded - his interests, found his way out of the
civilian and into the military part of the GE organization, and during that
transition had become an important figure in computational linguistics.

<p>

He had a new bunch of disciples, considerable financial support from the Rome
Air Development Center [that's Rome in upstate New York], and was operating
his DEACON Project in TEMPO.  He found Paine and the TEMPO tempo
undistinguished, had clashed with the marketing people and John Fisher about
how to handle the RADC support, and ended up by resigning contemptuously.

<p>

This sat poorly with the Air Force, which regarded Fred highly and could not
conceive of supporting the work without him.  The whole project was in his
bulging cranium.  The computing and linguistic people on his crew thought the
world of him.  For a while things staggered on; Paine was conciliatory.  But
Fred had put out feelers during the interregnum, and in the late winter was
offered a tenured professorship at Cal Tech.

<p>

There was nothing Fisher or Paine could do to keep him.  And when they
suggested replacements, they found most of the possibilities in a then rather
narrow discipline were either non-citizens, unwilling to come to industry
(even in lovely Santa Barbara), or unacceptable to Fred and his gang.  Time
was running out, and RADC was unhappy.

<p>

Fisher, who was a rather nice if somewhat wimpish guy and sympathetic with the
academic atmosphere, asked Fred to suggest someone who would be acceptable to
RADC, not make the higher brows on the small DEACON team twitch, and could
work in General Electric.  Fred said he knew just the man!!

<p>

They ran me down via the ACM staff.  Neither Fred nor John were members, but
Fred had stayed in touch with Mike Seven, who had landed a nice academic job
in Pomona, and Mike was wired in via a student chapter; it was easy.  TEMPO
still had a switchboard, and lots of staff with languages.  Presto!!  Villa
Loup.

<p>

DEACON stood for Direct English Access and CONtrol, Fisher had explained, and
was a mixture of natural-language research and an implementation of Fred's
Piaget-influenced ideas about learning and about semantics.  There was a small
series of internal reports, which I found very hard to understand, since they
were written in a private jargon, leavened with paragraphs about linguistics
and systems programming.  A year later the team put out a major publication in
an AFIPS Proceedings, and this has survived in the citations world of Academe.
"Nothing beside remained ...", as Shelley said.

<p>

I was introduced to the small group, who had been warned by Fred of my
astronomical origin and my engineering career.  The computing side of the
house, which ran a dedicated GE625 with a non-GE disk stack cloned from the
IBM RAMAC, and used fairly primitive Teletype gear for most I/O, found it
acceptable; the language experts were startled..  System loads were card
decks, but the linguistic entries were hunt-and-peck TTY.

<p>

This meant that later on, when I was demonstrating our capabilities at RADC
and in the Pentagon, I could sashay up to any standard teletype and sign in in
the Balboa Building on the main drag of Santa Barbara.  Crude by 1998
networking standards, but sophisticated in 1965.

<p>

I'll come back to the people later.  I have to explain a little first about
the "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone ...": what remains of the DEACON
effort.  The intention to use natural language - fairly unrestricted English -
was foredoomed, and I was dubious from the beginning.  Hundreds of very clever
and mostly well-intentioned researchers have struggled on four continents,
from the first years of the Sixties to today, and are only slightly closer to
the goal.  I have written many times that yes, we will some day talk to our
computer as Arthur Clarke's heroes talked to HAL.  But it may take centuries.

<p>

Understand that this is not voice input; DEACON was content with keystrokes.
I have had a dictation program for six months in 1997/98, and am startled and
fascinated by its rather considerable capabilities and its obvious promise.
The Santa Barbara attempt was to parse simple English sentences input by
teletype and understand the structure, permitting hundreds of simple
variations in order and tense and gender and on and on.  The group had done
well with tense and number but had not yet tackled negation!

<p>

The second leg was the semantic one: what is the meaning of the
phrase/sentence/paragraph after you have its structure deciphered?  And here I
think Fred was on solid ground, and as we look at the PC operating systems and
the database constructs of today we see the embodiment of his idea: that each
person or team using an inquiry system (or whatever) has his or their private
set of meanings for words or strings of words, and by extension even of
numerical data.

<p>

DEACON, I came to tell audiences, was to be an electronic backpack storing the
world and the world-view of the person owning it.  Today we have laptops that
offer that sort of personalization for two or three thousand dollars; in the
mid-Sixties a team of CIA analysts would need a major chunk of a million-
dollar mainframe.

<p>

The dictionaries and linkages were stored in ring structures much like the
lists in LISP, which was a slow tool and required a lot of disk space.  My
demo sentence at RADC was, "How many red ships are in Boston harbor?"  The
structure analysis handled "how many" and which harbor, the semantic lists
chose between red equals hull color and red equals communist flag.

<p>

Incidentally, when I did everything right and the TTY and its line and the 625
back in TEMPO were all happy, DEACON would reply, "if red equals hull color 4/
if red equals communist 2".  What Paine and Fisher wanted me to disguise was
how much special parsing and how many linguistic "rules" had been tinkered up
to generate that rather glum reply.

<p>

It wasn't crooked: the team, and Fred while he was in charge, would never
never have put in a prescribed answer or otherwise faked a response.  If we
changed the ship-movement database the answers changed from 4 and 2 to new
numbers, quite honestly.  If we did "airport" or "Chicago" or "planes" (and
put those words in the rather sparse vocabulary), the parsing still worked.
If we did "Chicago harbor" but left the rest of the demo query unchanged,
DEACON would coolly inform us Chicago was not a harbor (of course it really
is, for Great Lakes shipping).

<p>

What Fred and his team, and their intellectual counterparts in Academe, had
glossed over - although you can be sure Paine saw it clearly - was how
specialized the market would be even for a highly perfected DEACON.  In the
Sixties or the Seventies it could only be applied to terrifically valuable
inquiries: those of a POTUS, or a Tom Watson (both of whom would be too
impatient to use it).  A team of intelligence analysts, say, at NSA or deep in
the bowels of the Pentagon, might be doing work so important they could afford
it; hence, RADC.  But you had to strain a little!

<p>

DEACON would never forget a fact, no matter how old or obscure.  It would
never overlook a connection it was capable of making.  It was available every
minute of the year, even during Bowl games.  Speeds a thousand times greater,
data memory a thousand times larger, were possible, with no limit in sight.
But I had guessed, even during Thompson's hypnotic presentations, that even
quite modest success would be superhumanly difficult.

<p>

Parenthetically, there are projects today that hope to input enough of, um,
the universal context to mimic common sense.  They have enormously increased
speed, incredible storage capacity - and hundreds of times as many workers as
DEACON had.  I wish them well. Perhaps when the next millenium approaches ...

<p>

Well!  Back to TEMPO!  I had a group of a dozen people, all bright, all
hard-working.  There was internal Operation politics, notably about competing
computer capabilities servicing the other local projects (and doing payroll!),
but it hardly affected the group.

<p>

The key analysts were Chris Longyear, a great vaguely-Oxbridge type, Jim
Craig, Susan Berezner, and Russ Abbott; the key systems man was a John Gwynn,
who had written most of the ring processor software.  There were support
types.  And there was a character, Homer Carney, who leavened the serious lump
but had a great deal of hard-knocks computer experience.

<p>

I hadn't enough budget to expand in the old Groschian fashion, but I captured
a great woman named Mandalay Grems, who had done most of BACAIC for Randy
Porter at Boeing back in the 701/704/SHARE days, and a couple of youngsters.
And toward the end of my stay I managed a link to Madeline Henderson, who as
Madeline Berry had been a member of the Perry/Berry/Kent information retrieval
team at MIT and then Western Reserve, which team because of Jim Perry's
chemistry origins had been the "customer" for Pete Luhn's IBM search engine a
decade earlier.

<p>

I will return to the project further on.  But now I must get into personal
mode, as I accommodated to glorious Santa Barbara.  It had been years - and it
seemed like decades - since I had been immersed in the California Culture, so
different from Europe in general and Calvinist French Switzerland in
particular.  Santa Barbara was not as crazy as Sunset Tower West just beyond
Hollywood had been, but the sexy action at the motels and restaurants in my
new town was still pretty enticing.  And these were the Roaring Sixties, with
the climax year 1968 coming up fast.

<p>

I did the usual car rental (a white Mustang convertible) leasing it by the
month as a poor substitute for my wonderful 356SC.  I moved out of the Inn
into a cute tiny one-bedroom house on the fringes of Montecito, which was the
pride and joy of an older woman who had family affairs to attend to back East;
reminded me of the way Dorothy and I had rented the house of the BU professor
on sabbatical back at WHIRLWIND.

<p>

The big question mark was Elizabeth.  She had made it clear as I packed for
TEMPO that she had no intention of moving back to the horrid U.S.A. and
certainly not to paradigmatic California.  I sympathized; much much preferred
Europe myself.  But I had failed to stake out a connection with Ferranti or
Siemens, and the happy linkage to Gordon was personal and not to Sperry Rand.
That had dwindled as he and Dowd prepared to return to muggly Blue Bell, and I
saw no financial or intellectual extension possible.  So TEMPO looked terrific
- but not to my lovely but intransigent spouse.

<p>

"Send CARE packages!" was her approximate valedictory.  And she intended to
enjoy the Porsche; her letters were dismissive of "that other" convertible.

<p>

I cast out grappling irons: the Sport Car Club of America, to which I still
belonged (big in Montecito), swingers' organizations, my old connections from
beef-bones-at-the-Cock-and-Bull days.  Jack Strong with his infinite supply of
interesting women was only a hundred miles away.

<p>

Soon I was enmeshed with a handsome woman from TEMPO, who as travel executive
secretary was handling my trips to upstate New York and to a myriad computer
conferences (notably the next IFIP conference, which was to displace the 1965
Spring Joint in Manhattan and which was a chance for me to recontact my dozens
of valued European friends I had cavalierly abandoned).  She was divorced; had
two attractive blond sons with whose upbringing she was struggling.  She saw
the TEMPO intellectuals and power types as she ferried them to far climes like
Yemen and Schenectady, and wanted her youngsters to have such opportunities.

<p>

Her name was Joyce Winn, and the boys were Wyman Winn [12] and Wally Winn [8].
Her maiden name had been Labots-Misbeek, of Dutch provenance.  Walt Senior
lived across town, contributed to support of his sons, and took them huntin'
and fishin' - which was not going to get them into Stanford!  She was twelve
years younger than I, vivacious (sportif, my Lausanne friends would have
said).  She was supporting the boys and a small house "on the mesa", and a
simple and not too new Ford Falcon.  It wasn't easy.

<p>

She had few dates in spite of her attractions, mostly because her "young men"
deterred serious types, and she was wary of one-night-stands.  I was at least
a continuing romance, although she was aware (from me directly, and from the
TEMPO girly network) that I had a wife back in Switzerland.

<p>

To facilitate what was transmuting into a courtship, I signed up for a
fantastic sport car - in many ways the handsomest and head-turningest car I
ever owned.  I bought it in Los Angeles: a Jaguar XKE roadster, metallic dark
gray [ah, grey!] with a black top and crimson leather interior.  Oooooh!

<p>

 It was the last year to have the "smooth" headlights, and the first year to
have an improved transmission [ah, gearbox!] and seat design.  Magnificent;
the boys were crazy about it, and Joyce said it was the sexiest thing she had
ever ridden in - let alone driven!  And it wasn't just looks; with sticky
road-racing tires it cornered in the winding roads up above Santa Barbara even
better than my two Alfas ever had.

<p>

It also created a stir at the regional Porsche Owners Club meeting, which I
attended as the certified owner of, ahem, "my Swiss 356SC".

<p>

Limited maintenance was available at the Buick dealer in SB.  I would leave
the Jag to have the minor repairs such cars always seem to need, walk three
blocks to the Balboa Building where my group worked, and pick it up in the
evening for the short drive to Montecito.

<p>

Joyce and the boys were friends with several men and couples into racing,
mostly at Willow Springs near Lancaster, and I was drawn into that circle.
The Jag, the Porsche, my long list of great cars paraded faithfully by Wally
and Wyman, and my membership in the SCCA all helped.  Soon I bought a 1958
Porsche Speedster with a roller crank racing engine, stripped down and
roll-barred for the track., and had it trailered to the Lancaster pits for
practice.

<p>

Sad story!  I missed the ninth turn at Willow on my very first excursion,
rolled half a dozen times out in the sagebrush, and totalled the little
monster.  I still carry a photo of the crumpled car, signallizing what
ambition out of proportion to ability can do.  I was not too old, and
Hollywood types like Paul Newman drive well at more advanced ages.  I was
fairly reflexive on the Cresta.  But at Willow Springs, no!!  There were
race-driver training courses, but they were too remote or already full; I went
out and tigered, and crashed.

<p>

I mentioned in connection with GE management philosophy [Chapter 16] that
Paine had had me shipped back from the Lancaster hospital in an exceedingly
comfortable ambulance.  Clustered at the Santa Barbara bedside were not only
the Winn family and my DEACON gang, but Fisher - fearful for that RADC
funding.  He notified Elizabeth, telling her it was just broken ribs and a few
teeth, but she nevertheless hopped on Swissair and joined the throng.  Problem
was, living alone in my little house and with a low bedstead, I couldn't roll
out of bed without help - and Santa Barbara, full of retirees, was for the
moment out of motorized invalid beds!  So I was in hospital for a couple of
weeks.

<p>

Today's HMOs would have rebelled, but 1965 GE medical coverage did not flinch.

<p>

Elizabeth took one look at lively young Joyce and saw she and I had a problem.
She struggled on in Switzerland for some months, failing in repeated attempts
to get private-school teaching jobs in spite of her obvious talent and
increasingly fluent French.  In the end, as my reluctance to finance her
continuing residence became apparent, she flew to Las Vegas (which she hated,
hated) and filed for divorce.  I split our holdings, giving her the Porsche,
paid not only for the stay in Vegas and the legal shenanigans but to have her
belongings in Belmont and New York City shipped to Phoenix, and tried with
much guilt to settle her back into the U.S.

<p>

I agreed to a terminating (five-year) alimony arrangement, which was supposed
to get her back into the self-supporting mode from which I had plucked her
nine years before. But with no Aunt Grace to steer her, and the social
distractions of her earlier Scottsdale connections, it didn't work very well.
She joined the third-rate faculty at Judson School, whose property had
adjoined ours on Mummy Mountain, and did quite well with the rich Hollywood
kids who were sequestered there, but it never really came to much.  Her
public-school credentials from Ohio were out of date, and Phoenix was
oversupplied with people who wanted to move there from the
rain/snow/mud-bedeviled East.

<p>

Guilt, indeed.  I wanted to marry my new love, and found her young sons a plus
rather than a minus.  I thought Santa Barbara was terrific, and Joyce was a
real born-in-town link to many of its attractions.  She intended to keep on
working (although not at GE if we married, she said), so the drain of the
divorce on my finances would be mitigated.  But I shouldn't have done it.

<p>

Problem was that D?odat and Grace had been the glue that held the Elizabeth
marriage together, in spite of the divisive forces of my travels and my
extrusion from IBM.  When we decamped to Europe it eased the pain of their
absence, but the union between the survivors was weakened.  If I could have
eased into Sperry Rand and truly settled in Lausanne, or if ICT had hired me
in London, or Ferranti in Manchester, that union would have knit again.

<p>

I was right to jump at the TEMPO job, which drew me back into the mainstream,
into the important years at the Bureau of Standards, and made the later ACM
presidency possible.  Nevertheless, much as I loved and still love Joyce, the
divorce was a Bad Thing.  In today's evolved world, I could move in with my
new love, raise her handsome boys, and send Elizabeth her CARE packages; that
was not possible in 1965 Santa Barbara or with 1965 Joyce - nor with 1999
Joyce, probably!

<p>

It is notable that two really destructive decisions in my, um, unusual life
have followed new love affairs.  There are proverbs: I will not quote them.

<p>

While the painful personal struggles kept me on tenterhooks, DEACON was
evolving.  Gwynn made considerable progress not only in massaging the ring
processor, but in describing it in TEMPO reports for our sponsors back East.
Longyear was beginning to wire me in to the computational linguistics
community, whose special skills were still beyond me but whose jargon I had
begun to acquire.  Craig and the youngsters were adding grammar rules at a
fair rate.  And on the managerial front, I was beginning to settle in.

<p>

This, in two senses.  Out in the world, I was learning to work with grant
money, an unfamiliar venue, and with the key people who supervised its
expenditure, At RADC this was a Col. Florence Casey (leaf, as I remember; not
eagle); she came out to see us and mutter at our slow progress.

<p>

On occasion I would go back east, sometimes to visit RADC but also to racket
around the DDRE precinct of the Pentagon, which was a couple of levels up in
the food chain.  There I dealt mostly with a vigorous and less pleasant type
named Dr. Ruth Davis, who claimed unlike Casey to understand what Thompson had
promised to do.  I resisted gently, since her view - in my view - would take
decades to accomplish, and most of her rather large budget.

<p>

One of my genuine skills, honed in the jet engine years, was walk-through.  I
could pretty well sense what was going well and what was foundering, as I
talked to my youngsters and their clients.  Out in the shop, not in my office
- and I couldn't do it very well with strangers.

<p>

As I got to know and respect the DEACON bunch I began to regain this ability.
It told me that we were only at the beginning of the beginning of the task:
notably, it had me note that whenever a new "rule" was implemented (several a
day, but not dozens or hundreds), many and sometimes very many of the
previously-working rules had to be, ah, upgraded.  "That's the way language
works", said Chris, and I agreed.  But as Casey pointed out, it looked like
many thousands of rules would be needed to parse even a small subset of
English.

<p>

I shared my misgivings with the crew, gently, and with Fisher.  That latter
was undoubtedly a mistake, as he in turn warned Paine that I thought the
project was in trouble.  I had succeeded in getting the next stage of funding,
$850,000, through the RADC and DDRE channels - child's play compared to
bucking General Medaris!  But if 1966/67 was safe, what about 1967/68?

<p>

While this descent into realism progressed, I was also wriggling in
post-Smiddy General Electric politics.  Not the TEMPO stuff, which was minor:
who should control other computing activities such as LP work and simulations,
where I was viewed warily by the guys in charge, but the Big Screen problems
screaming for solution over in the computer parts of the Industrial and
Information Group.  Paine offered them internal consulting services, partly
because TEMPO had genuine capabilities, especially now I was aboard, but also
to get his Operation further up the organizational ladder in the giant
company.

<p>

Here he nibbled from below at the staff outfits (much diminished in force
after Smiddy's retirement), which were supposed to do similar assessments
company-wide, and mostly gratis (which Paine could not do), but which so far
had done little to reduce the what-next-after-ERMA pangs of the computer
departments.

<p>

Some maddened amateur had allowed GE to buy Machines Bull in Paris and the
Borgolombardo efforts of Olivetti.  I could have really really helped in the
matter: could have told them how utterly impossible assimilating the two
cultures into Generous Electric would be.  Schenectady and 570 Lexington
hadn't been able to cope with Phoenix, let alone Avenue Gambetta!

<p>

But not only did these fatheads not know I had ever existed, or how successful
Evendale had been, but they hadn't known enough to draw on the knowledge of
men like Bob Johnson, who had carried ERMA to its amazing conclusion.  Bob
didn't know much about Europe, but he knew a great deal about computers in
general, and the rigidities of the professional-managers-can-manage-anything
GE philosophy.  In fact, I soon discovered he had escaped from the morass and
gone over to begin a major career in Burroughs.

<p>

I hope some day we will find out how those decisions were reached.  We are
finally hearing how things went in secretive Watsonian IBM, and about the
weird birthpains of the GE Computer Department.  The book on the Bull and
Olivetti purchases is still sealed.  In blood!

<p>

Fisher had done a competent job on my early GE adventures, even talking to my
old boss Dave Cochran, by then ensconced in Washington.  He had ignored the
evil reports from Phoenix, which were diminished by the departures of Oldfield
and Lasher some years back, and by the disappearance into the organizational
cellar of all the other partisans.  He had only heard of the reorganizations
and international adventures of the successor managers third-hand, and through
the ridiculous optimism of the GE Annual Report.  We had mumbled over our
copies of the proprietary [looseleaf !] organization manual and tried to see
whom I could talk to - or more precisely, whom Paine might sell my consulting
services to.  There were literally a hundred organizational possibilities, but
the slots were occupied by strange names except at the very top.  I suggested
to Fisher he start there and work down.

<p>

This is a good place to list the culprits, victims, and in overwhelming
majority ignoramuses, of the 1965/66 GE information technology kingdom.  The
300,000-person company (yes, Marion Kellogg was still listed!) was still
divided into staff areas and five groups, plus a sixth international group
which would give me fits in a few months.  All these were headed by two-star
vice presidents , and under them were major divisions usually headed by
one-star VPs like my hero Gerhard Neumann.  Most of the domestic and highly
interwoven computer departments were under an Information Systems Division,
quite properly named, undoubtedly at the insistence of its new and exceedingly
knowledgeable boss Lou Rader.

<p>

Yes, Lou!  Some hint of what it must have taken to persuade him to come back
to GE was to be found in his location: division headquarters was in
Charlottesville!  An important deputy, Jerry Coe, was at 570, and ran a
three-person shop called Data Processing and Communications [communications
with Lou, one presumes!].

<p>

The telephone guys were in Lynchburg.  Specialty Controls, Lou's old
department, was still in Waynesboro.  There was a process control outfit,
recently centered in Phoenix.  They had left the semiconductor manufacturing
in Syracuse, but put it under ISD.  And somebody had scooped up the old
Instrument Department, still in West Lynn.  These were all characterized by
having "real" manufacturing sections - that is, a product.  In that vein there
was a Specialty Equipment set-up in Phoenix which I assumed was still doing
ERMA or ERMA parts.

<p>

Then we found a gaggle of special operations, banned by the old Smiddy
philosophy.  Jerry Coe's was one, and there was a coordinating group under Lou
Wengert at the same deputy level in Phoenix, and one in Syracuse under Len
Maier, who was also building a real-product outfit in Oklahoma City.

<p>

There was a planning group for the division in Charlottesville under Bob
Curry, whom I knew slightly and whom I think Rader brought from Univac, and an
Information Systems Marketing Operation under a poor type named Vern Cooper,
in Phoenix, which competed with Curry.  This Phoenix office was where the
sales force reported, rather than in the product department - shades of IBM!

<p>

There was a listing for an internal automation operation in Schenectady, which
also sounded like a Rader insistence, and amazingly, Jordan Baruch, a Genuine
User, running his Medinet (with a software section) which some crazed soul had
bought that very year for Generous Electric but left in Boston.

<p>

There were the usual legal eagles, and a retirement spot for Ed Parker, who
had helped me back in the 701 days in Evendale, and had been a major bridge to
Baker.

<p>

They had set up a Field Engineering Operation working out of Phoenix, which
made sense, and there was what would some years later be called GEISCO:
centers in Huntsville (sob!) and Cleveland and Chicago but headquartered out
of Bethesda, as it is today.  I see now, although I don't remember noticing it
with Fisher, that there was a center at Dartmouth, where GE was having one of
its painfully few successes.

<p>

Now, about the key activity: they had created a Computer Equipment Department
- the main one, signalled by a patent section - out on Black Canyon in
Phoenix, and Fisher said I should see it: a real GE plant with all the bells
and whistles, churning out 600-series mainframes.

<p>

The manager was a completely new name to me, for all my DATAMATION
note-taking.  I went to the TEMPO library, which was at section level,
elegantly labeled Technical Information Operation, and to my delight found it
headed by one of my Evendalers, Klaus Liebhold.  Not only was he still a
friend, but he and his family still had my lovely milk-chocolate-brown poodle
Carole, whom I had given them in Ohio after Dorothy's death!!

<p>

The dear creature was a little gray around the muzzle, and of course didn't
remember me at all - but it was wonderful to see her, and realize how happy
the intervening decade must have been for her.

<p>

Klaus tried to get back issues of the organization manual and position
announcements, but there seemed to be no way in 1965 [how different a Web
search would be today!] to find out where this mysterious character had
appeared from.  His name was Erwin Koeritz, and he disappeared a couple of
years later just as unobtrusively as he had emerged.  He didn't belong to any
of the pertinent professional societies.

<p>

This seemed to be the pattern in the lower reaches also.  I was amazed to
discover there was no engineering section, although one of the poor simps who
had lived in the college building in 1957 had survived and was running a
peripheral equipment operation responsible for hardware integration; the stuff
was bought or made outside.  His old boss Ken Geiser had disappeared but was
still in Phoenix, his great wife having so embedded herself in the community
that Ken would not leave.  Good for him, I thought.

<p>

The one man I could relate to was John Weil, who was a Real Figure in the
professional and user-community circles I had inhabited for so many years.
He had been at GE San Jose, somewhat as a successor to Dick Stark (who had
decamped to Academe).  This was the sort of engineer/scientist the
departments, division and group needed so very badly (and seemed to have so
few of).  My guess is that Rader had drawn him in.  He had a means-anything
title: Manager, Systems and Processor Operation.

<p>

There was absolutely no other trace of software.  Bob Bemer had not yet
arrived on the scene.  Great stuff was rumored to be coming out of Dartmouth,
but I heard this first via gossip at the New York IFIP meeting; Fisher didn't
know, and if Gwynn had heard it was probably through UCSB, the fancy campus of
the University of California five miles west of us.

<p>

One problem with the higher organizational status of all these activities was
that it drew wannabees in a way that the feeble Phoenix show had not done in
ERMA times.  Few of them had ever shared the computer excitement - Weil was an
exception - but they all had studied management!  And enough of the Smiddy
philosophy survived in Fred Borch's GE to let these unknowledgeable types
clamber up the ladder.

<p>

LaPierre had retired.  Jack Parker ran our group, and Gerry Neumann a huge
division under him.  And TEMPO was part of a Washington-oriented division run
by a Berkeley Davis, whom I knew nothing about.  Rader reported up through a
different group, unfortunately - to a guy named Hersh Cross, who in today's
parlance would be called "part of the problem"!

<p>

While Fisher was noodling around through these multifarious channels and
reaching up towards Cross, I tried to work directly on Rader, with whom I
still had some standing.  One problem was geographical; he stayed huddled in
lovely Charlottesville, and I was not as free as I had been in Evendale to
just saunter in on him!

<p>

A curious note is that absolutely none of these outfits sent representatives
to the triennial IFIP conference at the New York Hilton.  Rader himself would
have been a welcome keynoter, for instance, to balance out Snow White IBM and
the other six of the Seven Dwarfs.  He had been featured at a banker bash
earlier in the year, which reflected ERMA rather than MAC and such.

<p>

I don't propose to tell much about that IFIP meeting, which was given advance
space in the May issue of DATAMATION, and reported fairly well in July.  It
had displaced the regular Spring Joint, and had a label which soon
disappeared: IFIP Congress 1965 INTERDATA.  I had barely arrived in Santa
Barbara, and in fact I seem to remember telling Fisher on the interview trip
that attendance would be an important part of the relocation deal.

<p>

I flew United into Kennedy [JFK; no longer IDL!] on 18 May, and out of Newark
on the 26th. Although neither the Joints nor IFIP65 strained the New York
hotel scene in the way that the giant Seventies NCCs were to do, I took the
precaution of putting up at the Gotham, wistfully remembering the long stay
when I came to De Carlo at the beginning of 1958.

<p>

There were three or four thousand Americans and eight hundred foreigners, and
a major chasm between interest in the exhibits and stupid stuff about ALGOL60.
But the attractions of Manhattan for me lay elsewhere.  I had been gone less
than two years, but it was and is a cityscape that changes and changes.

<p>

I was approached by Paul Armer, glad to see me back from overseas, to be
backup speaker at a great ACM/DCA bash being arranged in Los Angeles to
feature Ershov, the Novosibirsk king of Soviet software, who had arrived
imbedded in a glum cluster that had run into travel restrictions at both ends.
"If he shows you can sit next to him," said Paul, "and if they won't let him
out of New York, you can tell us about Europe."  In the end he came, and was
dreadful.  But the sight of a real live Soviet computer professional made up
for it.

<p>

The report in DMN is good about the very first stirrings of ARPA, and reports
early sessions on standards and on patents.  I was too dazed by my unexpected
transformation to remember much about any of the stuff, but clearly the lump
of we-must-put-in-this-paper-from-Nigeria IFIPerries was leavened by Joint
concerns.  It is fair to say that the visitors thought it was a great meeting,
and that the Americans remembered Paris!

<p>

Many of my old European friends and 1962 acquaintances were amazed that I was
living in the U.S. again - in fact, many of them had thought I was still
soloing in Monte-Carlo, not having heard of my adventures with Gordon and the
360.  They all seemed to think it was quite natural, not realizing I would
have preferred the U.K. or the continent.  Those who knew her were concerned
about Elizabeth, stranded [as they thought] in French Switzerland.

<p>

I cannot remember whether SHARE founders other than Armer showed up; most of
them were decidedly not internationalists, and indeed guys like Jack Strong
hated to even come to Manhattan.  But as I said above, I was dazed by my new,
ahem, opportunities.

<p>

Well!  Jumping back to DEACON and to autumn in Santa Barbara, I had begun
demonstrating what the team had produced not only at RADC and at the Pentagon,
but internally in GE.  This was to introduce the activity to the steadily
growing community of users in the giant company, a community which was being
held back by Rader's gentle admonitions at the divisional level from ordering
360s.  I found it hard to recommend the 600 series, partly because I still had
major reservations about Phoenix but also because I had great difficulty in
finding out much about it.  Shades of Burroughs!

<p>

On the personal front, Elizabeth had finished her horrid confinement in Nevada
and the divorce action was imminent.  I had had to leave the charming little
house in Montecito when the owner reclaimed it, and was a resident of a very
dull motel.  But I spent almost all my private time with Joyce and her boys,
and planned to move in with them after marriage and honeymoon.  In
preparation, lovely sister poodles named Minnie and Suzie and a kitten Wyman
and Wallie had rescued had already begun to swell the ranks, and a Siamese was
under consideration.

<p>

Joyce and I were married at Christmas.  The boys were pleased.  I moved my
last possessions into the mesa house, loaded Joyce onto a Scandinavian
transpolar (she resisted first-class, thinking of "our" alimony payments), and
again went honeymooning.  We did New Year's Eve in Copenhagen.

<p>

We spent five pleasant days in London, flew down to Zurich, rented a car (the
Porsche had been shipped to Elizabeth), and enjoyed wintry St. Moritz and the
Cresta crowd.  Judging Joyce's preferences, and concern about comparisons with
Elizabeth, I put us up at the Crystal rather than the Steffani.

<p>

I wanted to show my lovely new wife all the things I enjoyed, hoping perhaps
to live with her in Europe some day.  It was a mistake.  Honeymoons are for
brides, not grooms.  We should have gone to Hawaii.

<p>

When I married Nancy years later, and honeymooned in the Far East, I made very
very sure she wanted to do it.  In fact, we even talked about Hawaii as a
first stop!

<p>

Joyce and I flew back to Kennedy on Swissair, which she liked, and connected
to TWA for Los Angeles.  We were met at LAX - the boys were ecstatic - and
driven up to Santa Barbara to begin an exciting marriage.

<p>

I pass over the next months of struggle with both DEACON and TEMPO.  The group
did well, notably by getting a big bundle of material ready for presentation
at and publication through an AFIPS conference.  I got Fred Thompson to start
off the session, partly because it was his due and the youngsters approved,
but also because I was more than a little dubious about fielding questions
from the linguistics people in the audience if I did it!

<p>

Fisher's inquiries at the group and divisional levels began to bear fruit (I
should mention that I got nowhere with Rader, my proposals probably being
blocked by Bob Curry).  John had found considerable concern over the European
operations, which were being fumbled over by the second or third Professional
Manager shipped over by 570 Lex and the International group.  It wasn't just
cash flow, or orders: Cross quite rightly had the feeling he wasn't getting
the Full Monty.

<p>

It ended up by Paine authorizing the two of us to make a major tour of the
Bull and Italian venues, and report to Hersh Cross quietly on what we found.
I should begin by saying the whole thing was a fiasco, and was cut short as
the machinations to sell the whole crazy GE shebang, from Phoenix to
Borgolombardo, to inept Honeywell, began to climax.

<p>

But the big shots carefully didn't tell us, and I had not noticed the very
faint whispers in the trade that the goings-on were going on.  We packed our
suitcases and went.

<p>

This was 19 October 1966.  Joyce's successor as travel provider did not do too
well by us, and we were somewhat crumpled as we emerged from Alitalia at
Malpensa, to be met by a big crew of ex-Olivettians pretending to be GEers.
The key figure was one Ottarino Beltrami, whom I had never met; Roberto
Olivetti, whom I had hoped to see again, and who was on the board of directors
of Olivetti-General Electric s.P.a. along with Rader and financial guys,
stayed away.

<p>

Beltrami was backed up by Sacerdoti, whom I did know from IFIP connections.
Both were nice to Fisher but cautious with me - word had been passed!  None of
the Canadians I remembered from 1962 showed up .  We got a tour of the Milan
facilities (which I literally don't remember), a long and unconvincing
market-futures exposition, but nothing much about finances.  That annoyed
Fisher, who had boned up on the official figures back at the ranch, but
relieved me; I wouldn't have believed even the decimal place.  I wanted to go
up to Ivrea and see some production and read some shipping tags; out of the
question, said Beltrami.  "We have the whole story for you here in Milano!"

<p>

But wow! did I ever enjoy the meals.  They laid it on.  John was somewhat
repelled, being a simple eater back in the Oo Ess.
 
I told John what we ought to do was to sneak back and interview a few GE-115
customers, which I knew Vacca and Ercoli could turn up for me.  Take too long,
he said, wincing (he knew I meant I didn't believe the yarns that had been
spun).  I figured I could do it by telephone and regular mail after we got
back to SB, but that of course never happened.  How much we would have
benefited from today's e- mail!

<p>

The big crimes were up north, anyhow.  Bull was hurting, and there was a GE
guy to beat on at 94 avenue Gambetta: a disaster named Brainard Fancher.  I
didn't want to do Paris right away and John was coming around to my "talk to
customers" routine, so we got ourselves rerouted to one of the national
companies under Bull-GE, and went out to a major 625 installation at ASEA in
Sweden.  This was at V?ster?s, northwest of Stockholm.  Forecasting a
later merger, I called ASEA "the Brown-Boveri of Sweden" - there were
undoubtedly links to GE, but neither John nor the various GE information
sources confirmed it.

<p>

Here I was in my element, and relieved to have Fisher see me perform.  I
talked about time-sharing, and DEACON, and the European scene, and had a great
time.  The ASEA people were keen on the 625 and unhappy with IBM Stockholm.  I
pricked up my ears when I heard some disparagement of the GE crowd at
[Swedish] headquarters, where we were due the next day.

<p>

John and I reluctantly were chauffeured off to the big city.  We had been told
to join the company celebration - it was not the weekend, but I no longer
remember if there was a holiday or some special Bull-GE date - at a moored
party boat in Stockholm harbor.  Decanted, we struggled with our suitcases up
the gangplank into a mass of handsome male and female Swedes whooping it
up. Dozens of 'em!

<p>

We asked for the GE party and were told "we have the whole boat!!"  John was
flabbergasted.  I was more accustomed to European style, and told him there
were not only wives and husbands, but customers and their wives, and
prospects, and probably the general manager's mother and father.  Didn't help;
he couldn't get past the fact that the one 625 and a handful of small Gammas
[55s] were all the office had going..  It was the low point of the whole trip
for him.

<p>

Paris did not restore him.  Fancher was huddled in a dumb office surrounded by
a hundred hostile Frenchpersons, and had not prepared any kind of show for us
- mostly wanted to talk about GE "back home", and Phoenix.  Oh, how I would
have enjoyed his wonderful job - and how he hated it!

<p>

When we got back to California Fisher did the report, saying I had to catch up
on my DEACON responsibilities.  I don't have a copy any more, but remember how
circumspect he was about the individuals.  My view, as will have become
obvious to readers much earlier, is that it is people who count: a Neumann, a
Watson, a Robinson, a Fancher, an Oldfield.  The beancounters ignored 'em, and
Fisher was content-conscious: project descriptions and Gannt charts and
technical audits.  But he did not disguise his misgivings, and the
beancounters were not much persuaded either.  My animadversions were not
needed.

<p>

The document disappeared into 570 and Charlottesville.  I tried to get up a
solo trip in February, more like my 1962 CDC tour, and using Rader as an
excuse rather than Cross, but had hardly set foot on European soil than Paine
called me back.  The transfer to Honeywell was about to start, and he was
afraid to get stuck with the cost of a survey if the sponsor evaporated.  Ugly
scene.

<p>

I did not fit well at TEMPO.  Part of it was that Paine was a C-E-I-R type:
promise anything.  Partly it was that I was so mouthy about how GE was again
throwing away a terrific opportunity to scare IBM spitless and maybe inch
Sperry Univac out of the Number Two slot.  And this was inevitably reflected
in tensions in my new marriage.  Being pro-European in a very American
paradise was contributing.

<p>

Paine was afraid I would do something unfortunate with DEACON.  He and Fisher
were sort of hinting I ought to talk to Rader (who as far as I could see
wanted no Grosches around as he struggled in the selloff maelstrom).

<p>

Then, in a version of the skies opening when I was drafted out of Forrester's
WHIRLWIND to set up Evendale, an old friend/enemy emerged from the jungle.
Cuthbert Hurd had left IBM, where he had done so wonderfully in starting and
running Applied Science but had later been crippled by the STRETCH
disappointments (which gave the beancounters leverage over the computernicks).
He was now chairman of a great software/applications house called Computer
Usage Corporation.  And because of his extraordinary contacts in every corner
of U.S. computerdom, he had been appointed head of the search committee to
find a director for the foundering Center for Computer Sciences and
Technology, established at the new National Bureau of Standards site in
Gaithersburg.

<p>

He and his adjuncts had scoured every computing barrel in the country.  Nobody
wanted the job, which was a killer six ways from Sunday.  My friends inside
said it was impossible.  The first director had been savaged by the NBS
establishment, the next was scheduled to be eaten up by the industry.  And
Congress was angry at the delays and obfuscations.  Woooooo!  I jumped at it.

<p>

All this, from Cuthbert's initial phone call through a hurried reconnaissance
to Gaithersburg [10-11 May 1967] to my enthusiastic acceptance ("drafted
again!") took only a week.  Joyce thought I was crazy, the boys said they
wouldn't leave Santa Barbara, and my putative boss Allen Astin was warning me
he needed me at hearings Jack Brooks was setting up only days ahead.  Even for
me, it was a wild wild scene.

<p>

About the key figures: Hurd, readers know from earlier chapters, and he
dropped out of the picture the day I was sworn in.  Allen, or "Dr. Astin" as
even his oldest associates called him, had been director of the Bureau for
decades.  He had planned and carried out the gigantic relocation of NBS from
Connecticut and Van Ness in the center of the District, to an impressive
campus Outside The Beltway - indeed, half way to Frederick - in then-rural
Maryland.  He had struggled with the costs, worried about staff problems (no
public transportation for the support people, much-diminished contact with the
D.C.  scientific establishment for the senior and ambitious-junior staff
members), thought very carefully about moving the metrology operations and
their historical standards, considered the effect on remote Bureau operations
in Boulder, Colorado.  He had done it beautifully, and in spite of everything
his superiors in Commerce and an Irish yahoo in Congress who apparently hated
science and scientists and Allen's handsome 75-foot flagpole in the center of
the Gaithersburg site, could and did put in his way.  Genuinely a great
figure; not a Watson, not a Gerry Neumann, but a towering presence in
Conservative Science.

<p>

 He had endured one horrid Washington torment called The Battery Additive
Scandal.  An innocuous and very minor NBS report had noted in passing that a
doping liquid which was supposed to extend the life and effectiveness of
conventional lead-acid storage batteries was worthless, and the manufacturer
had descended wrathfully on his tame congressmen and the stupids at the top of
Commerce, and had the initially mystified Astin yanked out of his directorship
instanter.

<p>

The science community, and not just the conservatives, rose to a man [ah,
person] in his defense, and he was reinstated.  But it shook the Bureau to its
foundations, and painfully reminded its neighbors in Washington, and technical
people all over the country and the world, that there was Science and there
was Money And Power, and they sometimes, indeed often, clashed.

<p>

Jack Brooks was on the Power side, but not a yahoo, not a stupid.  He
represented Beaumont, Texas (east of Houston, north of Galveston) in the
House.  He was a tough ex-Marine, and in his position as head of the
Government Activities Subcommittee of the Committee On Government Operations
had become dubious about the efficiency of computer use across the Federal
spectrum, from old-established Census Univacs to the networks beginning to
spread across the nation.  He should have been even more dubious about the
wilder computer shores of the Pentagon; I don't know to this day whether he
more or less exempted them as White Hats or saw them as too powerful to
challenge directly.  But his first efforts at a bill to put more control in
the hands of GSA, the General Services Administration, especially as regards
procurement and service operations, had not prospered.

<p>

His newer bill had become law a year back, and it was to review its effects so
far that he was calling hearings in June, before the House scattered for the
summer.  The NBS involvement was crucial, since it was the addition of
technical surveillance to the administrative and financial governance that
made PL89-306 different from the earlier legislation.  The policy matters had
been handed to the Bureau of the Budget [now OMB], procurement and shared
services were still with GSA, and Commerce in the shape of its Bureau of
Standards was told to provide technical leadership and to institute standards.

<p>

Staff functions regarding computers, which among many other interactions were
setting up the hearings, were run for Brooks by one Ernie Baynard.  I came to
like him somewhat, but never to the point of expecting him to care a fig about
HRJG, nor to the point of my forgetting the aphorism about A Little Knowledge.
I'll come back to these and other Congressional figures later.

<p>

I had been told by Hurd, and at considerable length by my insider friends at
and near the Bureau, that there had been a scaffolding erected when CCST, the
Center for Computer Sciences and Technology, was started up.  In spite of the
need to immediately placate Brooks and the bemused Secretary of Commerce, it
had been called a Center rather than an Institute, as the physics and
metrology and other "Old Bureau" [ie pre-WW II and even pre-WW I] major
partitions were labeled.  It thus held a mezzanine position in the Institute
of Applied Technology, which also had divisions doing building safety [fire
codes], metrication, and similar miscellanies regarded with scorn by the
purists.

<p>

Start-up had been so painful that the conflict over promises by Commerce and
Astin himself to upgrade the newborn to full Institute status, and the overt
and covert efforts in Gaithersburg to knock it down to a division, had never
been resolved.  So I came in as a report (albeit as a Director; division heads
were only Chiefs) to one John Eberhard, director of IAT.

<p>

It was he and not Astin who stood beside me as I was hastily hastily sworn in.
The Civil Service, shuddersome custodian of the bureaucracy, had outdone
itself by finding my old resignation papers from 1943 BuOrd in some West
Virginia cave - the originals, not microfilms! - and using the antique wording
about the Navy "not interposing" objections to a re-hire, had processed me in
to full robust bureaucratic status in four days.  And in order to get me top
dollar, the same as the GS-18 heads of full NBS institutes, they invoked
PL-313 status, which had been invented a few years before to bring my old
friend Wernher von Braun into Civil Service and Huntsville.  It paid only
$36,000 a year, but it was the most a GS could then hope for.  Next step up in
those days was to Astin's rank, E-5 ["Executive"], which reported to an E-4
assistant secretary, which reported to a Cabinet E-1 like Commerce or an E-2
like the head of NASA.  The fancier Es required congressional approval, and
all served at the "pleasure" of the President.

<p>

Shades of Generous Electric!  Of course Smiddy would have prescribed a
seven-person cabinet and bundled 49 E-2s under same.  He would have said no
E-3s, since Unders or Deputies were proscribed in 1955 GE.  There would have
been just over two thousand E-5s, which was indeed the 1967 real-life case
among the Feds.

<p>

John was an architect by profession, and had been picked to head the catch-all
institute at a time when fire safety and building codes were high in priority
on The Hill.  He served Astin during the Johnson era, when the Assistant
Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology (ruling the Weather Bureau
and the Census as well as NBS) was one Herb Hollomon.  Hollomon knew John, and
in fact even knew a little about me, since he had come out of General Electric
in 1950 in the sub-cabinet hirings of that year, and had kept his connections,
especially to GE's research areas.

<p>

He "interposed" no objections to bringing me aboard.  And John had no desire
to hang on to the unruly and (at least within NBS) unassimilated CCST crew,
which at my mid-1967 advent numbered 205.  I had run 175 in my GE heyday, but
I'd built up that outfit from a nubbin, while CCST was a congeries of old NBS
and extra-NBS bods dating back to John Curtiss, the WPA Math Tables Project,
wonderful but difficult Sam Alexander and the SEAC, and even a couple of
indigenous computing helpmeets from earlier desk-calculator-support times.
Hiding behind the arras was, amazingly, Howard Gammon of the old Clewlow
Committee, and surely he still knew of subterranean passages leading back to
Policy Country.

<p>

CCST was mostly organized into six divisions, which even in the first weeks I
felt no need to reclump.  And I had a vigorous but difficult lead secretary,
who thought of herself as really running the joint in the absence of a
director.  Kitty Bailey, her name was, and she ran a shop with two "girls" who
took dictation and typed (no copy machines yet!) and covered for her during
her political forays.  She was of course a mine of information, but I was wary
- I had trusted Jean Miller implicitly, but -..

<p>

For many years I had had a warm friendship with Ethel Marden, one of the very
first programmers on Sam Alexander's SEAC.  Ethel was head of what I would
today call a software division, was the first in the Center to hear of my
possible apotheosis, and the first to call me, warn me of the horrors of NBS
opposition, of CCST divided loyalties, and beg me to come anyhow.  We are
still good friends, 35 years later.  She went so far as to offer explicitly to
resign her chiefship if I came, and let me hire "one of my own people" - what
a woman!  I could sense the tensions between her and Kitty, and between her
and another female chief from SEAC/SWAC times, and was sure I could benefit
from it.

<p>

That other chief was Margaret Fox, who as I have said was Sam Alexander's
right-hand "man" for many years.  She was the nexus of the "it ought to be
Sam" faction in CCST, which had helped the rest of NBS undermine my
unfortunate predecessor.  I didn't have to hear that from Ethel or Kitty - I
could almost smell the poison dripping from her fangs at my first staff
meetings.

<p>

Before I go on to other denizens of CCST I'll tell about the horrid months of
its 1966 creation.  The first director, who could not have had friends inside
the moat as I had had, was Norman Ream.  I asked Cuthbert several times how
Norm could possibly have been selected, but never got a clear answer; he
perhaps didn't know, but more likely was afraid to scare off his last
bottom-of-the-barrel candidate!  Norm's background was accounting, his
experience and wingtip appearance IBM.  And they dumped him into a pool of PhD
scientists who hated the CCST idea, and hated pinstriped business types, and
(quietly) hated being told what to do by congressmen.

<p>

He barely managed to touch palms with his opposite number in Budget, Joe
Cunningham, and his opposite number in GSA, Ed Dwyer, and then NBS ate him up.
I never heard much from him, when I visited him later in the Pentagon, or from
Joe or Ed, about what he tried to do.  But it was obvious from internal traces
in CCST that even his simple attempts to set up housekeeping for "his"
Gaithersburgers had been thwarted.  Eberhard seemed hardly to have known him.

<p>

Norm managed to wangle a Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy post,
with a plush office and white-jacketed Filipino coffee server and such, and
escaped his Gaithersburg agonies.  CCST writhed and twisted on its mezzanine.
The Old Bureau types smirked.

<p>

This is a good place to tell about Hearing Day [19 July], the climax of my
first days at NBS.  Astin, supported by Eberhard and two or three CCST
persons, was scheduled to follow Cunningham and Dwyer in the late morning.  I
was perched at a Bethesda motel, and set out in good spirits in my top-down
California-plates Jag to experience my first Hearing.  A siren !!

<p>

I was dragged off to a station house, yammering about Brooks and Astin.  This
was Maryland; in the District they might have paid attention.  Finally an
unconcerned sergeant called Baynard's number (Ernie was at the hearings, of
course) and confirmed that a bearded crew-cut California freak was indeed
supposed to be on The Hill that day.  "Leave the car," he said.  I dashed out
and flagged a cab.

<p>

"Doctor, " Brooks is saying to Astin, "tell us about these computer
generations that seem to make federal installations become obsolete
overnight."  Astin turns to Eberhard, Eberhard turns to probably Joe Wegstein
- and I burst into the room!  Grrrrrrreat scene!

<p>

After minimal excuses, which do not appear in the printed proceedings, I
settled in.  I knew more about virtually any computer topic than the sum total
of all the audience and participants, including Cunningham and Dwyer and
Baynard, was quite willing to say so, and was as yet uncorrupted by much
knowledge of what Brooks wanted done, what Ream had tried to do, or what NBS
willingnesses (few), CCST capabilities (in sum, considerable), and cooperation
with Downtown (unexplored) could do.  The stenotypist folded his overheated
machine, and we all went away.

<p>

The story is told more formally in Hearings before a Subcommittee of the
Committee On Government Operations, House Of Representatives, Ninetieth
Congress July 18,19, and 20, 1967: "Data Processing Management In The Federal
Government", especially pp.69-106.  In rereading it I am most impressed by the
fact that Congressman Ogden Reid of New York referred to Korzybski and general
semantics.

<p>

Astin's craggy old face had flushed several times as I got off typical
zingers, some of which made Baynard scowl and some, Brooks grin.  My putative
boss was probably wishing for Genial Norm, or at least that he had not bought
this free-swinging replacement.  But as word filtered up from The Hill next
week, probably via Cunningham and Dwyer and perhaps Howard Gammon, that Brooks
had been if not convinced at least encouraged that NBS would keep trying,
things settled down.  Clearly the ex-Marine had found my frankness acceptable.

<p>

This is a good place to write about other differences I was coping with:
wives, sons, pets, houses, cars, even air conditioning.  I had left Kensington
for Lonn Guyland in wartime 1943, with Dorothy, in a very old second-hand
Plymouth, and with a small part-load of belongings to follow.  I was returning
in relative splendor 24 years later, a veteran computer expert instead of a
novice optical engineer.  I was at the very top instead at the bottom of the
civil service scale.  Trumpets were not exactly sounding, especially inside
NBS, but I was pretty pleased with myself.

<p>

It was not clear when I drove away from Santa Barbara whether the marriage was
shattered, but it certainly was badly fissured.  Joyce was angry at my
craziness, the boys didn't want to leave their father, their friends, their
schools.  Santa Barbara was (to me also) a lovely place.  And my wife had a
house, and we had pets, and the boys knew I'd never race again, and wanted to
go on with skiing at Mammoth.

<p>

I stopped off in Scottsdale and told some of this to Elizabeth, who kept
claiming we should get back together and clearly would fit the Fancy Fed
ambiance like hand in silken glove.  But she was adamant: "Dump your little
California floozy, and then we'll talk."  And I was due in Washington - hurry,
hurry, said Eberhard.

<p>

The Jag overheated.  A radiator big enough for coolish SB was too small for
summer cross country, and this pointed up that it couldn't possibly be
air-conditioned (and would be over-powered for Washington winter snow and
slush) - and I would be too busy for a hobby car, and not rich enough for a
3-car garage.

<p>

Well, as I struggled with NBS and CCST and standards, and Ernie Baynard, it
began to work out.  Joyce missed me, the boys missed me, the pets missed me,
the house was empty (and the little old Falcon inadequate).  I wrote loving
letters - I missed them too, all of them, in spite of the ravages of my new
job.  Joyce's replies, beautifully handwritten, grew more frequent as well as
warmer.  Yes, they would come - wife and boys and four pets (but not the
Falcon).  NBS would pay, and Eberhard tried to help me buck the system, for
instance by supporting reconciliation air trips.  On one of them I traded
Joyce's old car for a huge new navy blue Ford wagon, so that she and the boys
could drive across and see the wonders of early fall America.  Put it in her
name, which reassured her.  Said, ship the pets; I'll scoop 'em up at the
airport, and take care of 'em at the new house while you guys enjoy the
Rockies.

<p>

Joyce began to put sex in her letters.

<p>

John was still enough of an architect that he had bought an interesting house
instead of a center-hall colonial, in a Maryland development called Carderock
Springs, near the David Taylor Model Basin.  He encouraged me to rent a
similar place, with sloping lot and winding access, and lots of skinny pine
trees.  Three levels, big two-car attached garage, well designed but poorly
constructed.  I indeed decanted four crates of poodles and cats into its
considerable spaces a few days before the wagon arrived --- and a big
furniture van.  Don't remember any more how I camped out, but I was living
there in some fashion when the pets descended.

<p>

The grand arrival of the Santa Barbarans was greatly helped by a deep early
snowfall, so that Wyman and Walter could build snowmen and hug the poodles and
enthuse over their new house while Joyce and I laughed and cried.  Before
Thanksgiving!!

<p>

Before the pets and people arrived I had opened an account with the local bank
which had a branch inside the administration building at Gaithersburg.  That
gave me instant credit - GS-18 credit - with which I descended on the local
Porsche dealer.  He eagerly scooped up my lovely Jag and proffered a somewhat
special 911: a tweaked motor and Recaro racing bucket seats.  It was a placid
beige, where I would have preferred something more vigorous, or at least
elfenbein, but it was still pretty fancy.  And needless to say, it was air
conditioned!  I reluctantly passed on a rag-top.

<p>

I was stymied the day the pets arrived at Dulles; no way to handle four
shipping crates!  But Eberhard loaned me a wagon, and United agreed I could
keep the crates for an extra day (no way I could decant the victims into the
wagon, or from the wagon into the empty Carderock house, without losing one or
two).  We did Capitol sightseeing after the troops arrived in Joyce's big
Ford, frequently with two poodles leaping about (it too was air conditioned).

<p>

Parenthetically, the 911 had a curious advantage over the Ford, and other cars
with integrated air conditioning.  The A/C was an add-on, and could be run at
the same time as the German heating system.  The fogging up so common in
high-humidity climates could thereby be avoided: cooled air recirculated
dropped its moisture, and the heater warmed it back to comfort.

<p>

Joyce was pleased with the modern house, and of course it was larger than hers
in SB.  Each boy had his own room.  I no longer remember about radios or
record players or even TVs, but there must have been a proliferation.  Wyman
went into Winston Churchill, a very famous Montgomery County high school full
of Hill offspring, and Wallie was to follow him.  All this went very well, but
we all four agreed we would want to buy a place soon - keeping the Winston
Churchill connection.

<p>

Both boys were excited about the Porsche, and Joyce enjoyed driving it
occasionally.  But my horrid experience on Hearing Day turned out to be an
indicator of continuing trouble.  I drove on local roads to the notorious 495
Beltway, then north to NBS on 270.  And on the two major highways I was
repeatedly pulled over by troopers in cars or on motorcycles, even when I was
barely keeping up with traffic.  I dared not tiger, and in fact was usually
brooding over CCST complications - didn't matter.  I finally realized that it
was an ingrained dislike of Foreign Sport Cars, and traded the pretty Porsche
for a Mustang.  After that, no tickets for months at a time.

<p>

It was a regional thing.  I drove the Jag in California, and a later 240Z in
Massachusetts, with no problems.  Joyce, who sometimes got carried away by the
sensuous pleasures of the former, got stopped in SB a couple of times, but her
brother George was a local cop -.  It was a minor warning that while the
District was a world capital, it was embedded in the Maryland and Virginia
countryside.

A COMPUTER PIONEER still active at the policy level, and very much concerned
about futures in the computer field, Dr. Grosch is known for the relationship
between speed and cost which he discovered in the early Fifties.  He worked
twice for IBM, twice for GE, and twice for the Federal government - the
second time as director of the Bureau of Standards institute which was charged
with improving the overall effectiveness of government information processing.

<p>

He lived and worked in Europe for many years, and consulted for companies
there, in North America, and in Japan.  Many years ago he was active in
celestial mechanics and in optical design; later, before becoming the first
manager of IBM's space program, he was president of the major aerospace
society.  He was a charter member of the Association for Computing Machinery,
and is a former president and council member of that 84,000-member
organization.

<p>

He has been a contributing editor of DATAMATION, was on the editorial board of
MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY, and for some years was editorial director of
COMPUTERWORLD.  He travels and speaks widely, both to technical and to popular
audiences; in his speeches as well as his writings he is renowned for his
insights and notorious for his frankness.
