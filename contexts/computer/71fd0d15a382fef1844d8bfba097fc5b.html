<h4>Before you read on, read this!</h4>
<p>There are several issues that can cause a Windows XP computer to not reboot properly after installing Service Pack 3. Most of them affect relatively specific configurations, and&nbsp;most appear to have relatively simple work-arounds. Please: do not do anything rash. I have seen a lot of reports of people who reformat&nbsp;and reinstall when they run into this problem, losing all their data in the process. There is often no need to do anything that drastic. First read this post, and see if anything here helps you. If&nbsp;not, call Microsoft&#39;s technical support line and see if they can&#39;t&nbsp;help you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not yet installed SP3, make sure you disable, or better yet, remove, any anti-malware suite before doing so. If you do not, it is possible that you will get various kinds of corruption during the installation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Free SP3 Support from Microsoft</h4>
<p>EmilySc, a Microsoft employee, <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/technet/showpost.aspx?postid=3324712&amp;siteid=17&amp;sb=0&amp;d=1&amp;at=7&amp;ft=11&amp;tf=0&amp;pageid=12">posted in the newsgroups</a> yesterday that there is now free installation and troubleshooting support for SP3. This may be a real help to those who need interactive help solving the problem. </p>
<p>You can <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?ln=en-us&amp;prid=11273&amp;gprid=522131">find all the support options&nbsp;on the Microsoft Support Website</a>. In North America, free telephone support is available by calling (866) 234-6020. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>Last night WSUS deployed XP Service Pack 3 (SP3)&nbsp;to the sole remaining computer running XP that I have. This morning, I came down and was greeted with incessant reboots. The computer booted, apologized for not being able to boot properly, asked if I wanted to boot into safe mode, defaulted to normal boot, rebooted, and so on and so on. At this point,&nbsp;I want to clarify that the endless rebooting is not at all related to SP3 per se. The problem is that with some configurations, SP3 causes the computer to crash during boot, and Windows XP, by default, is set up to automatically reboot when it crashes. That is why you end up in the endless rebooting scenario.</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons why a computer may crash at boot time. SP3 seems to introduce two that are related to AMD-based computers, and, possibly, one or two more that appear to affect Intel-based computers. Which one it is impacts which work-around you use. At this point, the information is still trickling in. If you have a crash on boot problem that does not match what I describe below, and it happened as soon as you installed SP3, I&#39;m sure others would like to know as well, including as much detail as you can give us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>First problem, affecting AMD-based computers with OEM images, primarily HP Desktops</h4>
<h5>NEW: Use this tool to mitigate the problem</h5>
<p>If you have an AMD-based computer, and all you want to do is prevent the problem before installing Service Pack 3, then try <a href="http://msinfluentials.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.PostAttachments/00.00.00.76.47/removeIntelPPMonAMD.vbs">the new tool I just wrote</a>. It will first check whether you have an AMD-based computer. If you do it will check whether the IntelPPM driver is set to load. If it is it will offer you an option to disable it. <a href="http://msinfluentials.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.PostAttachments/00.00.00.76.47/removeIntelPPMonAMD.vbs">The tool</a> works by simply double-clicking it. If you need to check many computers on a network you can do that by running it from the command line, using this command:</p>
<p>removeIntelPPMonAMD.vbs &lt;computer 1&gt; &lt;computer 2&gt; &lt;computer 3&gt;...</p>
<p>It will take an arbitrary number of computers. The only caveat is that the tool will prompt you several times for each computer. If you really need a silent version, I can probably be persuaded to write one for you. </p>
<p>Note that if you are downloading the tool on Safari there is a bug in how Safari handles these types of downloads. If you just click on the link Safari will save the tool with a .txt extension instead and open it. You can remove that extension and then double-click the tool to run it. If you right-click the link and select &quot;Download link as...&quot; Safari will put the name on the containing page on the tool, not the name of the tool itself. You would need to rename it to something with a .vbs extension first to use it. Neither Firefox nor Internet Explorer makes it this difficult to download that tool, although Firefox does not properly handle right-clicking and selecting &quot;Save link as...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> the tool is provided &quot;as is&quot; with no warranty express or implied. It is designed to make changes to your system and those changes always carries a risk. Even though I have tested it as much as I can, I cannot guarantee that it will work for you. By running the tool you agree to hold me harmless for any damage it may cause to your computer. </p>
<h5>Problem Details</h5>
<p>In my case, the computer&nbsp;would boot into safe mode fine, so I did that. Not knowing what it was, I ran a disk check, which turned out to be a real mistake. Once I configured the computer to run a disk check at startup it would not even boot into safe mode.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know Bill Castner, another Microsoft MVP, and he pointed me to a solution. It turns out that this computer is running an OEM OS image from HP. If you have an HP computer with a part number that&nbsp;ends with a &#39;z&#39; you have an AMD-based computer. Other manufacturers have also shipped AMD-based computers, but it is unclear whether they have built their images the same way HP did. </p>
<p>The problem is that HP, and possibly&nbsp;other OEMs, deploy the same image to Intel-based desktops that they do to AMD-based desktops. It also appears that this is unique to their desktop image, and any HP AMD-based laptops are unaffected by the problem. Because the image for both Intel and AMD is the same&nbsp;all have the intelppm.sys driver installed and running. That driver provides power management on Intel-based computers. On an AMD-based computer, amdk8.sys provides the same functionality. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888372">Microsoft points out in a Knowledge Base article</a> that installing both drivers on the same computer is an unsupported configuration, putting the blame on the OEM that deploys the image. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888372">The article in question</a> was written when the same problem occurred after installing Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. </p>
<p>Ordinarily, having intelppm.sys listed in the registry on an AMD-based computer appears to cause no problems, so long as the binary does not actually run. On HPs images, the driver is not installed, even though the driver is listed in the registry and supposed to load. However, on the first reboot after a service pack installation, it causes a big problem. The computer either fails to boot, as in my case, or crashes with a STOP error code of 0x0000007e. If you see that error code you almost certainly have this problem.&nbsp;The&nbsp;computer will boot into safe mode because the drivers are disabled there. Please note here that simply having the intelppm.sys file on your computer is not the problem so searching for it in the Windows directory is not relevant. Nor is only having a directive in the registry to load it a problem. It must be running to cause a problem, which means the file has to both exist on the disk, and the registry has to be configured to load it. Therein lies the problem. HPs images have the registry key set but no driver on disk. When the service pack is installed the pre-existing directive in the registry is read, the installer lays down the driver on the disk, and on the next reboot it launches, causing the crash.</p>
<p>You may not see the error code because the computer reboots too fast. To force the computer to stop when it crashes, you need to set an option during startup. To do so, hit the F8 key during restart right when you see the black Windows XP screen come up. Then select the &quot;Disable automatic restart on system failure&quot; option, as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/Disable%20Automatic%20Restart.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/Disable%20Automatic%20Restart.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>To fix the problem, boot into safe mode, or boot to a WinPE disk, or into the recovery console, and disable the intelppm.sys driver. </p>
<p><em><span style="color:#ff0000;">WARNING: Do NOT under any circumstance disable the intelppm driver on an&nbsp;Intel-based computer. It will make your computer not boot! If your computer will not boot because you disabled the intelppm driver on an Intel-based computer, follow the directions in the Recovery Console section below.</span></em></p>
<p>If you have an AMD-based computer, however, you do not need the intelppm driver and can disable it.&nbsp;Boot into Safe Mode by hitting the F8 key as above, but select Safe Mode instead. You will need your Administrator account to log on in safe mode. To disable the driver, take the following steps:</p>
<p>If you booted into the recovery console, from a command prompt, run &quot;disable intelppm&quot;</p>
<p>If you booted into safe mode you can run &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot;</p>
<p>If you booted into WinPE, you have to manually edit the registry. Do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Run regedit</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>From the File menu, select &quot;Load hive&quot;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Navigate to %systemdriver%\Windows\System32\Config on the dead system and select the file name System</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Name it something you can remember, such as &quot;horked&quot;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Navigate to horked\&lt;the current control set&gt;\Services\IntelPPM. See below for how to determine which one is the current control set. </div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Double click the Start value and set it to 4</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>If you did what I did and completely destroyed things by running a disk check, navigate to &lt;the current control set&gt;\Control\SessionManager. Open the BootExecute value and clear out the autochk entries</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Reboot</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 6 asks you to navigate to &lt;the current control set&gt;. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM there are typically at least two numbered control sets, and sometimes there are up to four. They are called ControlSet001, ControlSet002, and so on. Control sets hold all the configuration data for the computer, including all drivers that load. One of them is designated the current one, and the others are backups of previous configurations that worked. The control set that is currently used as the current one is the one listed in the &quot;Current&quot; value under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Select. That is the control set that you need to modify in step 6. If you modify one of the other control sets it will not solve the problem. You need to modify the current one. If you manage to boot the computer, CurrentControlSet will be a pointer to the current one and you can modify that one. If you boot from the recovery disk you have to figure out which one is the current to modify the proper one. It will not always be ControlSet001.</p>
<p>If this was your problem, the computer should now reboot just fine.</p>
<h5>HPs Response</h5>
<p>On May 13, 2008 <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=c01457284&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN">HP posted a support article on this problem</a>. In that article they claim that the Service Pack copies the intelppm.sys driver to the computer even though it was not there before the Service Pack was deployed. </p>
<p>HP is partially correct. On their desktop images the intelppm.sys file does not exist in the %systemroot%\system32\drivers directory prior to installing the service pack. However, on its laptop images the file <em>does</em> exist there.&nbsp;By contrast, on the HP desktop images the intelppm registry key does exist under HKML\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet, and it directs the driver to start. On the laptop images, the registry key does <em>not</em> exist. This is why HPs desktop images exhibit the problem and the laptop images are fine. It is not the presence of the driver on disk that is the problem. It is the instruction to load it that HP put into the registry that causes the problem. </p>
<p>That would also explain why the SP3 installer lays down the driver file on disk even though it did not previously exist. I would expect that the installer looks at all the drivers listed in the registry and simply makes sure that there are updated versions of all of them, without checking first whether they existed prior to installing the service pack. After all, if a driver is listed in the registry, and the operating system is instructed to load it, developers could very easily make the assumption that the driver is present on the computer and actually does load. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether the driver file is there or not, I still have to say that the problem is that the registry key should not exist on an AMD-based computer, regardless of what files are laid down on disk. It is not the presence of a file that causes a problem, but the instruction to load that file on boot, and that instruction is represented by the registry key. It is perfectly legitimate to lay down all kinds of files on disk during installation but not load them. In fact, HP itself lays down the intelppm.sys file in the i386 directory - the on-disk cache directory of operating system files. This strategy is also used successfully by Microsoft Office, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and several Adobe Products. It prevents the user from needing access to the original disks to update, repair, or modify an installation. </p>
<p>What this means is that if you have one of the affected HP desktop computers you can prevent the problem before it even starts. Before installing the service pack go to a command prompt and run either of these commands:</p>
<p>reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Intelppm /v Start /d&nbsp;4 /t REG_DWORD</p>
<p>sc config intelppm start= disabled</p>
<p>Both commands will disable the driver before you install the service pack and will prevent the problem from ever occuring. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Potential impact on Media Center</h5>
<p>Two separate posters have reported problems with Windows Media Center after this work-around. At this point, I am not ready to say that this is caused by using the work-around, but if you have this problem, I would appreciate a note to confirm it. </p>
<p>Logically, it could be related. This is pure speculation, but based on what I know about the Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Media Center it may detect the change in hardware, disabling the intelppm driver,&nbsp;as a hostile action and disables viewing DRM protected content. Unfortunately, Comcast Cable puts a DRM signal into some of their cable channels, which means you can no longer watch those channels. You would also be unable to watch previously recorded content. The content provided by Comcast&nbsp;is not actually encrypted, but Windows enforces the DRM nevertheless. </p>
<p>I had a very <a href="http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/archive/2007/09/24/blue-screen-of-drm-death-or-the-death-of-windows-media-center.aspx">similar problem</a> with Media Center last year. At the time I was unable to resolve it. However, I would encourage anyone who has this problem to try <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/webhelp/default.aspx?&amp;id=C00D2798">resetting the DRM components in Media Center</a>. If that does not work, try re-enabling the intelppm driver and see if that helps. It should be safe to do so if the intelppm.sys file is not present in the %systemroot%\system32\drivers directory (check first), and once the computer has booted properly after the service pack installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill Castner, who is rapidly becoming my new hero, also posted <a href="http://forum.aumha.org/viewtopic.php?f=62&amp;p=188111">a solid work-around for Media Center problems</a> over in the AumHa forums. Try that one as well, it may solve your problems too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Second problem, affecting certain AMD motherboards</h4>
<p>The second problem type manifests itself in a different error code during boot, and also seems to affect only AMD-based computers. The error code will say something similar to:</p>
<div><em>Problem was detected and windows has been shut down to protect your computer from damage. </em></div>
<div><em></em>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI compliant </em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will then get some information about how to update your BIOS. The BIOS is the basic operating system built into the computer that handles reading and writing from disk and memory, as well as some other devices. That is most likely not your problem. The screen ends with the tell-tale error code: <em>STOP: 0x000000A5.</em> If you have that error code, and you just installed SP3, this is most likely your problem. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At the moment, I do not know for sure why this is happening, and I have not personally seen it. The problem appears to be the <span style="font-size:x-small;">ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard, also with an AMD processor. Several different AMD processors have been fitted on that board, however, so it seems more likely to be the board than the processor. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:x-small;"></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size:x-small;">The solution is simplicity itself: insert a USB flash drive, or some other form of secondary storage mechanism, before booting the computer. The people have that have seen this problem report that it goes away when they do. The catch is that the computer will only boot with a secondary&nbsp;drive attached. If you remove the secondary drive it will no longer boot. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:x-small;"></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size:x-small;">It also appears that this could be related to using a USB mouse. If you have a USB mouse, try moving it to the PS/2 port instead (the little round port, you should have received an adapter with your mouse). That seems to resolve the problem without the use of an external USB flash drive. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:x-small;"></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size:x-small;">If you have this problem, and either solution helps, or even if they do not help, I&#39;d appreciate a comment on the blog so we can figure out what is going on here. </span></div>
<h4>Other STOP Errors</h4>
<p>Every time a service pack is installed, or any major maintenance like it is performed, a certain, very small,&nbsp;number of computers seem to not come back up. The reasons could range from malware on them that is conflicting with the installation or the new files, to bad hardware that somehow failed at that very moment. </p>
<p>For that reason, there may be other STOP errors involved in this problem. Due to the default settings in XP, all of them would result in an endless reboot cycle. Only if there are many of them does it usually indicate a problem with the service pack. A fair number of people are reporting an error code 0x00000024. It usually means either that the file system driver, ntfs.sys, has been corrupted, or you have a hard disk with bad blocks in bad places. It could be totally unrelated to the service pack. At this point, I just do not have enough details to tell. This one seems to be more related to Intel-based computers though. </p>
<p>It is also possible that 0x00000024 has to do with a faulty video driver. I have seen a couple of reports of crashes caused by the ATI Catalyst 8.4 drivers, and one of a crash involving an nVidia driver of some kind, but I do not know which one. To see if that is your problem, try booting into Safe Mode or VGA mode. If VGA mode works you very likely have a video driver issue. Gary Barclay, in a comment below, pointed out that the 8.432 version of the driver may be the one that is faulting, and that version 8.467 appears to work properly. If anyone else can confirm that I&#39;m sure may others will be happy about it. </p>
<p>If you are getting the 0x00000024 error, there are some&nbsp;things to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is some&nbsp;good <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935806">information in the Microsoft knowledge base</a> on how to trouble-shoot STOP errors. Try following that. &nbsp;</li>
<li>If you have multiple drives in the computer, disconnect them one by one and try booting. The problem may not be on your primary drive and this could let you isolate which one has the problem.</li>
<li>Run chkdsk /r. The problem could be file system related, and chkdsk could fix it. However, to do that you have to boot the computer successfully. If you have a 0x00000024 error, it will not boot even into safe mode. You will need to follow the instructions in the Recovery Console or WinPE sections below to boot the computer.</li>
<li>Replace the ntfs.sys driver. If the driver file itself has become corrupted there is a backup copy in the %windir%\system32\dllcache folder. If nothing else helps, you could try replacing the version in %windir%\system32\drivers folder with the one from dllcache and see if maybe it was a corrupted file problem.</li>
<li>If you have an ATI or nVidia driver for for your graphics card, notably the ATI Catalyst 8.4, and your computer will not boot, try booting into VGA mode and see if that works. If it does, you almost certainly have a video driver problem. Uninstall the driver and see if Windows will find a better one. If this works for you, please either contact me using the contact link, or post a comment, so others can learn what is really happening here. </li>
</ol>
<p>There have also been sporadic reports of video driver problems as well as other issues, like the VPN issues. Most of those have to do with some form of third-party software that does not work with SP3. If you have a problem that is not covered here, it would be good if you could let us know. It may be related to SP3, in which case others may have it too. The VPN issue mentioned by one of the posters has me very interested, for example. </p>
<p>Other people are reporting that the computer is complaining that a particular file is corrupted. Sometimes the corruption results in a blue screen, other times something does not work right after the computer reboots.&nbsp; At this point I am not sure what could be causing this, and I would encourage anyone who runs into that problem to call the Microsoft support line listed above. If they manage to figure out what the problem is, please post back here so the rest of us can find out. </p>
<h4>Conflicts with Certain Wireless Card Drivers</h4>
<p>Tim Steele read the blog and found that his problem was not solved. After doing some more research he discovered a conflict with certain wireless cards. I asked if I could post his discovery. This is what he wrote:</p>
<p>Some 802.11b wireless cards cause XP to blue screen after installing SP3</p>
<p>If you have any of the following 802.11b wireless cards you&#39;ll see a blue screen after installing SP3:</p>
<p>SMC 2635W, Belkin F5D6001, Linksys WPC11 v1, Blitz NetWave Point PC, Xterasys Cardbus XN-2411b, D-Link DWL-520 Revision C, Xterasys Cardbus XN-2411b, Fiberline FL-WL-200X, 3com Office Connect 3CRSHPW796, Corega WLPCIB-11, SMC 2602W V2, and D-Link DWL-520 Revision C.</p>
<p>These cards all use the adm8211 chipset. The driver was provided by ADMtek and badged by the vendors. The last version on the net seems to be 1.80. The D-Link driver is WHQL certified and signed.</p>
<p>There are plenty of adm8211 cards out there inside machines which are about to update to SP3, Windows Update doesn&#39;t check whether you have one of these cards before automatically installing SP3, so the effect for many users will be a mysterious blue screen and no obvious cause.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not clear whether the vendors or Microsoft should be responsible for fixing this, but surely as a minimum SP3 should not install on machines with this hardware.</p>
<h4>Conflicts with Anti-Malware Software</h4>
<p>Gregg Keizer wrote an <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9088598&amp;pageNumber=1">interesting couple of articles in Computer World</a> (<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9089658&amp;source=NLT_PM&amp;nlid=8">second piece is here</a>) about conflicts between Symantec&#39;s anti-malware suites and SP3. It appears all but certain that the anti-malware suites cause registry corruption, failures in device manager, and other problems, when you install SP3. An interesting <a href="http://community.norton.com/norton/board/message?board.id=nis_feedback&amp;thread.id=967">thread on Symantec&#39;s support forums</a> documents some of the problems. There are <a href="http://norton.lithium.com/norton/board/message?board.id=nis_feedback&amp;thread.id=967&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=2">directions for how to disable Symantec&#39;s software</a> in another thread. </p>
<p>The security suites add significant hooks into the operating systems. It is quite possible that they will prevent a major installation, such as a service pack, from completing properly. For that reason, you should at the very least disable any anti-malware or security software you have installed prior to installing the service pack. If you can uninstall it, install the service pack, and then reinstall the anti-malware software, you will probably have even greater chance of success. </p>
<h4>Using the Recovery Console in XP</h4>
<p>If you cannot boot into safe mode you can try using the Recovery Console in Windows XP. This requires you to have a Windows XP CD. Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654">307654</a> has directions on how to use it. You do not need to follow the instructions for how to install it. In fact, if you have a problem like the 0x00000024 issue above, you probably can not boot from an installed recovery console anyway.</p>
<p>In brief, to boot from the recovery console in XP, do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Insert your Windows XP CD</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Boot the computer</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Select to boot from the CD. On many computers you have to hit a button to do that. On Dell computers the button is usually F12. On HP it is usually ESC.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The computer will work for a while and eventually you get a screen that says &quot;Welcome to Setup&quot;. Hit the R key here</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>If will ask you which installation you want to boot. If you have several XP installations on this computer, select the one you want. Of course, if you have several installations, and one still works, you would not need these steps.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Type the administrator password for the installation you need to repair. </div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you should be at a command prompt. The commands you can run are very limited and they are often different from what you are used to. If you have disabled the intelppm driver on an Intel-based computer and need to re-enable it, run &quot;enable intelppm SERVICE_SYSTEM_START&quot;. </p>
<p>If you need to run chkdsk you can do it from the recovery console window as well. The C: drive is the boot volume in your Windows XP installation. To run the full check run &quot;chkdsk c: /p /r&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Build a WinPE Disk on a Flash Drive</h4>
<p>Another option, recommended for advanced users, is to have a Windows PE disk handy. Windows PE is a miniature version of Window that can boot from a CD, and starting with Windows Vista, a USB Flash Drive. I wrote up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470101555?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=protectyourwi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470101555">directions on how to build a Flash Drive with Windows PE</a> in the Vista book, and there are now also <a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/31b6b2c0-2739-4204-88f0-2000a4b9e20a1033.mspx?mfr=true">directions on TechNet</a>. You need to have access to a computer that boots, and you need a copy of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=94BB6E34-D890-4932-81A5-5B50C657DE08&amp;displaylang=en">Automated Installation Kit (WAIK)</a>. Once you burn the AIK image to a disk you can install it and start building your Win PE disk. </p>
<p>Using a Windows PE disk you get access to all the normal tools, like regedit. It has far more features than what you have with the recovery console, but requires a lot more prep work to get started. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Removing SP3</h4>
<p>A few people decided the problems were sufficient to just remove SP3 altogether. If you have a problem that is not covered above, that may be your best option for the moment. Microsoft just published an <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950249/en-us">article on how to remove the service pack</a>. It includes information on how to remove it even from the Recovery Console, so even if your computer will not boot you should be able to do it. </p><p><img src="http://msinfluentials.com/ink/45.ashx?633458446222030000" alt="" /></p><div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>I installed SP3 on my Compaq (AMD-based) laptop, and immediately experienced the endless loop - no getting into safe mode either. &nbsp;I was able to restore the Disk Image I created prior to the install, but it still wasted a couple hours. &nbsp;I&#39;ll try your &#39;fix&#39; and reinstall SP3 to see how it works out. &nbsp;Of course, I have made a Disk Image in case I end up in the loop again.</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper,</p>
<p>I installed windows xp sp3 and got the coontinuous reboots. The error code is 0xc0000189 Media is write protected. I cannot boot in safe mode or in any other mode. I can only get the command prompt. I renamed the intelppm file but that did not help. &nbsp; I would deeply appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>

		                <p>I had similar problems on February Beta installation.</p>
<p>The way I resolved two diffrent ways based on this problem thread.</p>
<p>1. On old Desktop AMD processor - After installing SP3 and before rebooting, I changed Reg Key (as suggested in discussion thread) from 1 to 0. &nbsp;I do not remember which one exactly is it. &nbsp;The computer started normally.</p>
<p>2. The second problem resolved AMD &nbsp;Core2 64 HP Laptop. &nbsp;I have rebooted before fixing the problem. Then I moved a small file from patch directory to System 32 folder &nbsp;using Norton utility. &nbsp;That fixed the problem.</p>
<p>I am so sorry that at this time I am unable to give the details of that small file.</p>

		                <p>I have had two customers with Dell Precision 390 workstations (new last fall) running xp sp3 32bit, have the constant (reboot) problem and the systems could not be brought up in safe mode.</p>
<p>I had to do a windows repair from the original dell cd.</p>
<p>I was able to start the recovery console, but when I tried to run chkdsk /p it told me there were numerous disk errors and that it couldn&#39;t continue.</p>
<p>I then tried to boot up in PXE and I got the same message.</p>
<p>Finally I tried the recovery again with the dell disk and i ran chkdsk with no parameters (also no login) and it fixed some of the errors, and finally I restarted a third time, did have to login to an install and I could run chkdsk /p.</p>
<p>Windows would then start up and allow me to login. Auto updates wanted to install sp3 so i let it after running virus checks etc, and checking logs for errors. I ran a thorough disk scan and it showed no errors. I&#39;ve had to spend many hours driving across town (west side of detroit to east side) and will have to make a return trip with the pc. </p>
<p>This will cost my customer $$$ and they / me are not happy about it............</p>

		                <p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out how, in an org Microsoft&#39;s size, that something as significant as XP SP3 managed to pass QA without a show-stopping bug of this magnitude being caught. Is MSFT internal QA only testing on Intel boards? What&#39;s even more surprising is that none of the early beta testers caught this bug; although it&#39;s really MSFT&#39;s responsibility, more eyes should have revealed this before GA.</p>

		                <p>Hi there. For me this is another trick from M$ to try to get out XP. For a long time now they was saying a lot of things about Vista and they want to force us to us that piece of crap. So, with this *** called SP3 for XP they show us their real intentions. Is a shame that a company as M$ doesn&#39;t have a very good QA staff to detect this things before it&#39;s affect consumers. </p>

		                <p>I had the Boot problem On My AMD Dual core &nbsp;Opteron165/DFI Lanparty Motherboard running Raid 0 with 2 raptors . &nbsp;I ended up formatting &nbsp;My system and tried a fresh install with SP3 and still the same problem.The only way I could get my Computer to boot with sp3 was to Setup on A Single drive. I may have had other issues but (don&#39;t have a clue what they might have been though) because everything was Running Great Until SP3. I had the same problem On My AM2 Machine until I went to a Single Drive.Who knows, But thats What I have found that works for me and the only thing at this point in time.</p>

		                <p>I installed SP3 at work on a new in Feb. Dell Optiplex 330. It is a dual core Intel. I got a BSOD on reboot saying OLE32.DLL (from what I recall) was missing. I believe the error code was 139. I was unable to reboot in safe mode, nor could I use an XP disk to boot as the SATA driver was not found for the hard drive. The box didn&#39;t have a floppy so F6 was unavailable. Basically, we had to reinstall the original image to get it running again. Something is very wrong with this service pack. What is strange is other similar computers here loaded fine. &nbsp;</p>

		                <p>Posting on behalf of my brother above. Does anyone have any recommendations for solving the 0x00000024 issue? This is on I believe an AMD based HP machine having first attempted an SP3 install, got the reboot issue, uninstalled SP3 via safe mode, then tried again and this time had the disabling of intelppm fix done on it which resulted in the 24 error and no access to safe mode.</p>
<p>Using the recovery console which is on one of the HP tools discs, the console it seems can&#39;t even find Windows! From what I gather, it just drops into a C:\ prompt and chkdsk just reports unrecoverable errors. Other commands appear to fail as if it can&#39;t find the Windows install.</p>
<p>We&#39;re looking at a complete system loss here and only option is a destructive recovery with the HP discs (these discs don&#39;t find the Windows install either to repair it).</p>

<p>If the computer boots into safe mode use the advice above to check the status of the intelppm driver by looking at the registry as I document above. Simply having the driver on the disk is not the problem. It is having it running that is. </p>

		                <p>Rick: I would start pulling drives out of the computer and see if that helps. I don't know what could be causing your problem. It's not like the others in that you are not getting a crash. Ironically, that makes it much harder to troubleshoot.</p>

		                <p>Francesco, what did you do when you were in the recovery console? 0x74 means your system configuration is broken somehow. Usually it means the registry is corrupted or you just installed some hardware that is not working. </p>
<p>One option is to try the &quot;Last known good&quot; configuration from the &quot;Windows advanced options&quot; menu shown in the post. If that works you may get back to the 0x7e error, which we can fix.</p>

		                <p>jesper: chkdsk reports &quot;The volume appears to contain one or more unrecoverable problems&quot;, but not sure what else it says. It could be it&#39;s just saying that if it can&#39;t find the partition?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve no idea about RAID on it but I doubt it. It&#39;s just a consumer HP Pavilion as I understand it. A few years old I think. Although maybe it has SATA and needs a special driver, but I don&#39;t know the specs.</p>
<p>Problem is I&#39;ve only been able to diagnose this via the telephone.</p>

If removing SP3 helps I would say it is more likely a bad video driver. Can you check whether you are using an MS driver or an ATI driver for that video card?</p>

		                <p>Tim: That machine sounds pretty bad. There is clearly hard disk corruption, and if chkdsk can't fix it, I don't think much can. It almost certainly does not have RAID, and probably not an add-on SATA card either. It could just be that the hard drive is bad. </p>

		                <p>i&#39;ve installed XP SP3 on about 20 machines so far, both AMD and Intel, but i&#39;ve only had one with one of these problems. i got the &quot;A5&quot; stop error on an Athlon XP 1800+ machine. it pretty much killed it as far as i&#39;ve been able to see. swapped hard drives and it still gives the same error. can&#39;t re-install windows. nothing i&#39;ve found will work, but i will try plugging in a USB flash drive and seeing if that fixes it.</p>

		                <p>If I remember rightly, I had this with XP SP2, same issue but it got a lot further into the loading until it BSOD. ATITOOL installed whilst SP2 was installed killed it then. I wonder. But a BIOS Battery unplug, secondary hard drives removal, not good for MS this is it. System Restore doing it&#39;s thing right now. Will post the result in the next few minutes.</p>

<p>Open a command prompt (running as an administrator in case you run as a standard user normally)</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<p>reg query hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services\intelppm</p>
<p>Look at the value in the &quot;Start&quot; row. If you have an AMD based system it should say:</p>

<p>Or, you should get an error that the key does not exist. If either is true, you don't have the intelppm problem. </p>
<p>On an Intel-based system it will say 0x1. Do NOT set it to 0x4 on an Intel based system.</p>
<p>If you have an AMD based system and the Start value is set to anything other than 0x4, run this command:</p>
<p>reg add hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services\intelppm /t REG_DWORD /v Start /d 0x4 /f</p>

		                <p>Great job Jesper, thanks!</p>
<p>I had a 100% match of problem number two with an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe. Unfortunately the USB flash drive solution did not work at first. In fact the computer did not boot at all but shut it self off after a few seconds without ever activating the monitor. After removing all external hard drives (Firewire &amp; USB) but keeping the USB flash drive connected I was back to square one - repeated reboots. </p>
<p>After removing all other USB devices except the USB flash drive and hooking up an old PS2 keyboard I got the computer to boot. I then needed to reconnect the USB mouse in order to get past an automated updates activation screen which did not except keyboard input. After this the sp3 installation ran to completion and my computer appears to be back to normal.</p>
<p>Based on my experience it would seem that the sp3 installation needs to complete after an initial reboot and somehow ends up in a faulty state on some AMD-ASUS boards. This is by passed using the USB flash drive trick and after the installation completes the flash drive is no longer needed.</p>

		                <p>On Wednesday I installed SP3 from WU. &nbsp;It was on a HP rig w/AMD and OEM image. &nbsp;The reboot issue did in fact result. &nbsp;Safe mode failed to load the first two times it was attempted. &nbsp;Last known good config also failed. &nbsp;On a third try Safe Mode managed to load and System Restore succeeded in rolling back a day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This was on a friend&#39;s computer. &nbsp;I turned off Auto Updates for the time being as he would more than likely click the little yellow shield next time it popped up as he doesn&#39;t know a thing about &quot;techie&quot; stuff.</p>
<p>How many poor folks at home this week who have one computer that they bought with an AMD CPU because it was cheap and now it won&#39;t boot into Windows? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how quickly this gets ironed out.</p>

		                <p>Edward: your experience is interesting. You say that after the first boot you can boot without the USB flash drive? Are there any other USB storage peripherals attached? Others are reporting that you have to have the flash drive attached to boot succesfully. </p>

		                <p>I was a bit premature in my celebration - it appears that my computer will end up in constants reboots if I have anything connected to the USB ports. This is true for mouse (Logitech MX1000), keyboard (Logitech G15), webcam (Philips SPC900NC), built-in usb hub (DELL FPW2405) and label writer (Dymo LabelWriter 400) regardless of if these are used singly or in combination. With all USB devices disconnected the computer will boot with or without USB flash drive.</p>
<p>If I reconnect the devices after Windows has started and I am logged in the devices will be recognized and start working as they did prior to sp3 so the problem appears to be connected to when windows initiates the USB drivers during boot up.</p>

<p>Odd that your computer boots without the flash drive though. Do you have some other secondary storage device attached? There were reports that a secondary SATA device might help too. Maybe that is why your computer boots without the flash drive. </p>

		                <p>Just for my own two cents worth.</p>
<p>I have a 4 year old AMD 3200+ based HP Pavilion a645c with the following BIOS and MB:</p>
<p>Board: ASUSTek Computer INC. Kelut 2.02</p>
<p>BIOS: Phoenix Technologies, LTD 3.07 06/09/2004</p>
<p>When I first bought the thing I immediately wiped the HP imaged OS (XP Home) and loaded Windows XP Pro SP1 from a &quot;genuine&quot; MS XP Pro CD. After this I then installed SP2 with no problems.</p>
<p>2 months ago I reformatted and reloaded the same OS and SP2. Today, I installed XP SP3 RC2 Refresh (which ran with no problem) and let Windows Update upgrade the OS with SP3 final. Everything went fine and the old PC runs better than ever.</p>
<p>The point of this whole comment is that after reading your excellent post I did a search for both &quot;amdk8.sys&quot; and &nbsp;&quot;intelppm.sys&quot; and found that &quot;intelppm.sys&quot; exists but &quot;amdk8.sys&quot; is nowhere to be found (by the way, my serial number does not end in Z but it is most definitely an AMD based PC). Power Management works fine also.</p>
<p>Just another screwed up example for ya&#39;. :D</p>
<p>Thanks for the great info! Hope it helps those with the reboot problems</p>

		                <p>Had a similar problem on an Asus M2N32 WS Pro. It&#39;s got Sata raid mirrored disks on it, so I couldn&#39;t see the disk in repair mode. Acronis True Image version 10 could see them though, So I carried out a disk image backup on the network to a large disk on another computer, took 90 minutes for 24GB</p>
<p>I then resorted to fitting a single disk on the Marvel Sata connections and installed XP Pro on it, loaded the Sata drivers for the NVidea Sata Raid. set the &nbsp;options to allow me to see all the hidden files and folders, &nbsp;then set permissions on the &quot;System Volume Information&quot; to allow the administrator access, then go back few days on the RPxxx folders (view the date stamp) copy the &nbsp;SAM, SECURITY, software, default and system to Windows\tmp rename them from the long names to these correct ones. </p>
<p>Make backups of the ones already in Windows\system 32\config &nbsp;and then copy the ones from Windows\tmp to Windows\system 32\config</p>
<p>Now I had it working before I found this blog. So I didn&#39;t try the USB disk to see if it solved the problem. &nbsp;But I have a feeling I&#39;m going to see a few more to test it on.</p>
<p>I had also tried the following CD&#39;s to see if I could see the Sata Raid, Knoppix 3.3 no good, Knoppix 5.1.1 didn&#39;t get the screen right so couldn&#39;t see (old 1024 x 768, 72HZ monitor)? and PC Linux December 07 didn&#39;t pick them up either.</p>
<p>If anybody knows of anything or anyway that allows a bootable CD that supports Sata drives and file manipulation to solve the above problem I would &nbsp;appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>Thanks a million for the advice, Jesper.</p>

		                <p>Paul Brown: I don't think the Dell has the AMD-related problems. That machine is an older Intel-based laptop, isn't it? It does have an ATI video chip though as far as I know. Can you try booting into safe mode or VGA mode and see if that works? If it does, you have a video driver conflict. </p>

		                <p>Francesco: I have seen two machines so far, including yours, with the 0x00000074 message. It can mean a number of things, but possibly that you have a corrupted configuration. Try booting the Last Known Good using the F8 key as outlined in the post. See if that works. It could also be bad memory, some other bad hardware, or a number of other things. Try Last Known Good first, and if that doesn't work, try Safe Mode. That will tell us whether it is a driver or a corrupted registry.</p>

<p>Did SP3 install on 4 machines: 2 Intel based laptops, 1 Intel based desktop and 1 AMD based desktop. &nbsp;All went well EXCEPT the AMD machine. &nbsp;Sure enough, it is a custom job with an A8N32-SLI-Deluxe. &nbsp;Used the USB fix. &nbsp;took 3 cycles of reboots, but it finally worked.</p>
<p>What is of note is that I had a similar problem a couple of months ago with a Windows Update. &nbsp;Once again, only the AMD machine had the problem. &nbsp;Then, I was able to boot by telling it to roll back to the last Windows configuration that worked. &nbsp;(Not an option with SP3 update.)</p>

		                <p>Jesper,</p>
<p>Like Edward, I have an ASUS A8N32 SLI deluxe, but I have an Athlon 64 3500+. Nvidia video card. Boot disk is a WD 75Gig Raptor on the primary ATA port and a WD 250 gig drive on the Nvidia Serial ATA controller. </p>
<p>Prior to coming across the USB drive method, I had been unable to determine the error code and had tried replacing the rpcrt4.dll file I had read about in some threads. I had also gone into the BIOS (version 1303) and done a soft reset to default settings. Still no go.</p>
<p>Finally after reading this thread, I came home and tried the USB drive trick and still no go. After reading Edwards input, I removed all other external USB devices, left the flash drive connected and still no go. I decided to unplug the only remaining USB device, which was the mouse and connected with one of those USB to PS2 adapter plugs, and &quot;bingo!&quot; </p>
<p>The system came the rest of the way up and went to &quot;found new device&quot;, which was the Sil Raid controller. It was not being used and I had previously disabled it in BIOS to avoid the delay and error message on boot up.</p>
<p>After the boot up finished, I reconnected all other USB devices and confirmed all worked fine. I restarted the system without the flash drive and it came back up fine. I just realized that I also have a combo floppy/media player that connects to USB internally, so that has been connected the entire time, although there is no media in the reader portion.</p>
<p>I have not gone back into BIOS to set up the few custom things I had set previously. Due to the time of night, I&#39;ll continue tomorrow, but wanted to get some feedback out to others who are suffering.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for posting this and great information everyone! If I can provide any other information or feedback, let me know.</p>

		                <p>Learner: yes, some of these problems affect XP SP2, but only when you install SP2. At that point, the intelppm problem would occur just like with SP3, if your computer is subject to it. Media Center is not relevant as far as I can tell though.</p>
<p>So far I have not seen a single laptop with these problems. Every machine that has been confirmed affected has been a desktop as far as I can recall. What is your laptop doing? </p>

		                <p>Another data point. I couldn&#39;t sleep due to a cold (too much coughing), so I got up and decided to restore my BIOS settings to what they were before reseting them to default during the efforts to get back up.</p>
<p>I noticed that I still had the mouse plugged into the PS2 port, so I moved it back to the USB port it had been on originally.</p>
<p>No reboot! 0xA5 error returned. Plugging in a USB flash drive was still no help.</p>
<p>Moved the mouse back to PS2 port and all is well. I&#39;m only guessing that eventually there will be a BIOS update for the ASUS motherboard, or a fix will come out that restores my ability to run the mouse off of USB. Not sure that matters much to me, but it would be nice to be back where I was before the SP. I realize I could uninstall SP3 and be back where I was, but for now I plan to leave it installed and see if ASUS or Microsoft comes up with a patch to make it all better.</p>
<p>Good luck everyone! And thanks again for all the useful tips being posted.</p>

So I wanted to disable it beforehand, I read somewhere you can simply disable it by changing the start value of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\intelppm from 1 to 4. Problem is I don&#39;t have this regkey. Does this mean the service isn&#39;t running or what? I do have the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AmdK8 regkey. </p>
<p>Should I try the option to boot into safemode and disable intelppm the way you describe it?</p>

<p>You&#39;re joking right? - hardware failed just by conincidence after installing a new service pack? - I think you&#39;re dreaming. &nbsp;This might happen about once in every 10 million. &nbsp;Idiot.</p>

<p>After SP3 installation system was continously rebooting. Using a USB pendrive didnt help. Then I removed all USB (logitech G7 mouse and logitech G15 keyboard with internal usb hub) and boot completed normally. To finish SP3 installation i plugged in a PS2 keyboard. I replaced back G15 and G7 and again at boot windows crash, with or without a pendrive.</p>
<p>Playing a bit I found that is having the G7 mouse plugged in that crash the system, with or withouth the pendrive plugged in.</p>

		                <p>Just installed SP3 on Dell Optiplex 755 with Intell Q6600 and I&#39;m getting the endless Boot cycle.</p>
<p>Can&#39;t even boot into Safe Mode. I&#39;m Getting Stop error 0x000000FC.</p>
<p>After much fiddling, I have found that I can boot but only if I have no USB devices plugged in. Bit of a problem as that is the only way I have to attach keyboard and mouse. As soon as I plug them in the system restarts. Assuming USB drivers... but can&#39;t figure out how to get to them to fix them... any ideas??</p>

		                <p>Mother board is an ASUS A8N-SLI deluxe. Get ready for this one, it&#39;s unf**king real. I saw the reference about someone moving the mouse from a PS2 slot to a USB and then back. I had mine in a USB and moved it to a PS2. The only way I could get it to boot before was with a flash drive in and removing the flash gave me the endless reboot sequence. Moving the mouse port works. However if I move it back to the USB port I get the endless reboot problem. Which leaves me with the dilemma of not enough PS2 ports in the back of the machine, a minor problem and I will solve it later, I hope. I still have two free in the top of the case, but use it for the head set. Maybe Asus will get this fixed or whomever.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t messed within the BIOS setting (which I was always able to get into during the endless reboot) with the mouse selection set on [auto] and at this point in time I don&#39;t want to. It might be a needed option to check for someone else with this problem. I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up Jasper and Astout, I owe you a cup of coffee and a donut for this one. :)</p>

		                <p>This is a fundamental design booboo on Microsoft&#39;s part. &nbsp;The Operating system should decide to load these drivers at boot based on what chip they are running on, not at original OS install time.</p>
<p>I pity anyone with XP on an Intel processor who later upgrades their PC to an AMD motherboard.</p>
<p>A repair install off a slipstreamed SP3 CD should fix it, though, should it not?</p>

		                <p>Hi,</p>
<p>had a similar issue with the reboot but different resolution - hope it helps...</p>
<p>1) first issues was my keyboard wasnt working/allowing me to f8 or choose safeboot - nearly pulling my hair out until i realised that my swapping my keyboard from the new USB connection to the old PS2 connection gave me back control !</p>
<p>2) finally into XP safemode - tried looking for the intelppm as instructed, but it wasnt there so scatching head again... where do i find an error message when the PC just keeps rebooting and tells me nothing !!!</p>
<p>3) safemode again, right mouse clicked on &quot;my computer&quot;, looked up system properties &gt; advanced &gt;startup recovery... found &quot;system failure&quot; Auto restart and unchecked it.... did a restart...</p>
<p>4) wonderful, now instead of restarting i got a blue screen of death WITH ERROR MESSAGE ! nv4_disp</p>
<p>5) bit of soul searching and its an nvidia drive problem - went into safe mode and followed instructions from here <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.christopherjason.com/articles/nvidia-nv4disp-problem/">www.christopherjason.com/.../nvidia-nv4disp-problem</a></p>
<p>(apart from havnt re-installed driver yet as seems to work fine on the standard windows ones and until they release a newer one which fixes this i can live without !)</p>
<p>6) reboot and HEY PRESTO !!!! back in the IT age...</p>
<p>hope this helps others trouble shoot...</p>

<p>Happened to visit the blog bfr installing SP3...Have blocked automatic updates on my m/c for now after reading about the problems....</p>
<p>Was really great reading ur blog....</p>

So, yes, if it happens once in 10 million, you have 50 machines that just blew up when the service pack was installed. As it turns out, it is a bit more common than that. It happens every time a service pack comes out. </p>

		                <p>I just installed Ubuntu on a machine that the user installed SP3 on. His machine would not complete the boot process after installing SP3. To tell the truth, I think that his Windows version was pirated but I&#39;m not sure. I installed Ubuntu 8.04, and didn&#39;t even tell him it&#39;s not Windows. It&#39;s been a full day now, and so far no complaints. He was already using Firefox but I was expecting to hear complaints about Open Office. No complaints yet, but it is still early.</p>

		                <p>I operate an HP with XP Media Edition with SP2 installed. I installed SP3 and my computer crashed on restart. It continued crashing(I now know why). I was on the telephone with Microsoft for over 3 hours on May 7. They finally got my machine working. However, I could not get on line by any means. The next morning(May 8,2008) I was on the phone with MS again for 1 1/2 hours. Finally got on line after they said I had to remove the Free Zone Alarm from my computer. After removal I was able to get on line immediately. After things were working great I downloaded Free Zone Alarm again. My computer crashed again. This time I knew how to fix it and took Zone Alarm off again. Apparently, SP3, IE7, AMD and Zone Alarm don&#39;t work well together. </p>
<p>To make things clearer, I had disabled Zone Alarm BEFORE I downloaded SP3.</p>

		                <p>I have a custom-built A8N32-SLI Deluxe (AMI BIOS 1009 12/14/05) system with a Dual Core AMD Opteron 170 processor and two separate (no RAID configured) Maxtor 250GB SATA drives. &nbsp;I originally was running Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 (SP2) and attempted to update to SP3. &nbsp;My system hung right at the end of the SP3 installation, so I waited a long time in hopes that it would recover but eventually had to power it off. &nbsp;When I turned it back on it went into a constant reboot loop.</p>
<p>I decided to do a repair of the Windows XP installation. &nbsp;After the repair I was able to boot into Windows again so I attempted to re-install SP3 again. &nbsp;After that I was back in the constant reboot loop. &nbsp;At this point I found out about the &quot;Disable automatic restart on system failure&quot; option and when I tried that I got the ACPI a5 STOP error.</p>
<p>I upgraded my BIOS to the latest (1405) but that didn&#39;t help. &nbsp;I tried disabling various things in the BIOS, APM, USB, etc but that didn&#39;t help. &nbsp;I was able to get the system to boot once with APM disabled but then it didn&#39;t work again. &nbsp;I even did another repair back to SP2 but then I got the constant reboot loop even with just SP2.</p>
<p>After that I found this blog article and tried plugging in a USB flash drive. &nbsp;That didn&#39;t help. &nbsp;I also tried unplugging all USB devices and just using PS/2 keyborad and mouse, but that still didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Finally, I tried unplugging the 2nd internal SATA drive and that allowed me to boot. &nbsp;I now attemped to install SP3 again but the install failed. &nbsp;I don&#39;t see any errors in Event Viewer about the failure though.</p>

		                <p>Thanks Jesper&#39;s you put me on the right track</p>
<p>I did &nbsp;a clean install of windows xp service pack 1 OEM not the Mesh one as above and installed WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU from microsoft downloads on one hard drive only connected.Only installed min drivers sound video AMD cpu driver and Nvida nforce driver pack.Updated ok but when I restarted pc got the BSOD error as above.</p>
<p>If I press F8 as soon as pc boots I get a popup menu asking which device I which to boot then press Esc key then quickly press f8 then choose Disable automatic restart on system failure pc boots to desktop with no usb flash drive installed.</p>
<p>Ok update If I take out my microsoft comfort opitical mouse 1000 USB and put my Logitech Model M-CAA43 PS2 Mouse windows boots up to desktop ok.</p>
<p>If I try a USB to PS2 Adapter I get the BSOD again have not tried a full update as yet will try and report back.</p>
<p>This work around is only for the ACPI Compliant BSOD stop error code: 0x000000A5 and &nbsp;AMD Athlonª 64 FX-60 Dual Core</p>
<p>CPU or The ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe PCI-Express Mainboard - ATX.</p>
<p>A8N32-SLI Deluxe BIOS version 1303</p>
<p>File used for upgrade to SP3 WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU from microsoft downloads and Mesh OEM windows xp Pro.</p>
<p>Ok some good news and some bad if you config one Hard drive with Windows service pack3 with a PS/2 port Mouse XPS 3 will install and reboot fine with no usb flash drive or a usb hard drive.</p>
<p>But if you install XPS 3 one hard drive and then reenable the second sata drive then the second BSOD comes back and the only work around is to press F8 until the popup boot menu comes up and then press Esc button and quickly press F8 and then choose Disable automatic restart on system failure you have to do this everytime you restart or turn off pc.</p>
<p>I used a normal Microsoft USB Keyboard and USB Belkin Wireless network Adapter XP3 does not affect theses as far as I know.</p>

		                <p>Francesco: I really wish I could tell you how to fix your problem, but you do not have one of the ones I know about. 0x74 is a completely different error code. 0x74 means that you have a bad configuration database file, a portion of the registry, on your computer. You cannot solve that problem with any of the advice in the post. </p>
<p>If you have installed any new hardware I recommend you start by removing it. The error could be caused by bad hardware, notably, bad memory, according to this article: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326679">support.microsoft.com/.../326679</a>. Can you remove half the memory in the computer and see if that helps? </p>
<p>If that does not help, I think your best option is to do a repair of your XP installation. That will set you back a bit, require you to install new updates and software, but you can at least access your data that way.</p>

		                <p>Pat, I think you have a very different problem. Did you manually power off the computer during installation of SP3? If so, you may have received only parts of the service pack, which would cause the kind of corruption you are seeing. You may also be a good candidate for a system repair. If you boot from the XP disk you should be able to repair your installation. </p>

<p>Ok I found the error for the &nbsp;ACPI Compliant BSOD stop error code: 0x000000A5 and &nbsp;AMD Athlonª 64 FX-60 Dual Core and ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe PCI-Express Mainboard.</p>
<p>In my case it was the onboard network controllers</p>
<p>Marvell Yokon and Nvidia nforce network adapters.</p>
<p>I have two because I was using a wireless network adapter.I disabled both in the bios.If I left one enabled I never got the BSOD.</p>
<p>If you disable both in windows in Device Manager no errors.&quot;</p>
<p>Using the same main board. Asus A8N32-SLI Deluxe and I found your fix to be interesting. I had run into a problem sometime in the distant past and had disabled the Nvidia network before all this in the Device Manager. I have forgotten why, probably wasn&#39;t using it and it didn&#39;t like it, but don&#39;t recall for sure anymore. The Yukon has and is still enabled. We aren&#39;t using the same main chip, but mine is dual core AMD and the BIOS I am still using is the 1205 version. </p>
<p>........................................................</p>
<p>These are really bizarre fixes and for the life of me I would still be screaming well into the night in the general direction of Redmond if I had not been linked to Jesper&#39;s site from &quot;Tech Support Forum&quot; and saw Astout&#39;s mouse fix. Man what desperation will lead one to try and this still leaves me aghast at it all.</p>
<p>I have since installed SP3 on two other machines, both AMD chips, one an Asus board and the other an ASRock dual series and no trouble on either. This update does not like the A8N32-SLI Deluxe board at all. </p>
<p>I still am wondering how many have this kind of problem but can&#39;t get out on the net to see some possible things for a fix. Anyone care to bet how many calls to the local computer shops are being made?</p>
<p>I apologize for misspelling your name Jesper. Jasper is a type of stone that I had to deal with in a previous job and it still kind of sticks in my mind. And thanks again for getting this information out.</p>

<p>My computer is an HP/Compaq with an AMD 3800+ X2 CPU.</p>
<p>I ran the Command Prompt and it said</p>
<p>Start &nbsp; &nbsp;REG_DWORD &nbsp; &nbsp;0x1</p>

		                <p>Jesper...brilliant write-up thanks...I was going into panick mode and this guided me through.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running a home built Intel based pc:</p>
<p>Intel D875PBX, P4 3Ghz, 1G, ATI 9700, WD Raptor 74Gb.</p>
<p>I had an issue where as soon as I logged into my domain, my system rebooted displaying/reporting no codes...</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling...same thing, I tried installing SP2 over the top, twice and still no go, same issue.</p>
<p>I could log in under safe mode, so figured I would be able to sort it one way or the other. &nbsp;Tried to install install latest Catalyst drivers but they would not install in safe mode.</p>
<p>Booting into VGA mode did it, I checked the version of the drivers: 8.432 installed updated to latest (8.467). &nbsp;Rebooted and I&#39;m in &nbsp;albeit now back at SP2.</p>
<p>Not sure whether I should upgrade now that I got it working again...best left for a bit I think.</p>

<p>I am having a problem with xp sp3. I have an Abit in9 32max, running a quad core, I have partitioned my hard drive, In the first half i have vista 64 bit installed and on the second partition i HAD xp installed. I tried installing xp sp3 and it came up with a fatal error. After trying numerous attemps to rollback, i was left with the option to format, it would not let me in to safe mode and any time i went in to &quot;R&quot; console, it only gave me the option of c inwhich vista is installed. I am trying to do a full reinstall of xp, but every time i try it want me to install sp 3 . It also comes up with an error message A Disk read error occured, press crtl alt del toreboot and i notice that some of the characters on this screen are diffrent colours which seems very odd. I would like to be able to get xp sp2 back up and running on my other partition, any ideas please</p>

		                <p>Ok I found the error for the &nbsp;ACPI Compliant BSOD stop error code: 0x000000A5 and &nbsp;AMD Athlonª 64 FX-60 Dual Core and ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe PCI-Express Mainboard.</p>
<p>In my case it was the onboard network controllers</p>
<p>Marvell Yokon and Nvidia nforce network adapters.</p>
<p>I have two because I was using a wireless network adapter.I disabled both in the bios.If I left one enabled I never got the BSOD.</p>
<p>If you disable both in windows in Device Manager no errors.</p>
<p>Last install was successful so I thought write how I did may help others here.</p>
<p>Did clean install of windows xp Pro.</p>
<p>loaded defaults in bios.</p>
<p>Updated all drivers to latest out.</p>
<p>installed Norton Internet Security 2007 (but disabled when installing service pack 3 for xp).</p>
<p>Did a windows update and install everything except sp3.</p>
<p>put in a non USB mouse PS/2 port.</p>
<p>left Sata driver in bios enabled and had two hard drives installed.</p>
<p>Then got service pack 3 from windows updates.</p>

<p>PLEASE ask Microsoft and the major search engines to promote this page to the top of the pile for &quot;XP SP3 crash&quot; or similar. At the moment, forums regarding the beta of SP3 are all that come up. (Seems like the issue was known, which begs the question ...)</p>

		                <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Never use CHKDSK /R unless you are sure there are no physical errors on the drive.</p>
<p>Using CHKDSK /R (and CHKDSK from the XP Recovery Console) could seriously mess up the contents of the drive and make it far more difficult to resolve your STOP 0x24 errors.</p>
<p>If possible use CHKDSK /V from a WinPE based boot CD or use Safe Mode to do the same.</p>
<p>If you can see the errors are minor then issue a CHKDSK /V /F to fix them.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Simon</p>

		                <p>I have had this problem on 1/2 of the 6 computers that I upgraded. I have found no consistency regarding intel vs amd. Problem worst w/RC2. All had most current bios. Chkdsk /p was run a cmd prompt w/cd bootup prior to upgrade. An Inspiron 5300 cannont as yet be recovered by any of the suggested methods. Replacing the GDI32.dll yields a new errror: &quot;numerical crc check error , cannot continue.&quot; As for microsoft, this is incredibly sloppy work. I can&#39;t this didn&#39;t show up almost immediately on their test computers.</p>

		                <p>Just to put forward a different point of view - installed Sp3 on 30th April and have had absolutely no problems at all. (XP Pro on an intel processor) Have much sympathy for those with the HP AMD problems etc but surely shouldn&#39;t some of the vitriol being directed at Microsoft be redirected at the likes of HP for not setting up the XP installations correctly in the first place.</p>

		                <p>I have ATI&#39;s version 8.467 driver installed on my AMD Athlon HP computer with XP SP3.</p>
<p>I have not had a boot problems but my computer occasionally blue screens while watching a DVD. The message doesn&#39;t stay on the screen long enough for me to read it.</p>
<p>ATI&#39;s driver fills up the event log with various error messages. &nbsp;They are aware of the issue but tell you to just use the driver that your PC manufacturer provides because they do not support laptops.</p>
<p>After you install ATI&#39;s new driver, the Windows Update site provides the old driver as an update that you can optionally install.</p>
<p>I should also mention this is the second time I got the error 0x80092026 at the Windows Update website. I had to delete the registry key mentioned in KB 555374 ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555374">support.microsoft.com/.../555374</a> ). After I deleted this key, the Windows Update feature worked again. I never got a warning message that automatic updates were failing (even though they were). I had to go to the Windows Update site to find out.</p>
<p>If someone was writing malware, they could write that registry key to prevent the fixes for any exploits from being patched by Windows Update. The person from secure@microsoft.com who replied to my email did not understand this and instead referred me to technical support. Maybe someone else will have better luck convincing them that this is a problem.</p>

		                <p>I have noticed that there are other issues with sp3. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still related to the ASUS/AMD kombination or something else. This weekend I bought and installed Rainbow 6: Las Vegas 2 on my computer running sp3. And the game was unplayable at any setting with graphic artifacts and long delays etc. This despite having sufficient hardware to run the game (Nvidia 7900GT, 2Gb RAM, Athlon 64 X2 4200+, Raptor 150Gb). After uninstalling sp3 the game ran flawlessly. Currently sp3 is too unstable and flawed to be of any use to me.</p>

		                <p>Your blog was helpful, but my SP3 failed on an older problem with my A8N32-SLI. I thought I was having the same boot cycling problem others have had in spite of taking precautions. &nbsp;Looking more closely I had the 0x0000009C stop code. &nbsp;My A8N32 had an earlier problem where there were paging errors &nbsp;at boot time if CNQ (Native Command Queuing) is turned on. &nbsp;After some updates the system would not boot. The CNQ option can be turned off &nbsp;via the device manager menu selecting the appropriate IDE ATA/ATAPI controller. It looks as though SP3 may have enabled this feature and/or come up with a sequence of paging requests the hardware could not handle.</p>
<p>Also, I tried to uninstall SP3 in safe mode, but the uninstaller was not able to find a file.</p>

<p>During service pack 3 installation my system hung. &nbsp;I left it go hoping that it was just slow and went to bed after several hours hoping it would continue..but the morning...it was still frozen. &nbsp;Froze at the process checking portion toward the end of the service pack3 install. &nbsp;Had no choice but to reboot because I couldn&#39;t do anything else. &nbsp;Have tried the various solutions...but can&#39;t get past the lsass.exe error. &nbsp;My oem cd doesn&#39;t seem to have a repair option...it wants to reinstall and I&#39;d like to save my date. &nbsp;Used the ubcd4 to boot and try to restore to no avail. &nbsp;A friend also early on advised me of the ibmppm disable solution and done that... but didn&#39;t solve it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to repair from my oem disk..because the option on the hp oem disk sp2 doesn&#39;t give me the repair choice that I&#39;ve seen people talk about. &nbsp;I&#39;ve also heard some oem disks don&#39;t have that option . &nbsp;It does see a previous installation but offers only new install. &nbsp;Can I try to remove sp3 using the new post above and then try restore again using the ubcd boot disk?</p>

<p>Thanks for your great blog. &nbsp;You solved my SP3 update problem after I found your site on MS TechNet. I have a stock HP Pavillion a1130n (AMD processor) and I never had any problems with it until I installed the XP SP3 update on 5/8 and got the failure to boot problem. As I am no computer guru, I spent hours trying to figure out what went wrong. But once I found your site, your clear diagnosis of the &#39;intelppm.sys&#39; file problem in AMD PCs and your explanation of how to find the underlying error code and then disable the driver solved my problem (after only missing the &#39;space&#39; after &#39;=&#39; in the &quot;run&quot; command syntax first time around). This problem must affect many users, as HP has sold a lot of AMD machines.</p>

		                <p>I have a ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard, and got stuck with the BSOD about ACPI. &nbsp;I updated my BIOS (v1103 or something) to the lates *NON-BETA* verson, and that fixed everything.</p>
<p>(During my testing though, I disabled ACPI on the [old] BIOS, and instead of the BSOD I got a reboot about the time the mup.sys was loading... &nbsp;I forget now if I got a BSOD message with that one. &nbsp;Reenabling it got me the original BSOD again.)</p>

		                <p>Regarding the PS/2 mouse solution...</p>
<p>At the hardware level, all motherboards are still limited by legacy IRQ assignments for backwards compatibility reasons. &nbsp;All current motherboards allocate 4 IRQs for the PCI bus, including all PCI slots, the AGP slot, and all onboard PCI devices, including USB port controllers (up to 4!!! on one board), onboard sound, LAN, raid and secondary IDE/SATA controllers, and even onboard video. &nbsp;So, with only 4 IRQs to share, it&#39;s a crowded place and all the drivers have to play nice when they&#39;re forced to share and IRQ. &nbsp;Windows tries to hide all this ugliness with virtual IRQs, but there can still be problems if hardware (or its drivers) doesn&#39;t co-operate. Usually, the trouble makers are sound card drivers (Creative Labs is the worst) and video card drivers. &nbsp;Which IRQ (or more correctly IRQ line) each item gets is determined by the slot it&#39;s in or how it&#39;s hard wired into the motherboard, in the case of onboard devices. &nbsp;However, for legacy reasons, the PS/2 mouse port is treated differently. &nbsp;When you don&#39;t have a PS/2 mouse plugged in, no IRQ is assigned to the port. &nbsp;But when you plug one in, it&#39;s always assigned IRQ 12 (and doesn&#39;t share, to my knowledge) and all the other devices are bumped around to make room. &nbsp;This may explain why switching to a PS/2 mouse might work for some people. &nbsp;When stuff is bumped around, either the devices aren&#39;t butting heads over the same IRQ, or maybe windows has to re-detect devices when they&#39;re bumped around. &nbsp;The same logic may explain why people are seeing odd behaviour with external drives (usb, sata, etc) connected or disconnected.</p>

		                <p>Regarding the blue screens; have you have any experience with attaching your machine onto a debugger? It requires either a serial port, or a 1394 port (and a 1394 cable), and an install of Windows kernel debugger. You can get the software here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/installx86.mspx">www.microsoft.com/.../installx86.mspx</a></p>
<p>And there is instruction as part of the package on how to install and use it. Once you install and attached the debugger, boot your machine and it should break into the debugger with the 0xA5/0x24 bugcheck. There should be more information on the screen at this point that will provide hints as to what the bluescreen is about. If you paste the screen here i might be able to give some suggestions to the root cause.</p>
<p>cheers.</p>

		                <p>I have a ASUS A8N32-SLI with AMD FX60. The first SP3 install, it froze on the &quot;Performing Cleanup&quot; step.</p>
<p> After I reset, the C: drive was messed up, and I had to go to the recovery console, do a chkdsk, then it booted and tried to undo the install and went into the boot loop, it never would boot ok. I did an XP repair, &nbsp;+calls to MSFT India to activate my XP install. </p>
<p>Tried it again, and it froze again on Performing Cleanup during the install, but upon reset it detected that setup failed and cleaned up nicely.</p>
<p>I installed it ok on a different (newer) ASUS mobo with AMD I&#39;ve built and it worked fine.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t believe this got through testing. I&#39;m just going to wait until they fix it and deal with it MUCH later. I wasn&#39;t so desperate for SP3 that I&#39;ve got time to spend time messing around in safe mode, regediting and everything else just to use my PC.</p>

<p>I had some weird problem last year with random memory errors that only went away after disabling the legacy USB, and i&#39;m curious if the boot with USB flash fix might be somehow related. (ex: BIOS bug in USB code, which isn&#39;t triggered if we can get past the BIOS level USB detection, or having a USB disk device caused windows to unload the BIOS USB code and reload the normal windows USB drivers)</p>

		                <p>Thank you!!! As you suggested, in Safe Mode I ran &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot; and rebooted my computer and it worked! I can&#39;t thank you enough!

		                <p>Why do the whiners complain that&#39;s it&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s fault when it was HPs? Clearly HP screwed up by putting an Intel based image on an AMD system. This goes against Sysprep usage as it clearly states that Sysprep should not be used when putting an image on that was based on one architecture (Intel) on another (AMD).</p>
<p>As for the other whiners who are leaving Windows XP to switch to Linux or OS X? Good luck! There is less support in Linux for hardware [and software] and Macs are over priced and are buggy themselves.</p>

<p>I installed SP3 and received a &quot;Memory Error&quot;, then a reboot. &nbsp;SP3 said it had failed to install correctly, then Uninstalled itself. &nbsp;It then rebooted and tried to install Outlook Express!? &nbsp;It failed with a memory error and shutdown in order not to damage the PC. &nbsp;It did this a second time, then third attempt it booted up into Windows.</p>

		                <p>My homebrew PC died immediately after the SP3 update. &nbsp;AMD X2 3800 processor and MSI K8N Neo2 mainboard. &nbsp;It began by locking up while the boot progress bar was active. &nbsp;After many attempts to boot it into safe-mode unsuccessful, I ran a series of mainboard burn-in and memory tests from a bootable CD with no errors. &nbsp;Next, I decided to try and repair the Windows installation with the XP CD. &nbsp;That reports that both NTFS partitions on my 160GB SATA2 drive are gone, replaced with a single FAT one. &nbsp;Now I get the generic message: DISK BOOT FAILURE - INSERT SYSTEM DISK. &nbsp;The HD utilities on my Ultimate Boot CD don&#39;t work at all either, most crashing with an MCB chain error. &nbsp;I&#39;ve Googled that, but there isn&#39;t any info relating to my specific issue. &nbsp;So I&#39;m beginning to wonder if I&#39;ll ever be able to recover the data from it, even if I install XP on a new drive and use data recovery software on it. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

		                <p>I had this issue on my HP AMD Pavilion. &nbsp;M7100E. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great computer, the first one I ever purchased instead of building myself, and it&#39;s been solid since day one. &nbsp;SP3 did put it into the reboot loop. &nbsp;I booted into safe, used system restore and came back before SP3. &nbsp;A few days later I see this article. &nbsp;I dropped to command prompt, entered:</p>
<p> sc config intelppm start= disabled</p>
<p>then let windows update do my SP3 install. &nbsp;Installed no problems whatsover!</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, I am using media center through a Comcast cable box. &nbsp;Now, when I went to watch some HD channels, they blue out with a &#39;restricted content&#39; message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They worked fine before SP3, so I don&#39;t know what happened. &nbsp;The spurs game sucked last night, so nothing major, but I need to get it fixed asap, or system restore will have to work it&#39;s magic again.</p>

		                <p>Did not get reboots, or halts. I had it take an inordinate amount of time on the windows loading screen, and then the screen eventually went blank. Only way out was to press reset on the tower.</p>
<p>I went to add/remove programs and removed sp3 after several attempts at getting it to run. Rebooting after removing sp3 did not fix login problem. Fortunately I had created a recovery point before installing, so I rolled back to that point (took forever!) and rebooted. Still got the blank login screen. At that point, it was 2am and I said to hell with it and went to bed. </p>
<p>Next morning, powered up machine, same thing, so I tried something stupid. I moved the video cable to the other port on the video card and rebooted. It worked! I don&#39;t know why?! The only thing is that I had been struggling with getting the fglrx driver working in kubuntu 8.04 and had moved it a week ago.</p>
<p>Anyhow, system consists of Biostar M7VIK mobo, &nbsp;AMD XP2400 cpu, and ATI X1950pro AGP card, setup dual boot.</p>

<p>You are not the only one complaining of corrupted files. I think at this point, given the new free support option, you should call in for that. It ought to be extremely rare that a service pack installation causes this kind of file corruption. Could you have some malware on the computer that is causing it?</p>
<p>Asi</p>
<p>Try booting with an external drive attached. You almost certainly do not have the intelppm problem, given that you have a custom built computer. I would expect that you also have the file corruption issue.</p>
<p>Pat:</p>
<p>You do have the intelppm problem. Please try the work-around in the section entitled &quot;First problem, affecting AMD-based computers with OEM images&quot;</p>
<p>Romano:</p>
<p>I have not seen a problem with an Italian language installation yet, but I can't see why it would be any different. It would probably be safe to assume that, yes, it does affect it. </p>
<p>M4Gnu5:</p>
<p>Your post worries me. You have some serious partition table corruption. I don't think SP3 caused it. Could the tools you ran have corrupted it? The only way I know of to fix it would be to use low-level tools to manually rewrite the partition table. That area is a bit beyond my skill level though. </p>

		                <p>I have a HP Pavilion m7560n Minitower... Had this exact problem with XP sp3 last week ... Tried to call for tech support at Microsoft ... &quot;forget about it&quot; ... Sent 2 hours speaking to 7 different people in India and they wanted to charge me $79 to help fix the problem ... They also wanted to send me to HP because it was a factory installed verion of Windows Media Center 2005 Edition... They only wanted $50 to help solve the problem ... Nobody indicated that there was even a problem ... Bottom line... &nbsp;no solution from India or HP and I had the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my life ... Ended up doing a total system recovery and downloading my backup files ..Everything is back working and nothing lost only the time spent setting up my computer again ... I will not download XP sp3 until I have more confidence in the system reboot issue ...</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t installed SP3 yet, but it&#39;s good to know I can come back to this page in case I need further help.</p>

		                <p>Below is the problem I had. &nbsp;I put in a usb flash drive and can now reboot. &nbsp;Going to try and take SP3 off my system.</p>
<p>Microsoft - when will I ever learn.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, I do not know for sure why this is happening, and I have not personally seen it. The people that have seen it seem to all have custom built AMD computers. Possibly, it is related to computers with the ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard, and possibly some others too, in them. Several different AMD processors have been fitted on that board, however, so it seems more likely to be the board than the processor. </p>
<p>The solution is simplicity itself: insert a USB flash drive, or some other form of secondary storage mechanism, before booting the computer. The people have that have seen this problem report that it goes away when they do. The catch is that the computer will only boot with a secondary drive attached. If you remove the secondary drive it will no longer boot. &quot;</p>

		                <p>All that&#39;s great but what should I do if I have not yet installed SP3 and want to keep from having this problem when I do install it? And my AMD HP desktop computer does not seem to have the amdk8.sys file only the intelppm.sys file. I&#39;d rather have a preemptive solution than a dead in the water one. Thanks!</p>

<p>I found that by disabling the COM Port, the Paralell Port, the Game Port, or the MIDI port in the BIOS allows the PC to boot. &nbsp;It&#39;s like there is an IRQ conflict causing system hault that wasn&#39;t a problem on SP2</p>

		                <p>Mine crashed too. Have a Compaq running MCE 2005, 2nd rollup, AMD 64 5400+. I tried the update twice and had to reboot in safe mode and do a system restore. After going to windowsupdate a few times it finally started downloading individual updates...86 in all! Why do you need all the same updates all over again? SP3 said it was just a cumulative update, what&#39;s the point?</p>
<p>Blame whoever you want, point is that this was an avoidable problem. </p>

<p>Yes. &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t agree more. &nbsp;In fact, it should be UNTHINKABLE that a service pack causes corruption. &nbsp;Sadly, I had this experience with Windows 3.x, Windows NT, and Windows XP (I managed to avoid ME). &nbsp;I started in IT in the mainframe days, when damaging the system was a hanging offense.</p>

<p>Yes, you are totally right. If you have a managed environment, then reimaging troubled systems is absolutely the right way to go. I've even gone so far as to say that troubleshooting of managed systems, beyond 5 minutes, is a waste of time. You should have facilities in place to prevent any data loss (network storage) and just reimage. </p>
<p>The same holds for Automatic Updates. In a managed environment, you should not let updates automatically deploy to systems without first ensuring that they are stable and compatible with your environment.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the computers that we have seen crashing after deploying SP3 so far are not managed systems. They are home systems. The HP AMD-Based computers are largely aimed at consumers and some small business users. The ASUS motherboards are aimed at enthusiasts who build their own computers. There may be some other problems that affect BigIT. Notably, the interaction with the ATI video drivers is still unclear, as is the reason for the disk/file corruption. However, so far, I think it is safe to say that BigIT has not seen the problems that the consumer and small business segment has. That is troublesome because consumers do not know where to go for help more often than not. </p>

<p>You have the file corruption problem. Try following the advice under &quot;other STOP errors&quot; above. Notably, it may work if you boot to VGA mode. If that does not work, I would call the Microsoft support line above. They can walk you through troubleshooting it. </p>

<p>At some point, you will have to either get SP3 or go to Vista to keep getting updates. However, that is a long way away, and if SP2 is working for you right now I would suggest you stay there, make sure you have the security updates, and let the dust settle. Ordinarily I would say you should upgrade to the service back faster, but right now I have a hard time saying that. </p>

<p>You guys done any benchmarks on SP3? &nbsp;Can I expect any performance gain (as reported in some site)? &nbsp;I have an Athlon XP 1800+ on a Soltek nforce2-400 board. &nbsp;Seems to me that&#39;s the only reason I&#39;d want to risk and apply SP3 right now.</p>

		                <p>I have SP3 installed with no problems. I even took the risk of not backing up my system like I usually do, because I am so behind in organizing all my data before a backup. I had the SP3 setup hang at the &quot;Creating restore point&quot; step. I even had to force a reboot of the computer after forcing a kill for the setup process. I thought I had ruined my computer, but the installation never started so I just tried again and it ran with no problems.</p>

<p>After SP3 it goes into a reboot cycle with a stop error, which I believe is A5. &nbsp;I can&#39;t get it to slow down enough to display clearly. &nbsp;In the BIOS I disabled both Ethernet controllers, the Firewire and the sound card. &nbsp;The mouse and keyboard are both PS2, there are no USB devices of any sort connected. &nbsp;Still cycles in a reboot. &nbsp;If I plug in a Flash drive and try to reboot, the BIOS stops saying &quot;Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key&quot;.</p>
<p>The disks are arranged in an nVidia RAID 1 array so I can&#39;t disable one disk.</p>
<p>Any suggestions at this point?</p>

		                <p>Responding to several posters:</p>
<p>FarCry: you have the file version issue discussed above under other problems. However, in your case it is not a critical OS file that is corrupted. I do not know what could be causing that, but it seems suspicious. Have you run a full malware scan on that system any time recently? I would be very curious for the result. </p>
<p>Stephen Rimington:</p>
<p>The most I can tell is that Microsoft is aware that there are problems. How long it will take to do anything about it, if it does anything at all, is anyone's guess. </p>
<p>Mike O'Brien:</p>
<p>You definitely have the problem with that ASUS motherboard. What happens if you plug in the flash drive and then force the BIOS to boot from the RAID array? Alternatively, can you get a USB mouse/keyboard and try with that? Perhaps someone else with a similar setup can give you additional pointers.</p>

		                <p>Actually this problem is a subject for a collective court case against MS, who is treating its customers, who have paid for the system and expect updates to improve it and not waste their time to restore it, and in worst cases, restore their files (!). They simply did not test the update on a variaty of PC configurations, though their budget allows doing it, and what about the beta testing procedures - I cannot believe no of the thousands of MS testers spontted the issue</p>

		                <p>Well, that was interesting. &nbsp;The Apple USB keyboard and mouse allowed the system to boot, finally! &nbsp;More fiddling with the BIOS, keyboard and mouse shows that there&#39;s a BIOS Boot option to enable/disable/auto the PS/2 mouse. &nbsp;The system will only boot if the PS/2 mouse is disabled or not present. &nbsp;I must, for now, run the system with a USB mouse.</p>
<p>This is something of a pain because the system&#39;s actually connected to a PS/2-style KVM switch. &nbsp;I&#39;m going to have to keep an extra mouse floating around just for this box, it seems, unless and until Microsoft figures out what they did in SP3.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help! &nbsp;At least, with some kludging, I&#39;ve got a working system again. &nbsp;But something&#39;s still very, very wrong in there, at some fundamental level. &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s going to come back and bite me.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the screen shot I get. &nbsp;After trying to make contact via a PS2 keyboard and mouse I get another message that says the keyboard is locked and to unlock it. I have never locked it and not even sure I have a lock on the PC. &nbsp;It is a MESH.</p>
<p>I am thinking about removing the HDD and linking it to a laptop to disable the offending file. Is this viable?</p>
<p>Many thanks for you help it saves this PC from landfill.</p>

		                <p>One of our users has an Optiplex GX260 that blue screens with the 7E error. Intel CPU so not the AMD issues. Checked to make sure no AMD equivalent to intelppm as you suggested to another commenter, and found nothing. NVidia video card, not ATI. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve told him that aside from being time to retire that PC, a reload is the only fix at this point. Still, this makes us hesitant to roll out the update and/or recommend our users do the same on their home PCs.</p>

		                <p>Jesper: You can&#39;t really say to stick with SP2 permanently. After all, with SP3 available, Microsoft will surely discontinue SP2 support in under 2 years and SP3 will be manditory to get [by then] security fixes.</p>
<p>Instead, maybe stick with SP2 but will either go with SP3 if the system gets unstable later on - or the user buys a new PC!</p>

<p>Is the computer giving you any more information on the error? Is it complaining about a specific file? Can you try booting in VGA mode? That would tell you if it is the video driver that is the problem. There are some walk throughs on troubleshooting that error here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330182">support.microsoft.com/.../330182</a>. I have not seen many of those on Intel-based systems yet, so I don't think it is a common problem like the AMD one.</p>

<p>No, I am absolutely not saying to stick with SP2 permanently. It will have to go away, and supposedly, SP3 works really well for the vast majority of people. The one thing right now that bothers me is this file corruption issue. If only I knew what that was I would feel a lot better about broadly deploying SP3.</p>

		                <p>I have avira antivir classic edition. I am going to do a full scan plus a rootkit scan and then i am going to do a scan with spybot and a-squared free edition. I will report the results and inform you if I find something suspicious.</p>
<p>But it is rather strange because removing SP3 solves the problem by reinstalling the backup files that SP3 stored into the Servicepackfiles folder under C:\windows </p>

		                <p>I have read at The Register the following comment</p>
<p>&quot;I have found that the problem does NOT exist if one downloads the 554MB .ISO file and then burns the .ISO to a CD,Ó he said. ÒFollowing that, installation of Windows XP SP3 has no problems EVEN ON AMD PROCESSOR based machines. If one uses the online update to Windows XP SP3 or the 316MB installation file then problems will arise.&quot;</p>
<p>I am going to give it a try after removing SP3 to install it from the ISO file again. Maybe this will correct my problem. I have already tried installing SP3 by using windows update (70MB) and by executing the 316MB installation file. I will try the ISO method to see if it will make wonders</p>

<p>I have an A8N32-SLI Deluxe-based computer I built myself - installed (legal!) OEM WinXP SP2 on an AMD Athlon x64. &nbsp;Note this is 32-bit Windows though.</p>
<p>After SP3 it goes into a reboot cycle with a stop error, which I believe is A5. &nbsp;I can&#39;t get it to slow down enough to display clearly. &nbsp;In the BIOS I disabled both Ethernet controllers, the Firewire and the sound card. &nbsp;The mouse and keyboard are both PS2, there are no USB devices of any sort connected. &nbsp;Still cycles in a reboot. &nbsp;If I plug in a Flash drive and try to reboot, the BIOS stops saying &quot;Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key&quot;.</p>
<p>The disks are arranged in an nVidia RAID 1 array so I can&#39;t disable one disk.</p>
<p>Any suggestions at this point?</p>
<p>I had this problem try this In the bios enabled both Ethernet controllers and the Firewire disable the raid to disabled.</p>
<p>press F8 as boots up as quickly as possible a bootup menu should come up and Press Esc key and then F8 quickly and your get the &quot;Disable automatic restart on system failure&quot; option if that don&#39;t work then try safe.</p>
<p>Do this at your own risk as your going to loast your raid setup.But this should let you get into windows in safe mode as admin rights and If you got syslem restore enabled can remove Service pack 3.</p>
<p>If the above does not work then get hold of a the one I used was 4gig but shows up as 2x2gig usb flash drive.</p>
<p>Use a USB keybroad and a PS/2 mouse Logitec rollerball.</p>
<p>Then try the F8 and Esc on boot up to get to the &quot;Disable automatic restart on system failure&quot; option in the Advance safe mode setup.</p>
<p>Works on A8N32-SLI Deluxe-based with bios version 1303.</p>

After trying a 160MB-USB-Drive and an additional 250MB-SATA-HD, which both allowed to boot the system, i figured out, that replacing the file &quot;ntldr&quot; with the old one from SP2 solved my problems - the system boots from the internal 1TB-SATA-HD with or without any additional drive.</p>

		                <p>Thanks so much for generously sharing this information. &nbsp;You saved me from a lot of frustration. &nbsp;I have 3 HP Pavilion AMD desktops, and I was anxious about SP3 upgrade. &nbsp;Fortunately, I read your blog that led me to prepare my HP desktops prior to the upgrade. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if I had to but I modified all intelppm Start entry to 4 in all ControlSet\Services under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\. &nbsp;Then I ran the upgrade which was successfull for all 3 HP desktops. &nbsp;Again, thanks for your advice. &nbsp;I also found MS KB888372 useful.</p>

		                <p>Installed sp3 on my AMD Duron, KT266A Northridge Chipset, Ultra DMA with brand-new WD hard drive(clean), 137+GB. I had just loaded SP2 on my computer and SP3 was automatically downloaded as a update. Asked to reboot system. When I clicked on the reboot now link, I recieved the blue screen of death.</p>
<p>After restarting computer and @ initial rebooting of my console, I recieved the following error at the time of system startup:</p>
<p>BIOS ROM checksum error</p>
<p>Detecting floppy drive A media...</p>
<p>INSERT SYSTEM DISC AND PRESS ENTER</p>
<p>The BIOS copyright notice is loaded before this error. I cant enter the SETUP menu at all to change the boot drive back to my HDD or CD rom. I had previously removed my floppy drive years ago, but after I first recieved error message I went ahead and reinstalled it. I dont have any recovery discs, other than my CD bootdisk and XP home install disks for Home and SP2. No Flops for system boot. Am not sure what to do next. </p>

		                <p>I think Krick has nailed the problem with most of the ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe boards, get XP, after the install, to assign/look at new IRQ&#39;s or do what ever it does with them. It&#39;s the only thing that makes any sense why moving the mouse (keyboard other devices?) around would make any difference. It would be interesting to understand why the flash drive will work for some of us, but when unplugged again goes into the endless reboot again, at least on mine. I would think it has to be related to this, but only a temporary rather then a more permanent IRQ switch? But my guess is if you have this board, try anything to make it rearrange the IRQ&#39;s. And like I said in my first post the mouse in the BIOS was set to auto detect (and still is) and if I get this problem again, I just wonder what setting the option to something else and then back again would do.</p>
<p>I did a check disk run today. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had any fix corrupted files before, but I did this time. I knew I should have written the damn file down, sorry. But I can&#39;t be sure this is in any way related either.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve yet to hear anything back from ASUS about this, but directed them here for a look see. Maybe they ignored me as I was too lazy to look up all the info they want when sending them a simple note to pay attention to the real world. Maybe we&#39;ll get a new BIOS out of them out of all this mess, that would be nice, all listed are very old.</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper ---</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an odd one. &nbsp;We had the SP3 reboot issue upon installation with one of the machines here at work --- a 5-year old AMD Athlon brewed up for us by a local computer shop. &nbsp;Tried all of the tricks, to no avail. &nbsp;As a last gasp, IT installed a new power supply to see if that would affect the behavior of the computer in any way. &nbsp;It now works!! (4 days and counting...)</p>

<p>document viewer. &nbsp;this is most likely caused by the driver for a HP 6300 series all in one. &nbsp;The solution is to uninstall the software and reinstall as if the printer is new install. &nbsp;Disconnnect the printer during un install and connect when software looks for it as it would for a new printer install. &nbsp;This might work for other HP printers where you get this problem</p>

		                <p>Well I am finally getting a small bit of performance from SP3 on my Gigabyte GA-K8NSC-929 with an ATI 9800 video board.</p>
<p>I downloaded the SP3 iso file and burned it to a cd that the sick PC would still not boot or recognize. I finally got around this by copying the file to a second drive and unpacking it with WinRaR. I then ran the Upgrade several times with all the background apps turned off AntiVirus, Spybot, etc (of course).</p>
<p>Jesper - One remaining serious problem seems to be the inability to get ATI drivers that work. I downloaded 8.4 from the AMD/ATI site and went through the complete uninstall/reboot/install process and the machine still complains with an ATI error message that the drivers are missing. My screen is a 640x480 medium res with no options to change.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks a million.</p>

<p>I think several people have had problems with those ATI drivers. There are some third (fourth?) party drivers that seem to work better. Alternatively, an older version of the Catalyst drivers seems to have less problems. Troll through the comments and the newsgroup thread linked in the post and you should find the reference.</p>

		                <p>I have a ATI Radeon 7000 installed in a Intel system. On first boot, after SP3 installation, Windows halts with a 0x0000007e error. I can&#39;t boot on safe mode. The only way to recover to previous situation is to do a &quot;batch spuninst.txt&quot;, you know.</p>
<p>After complete the uninstall using spuninst.exe, I have removed all ATI drivers, and tried again to install the SP3. The result was the same, so I think that maybe it is not a problem of the drivers you have already installed in your system.</p>

		                <p>After installing SP3, Catalyst Control Center will no longer run. I try to reinstall it, and then CHKDSK pops up during startup and finds several errors, then reboots the pc. After that, suddenly I got a CMOS ERROR: BIOS DEFAULTS RELOADED upon reboot. I&#39;m at a loss as for what I should do, but this is a system that has run stable for years before installing SP3, so it would be a really unfortunate coincidence if this is just due to hardware failing.</p>

		                <p>My HP / Compaq SR1519 AMD64 3200+ WinXP Home SP2 desktop PC went into the endless reboot cycle last Wednesday, after loading SP3 from Windows Update.</p>
<p>Thanks to info on MS Technet and your blog, I later changed the registry key to disable the Intelppm.sys before successfully installing SP3 from CD.</p>
<p>Although this PC is years beyond any warranty, I emailed HP to warn them and to ask them to put information about SP3 on the HP support web-site.</p>
<p>The HP tech.s replied but gave silly, inaccurate, wrong answers. I tried twice more but with the same result.</p>
<p>This PC has now two versions of the Intelppm.sys file: Presumably Intelppm.sys version 5.1.2600.5512 was loaded by SP3 but there is an Intelppm.sys ver. 5.1.2600.2180 in the $NTservicepackuninstall$ folder. (No other service packs or beta versions have been loaded onto this PC.)</p>
<p>This AMD PC was supplied with WinXP Home SP2 pre-installed by HP. So, presumably, the Intelppm.sys ver. 5.1.2600.2180 file was installed by HP?</p>

		                <p>Yesterday evening I downloaded SP3 to my Compaq Pressario desktop with AMD and of course afterwards the system would not boot. Using another computer and &quot;googleing&quot; I found your blog. Being not so confident in navigating the various steps to fix the problem, I called the MS 800 number mentioned. MS was very polite and although I had to wait some considerable length of time to be connected to a technician, the wait was worth while. The technician was extremely helpful and walked me through each step until the problem was fully resolved. The problem was the ippm 4.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say thank you for your part in getting me set off in the right direction. Otherwise I would have been completely lost!! Again many thanks</p>

<p>Donald: No, SP3 is not currently rolled out via Automatic Updates, so unless you have manually checked for updates, it will not install that way. You would only get it if you go to Windows Updates.</p>
<p>Joe R: </p>
<p>What exactly is Auto Updates trying to install? Microsoft released a slew of new updates yesterday. Are you sure it is not them? SP3 should not be rolled out via Auto Updates at the moment. </p>
<p>Richard-S:</p>
<p>The $NTServicePackUninstall$ folder contains backups of all the files that were replaced when you installed the service pack. If you uninstall the service pack it would put those files back into their original locations. If you have the intelppm.sys driver sitting there it would stand to reason that it was there all along. </p>

<p>You need to give us more detail to help you. What error message are you getting? Have you tried booting into the recovery console?</p>

<p>Morten A and Rollin Honn, </p>
<p>Are those machines running with the HP image or with a custom OS image that you created? What type of machines are they? Your results are the opposite of what I was expecting to see. </p>
<p>Dan Kaup and GizmoKSX:</p>
<p>That is exactly the result I was expecting. You have the instruction to load the intelppm driver in the registry, but the file is not on the computer. If your result is the norm it means HP is right that the service pack lays down the file even if it weren't there.</p>

		                <p>Thanks for the reply, jesper. &nbsp;You may very well be correct, though I can&#39;t say for sure. &nbsp;I am hoping that a new HD and XP installation will gain me access to at least some of the data on the corrupted drive with recovery software. &nbsp;Do you have any thoughts regarding this route? &nbsp;Also, if I repartition the drive to it&#39;s original configuration (ie Partition #1: 16.384GBs, &nbsp;Partition #2: Remaining GBs, both NTFS), will I have any better success at a recovery? &nbsp;I realize that this isn&#39;t exactly the proper channel to be going off-topic regarding my HD recovery ideas, but I&#39;m between a rock and a hard place. &nbsp;I&#39;m a photographer who through lack of a backup plan lost 8 years worth of photographs that can never be replaced. &nbsp;If I could afford to, I&#39;d send the drive off to a professional firm for recovery. &nbsp;Thank you for any advice you have.</p>

<p>I really feel for you. I really do. To be perfectly honest, I would not touch the drive if I were you. Do yourself a favor and send it off for professional recovery instead. There is a possibility that you will get some data back if you try it yourself, but I think the risk is too great. </p>

		                <p>Jesper, I am having no trouble at present after installing SP3(build 2600) on HPdx2250 2.4Ghz Athlon64. A different worry though, Belarc Advisor insists I am missing 5no Security updates Q931906, 946974, 946983, 947590 and 947801. Windows Update says I am missing nothing. When I use any link to Knowledge Base, I am told &quot;IE cannot display page etc etc&quot; or I get a blank page in Firefox, which M$ won&#39;t allow in. I also put IE7 in to access M$ Update etc but use Firefox usually. IE7 won&#39;t display page from link to Knowledge Base on this page either. I am only happy that I am not in the middle of nowhere on a computer that keeps rebooting.</p>

<p>The hard drive may be shot, but I would be more inclined to look at the partition table. Were you running any kind of anti-malware on that computer? If so, what kind, and are you sure there was no malware on it?</p>

		                <p>I&#39;m having trouble with a Dell GX620, as Brent Curtiss did. These use Intel Pentium, not AMD. But my stop error is 0x0000007E, same as those having the AMD problem. It won&#39;t boot to &quot;last good configuration&quot; and it won&#39;t boot to safe mode either. Same stop code when I try either one. </p>
<p>The odd thing is, it installed ok on another GX620. Some differences--</p>
<p>The one where it went ok, I installed from Windows Update. The other one I installed from a flash drive with the self-extracting file WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe on it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The good install was on my own PC, which automatically boots to an administrative user, and doesn&#39;t have the security settings we use on the public computers at our library. The one that failed boots to a limited account with lots of group policy settings and writing disabled to certain drives and folders. I don&#39;t know if that makes a difference--I installed it on a couple of public-use GX745&#39;s and they didn&#39;t have any problems.</p>
<p>Thanks for the many tips in your article--I&#39;ll be working through them.</p>

		                <p>We now have experienced the reboot problem twice - once on an HP and once on an Intel whitebox. &nbsp;However, once reconfiguring the boot process to display the stop errors, in both cases it has been the following:</p>
<p>Stop: C0000139 The procedure entry point GdiGetBitmapBitsSize ......failure in GDI32.DLL</p>
<p>Their are two ways to fix this:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Go into recovery console</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the system32 subdirectory and rename the existing GDI32.dll file</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, copy the GDI32.DLL file from c:\windows\ServicePackFiles back to the Windows\System32 subdirectory and reboot</p>
<p>If the GDI32.DLL file does not exist in the ServicePackFiles subdirectory, as it did not in my second case (which was my own dang machine at work) Then you will have to do the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Get copies of the GDI32.DLL files from a working machine from both the Windows\System32 subdirectory AND the Windows\System32\DLLCACHE subdirectory. &nbsp;You HAVE to have both. &nbsp;This is required because of the File Protection mechanism. The version .3264 fixed my issues.</p>

<p>To be honest, I cannot tell you if they run on a HP image or a custom image.</p>
<p>The machines are shipped from HP, but they come with Vista, and since we have not yet started to use Vista, a third-party company reinstall the machines with XP (SP2).</p>
<p>The question here (which I will pursue tomorrow) is where they got the image.</p>

		                <p>People are reporting that they cannot boot into Safe Mode to bypass the endless reboot cycle: Perhaps their PCs are just working very slowly?</p>
<p>Until my HP / Compaq AMD PC was struck by this SP3 problem, I&#39;d seldom used Safe mode, but don&#39;t remember problems entering it.</p>
<p>After installing SP3, this PC has been very, very slow to enter Safe Mode:</p>
<p>On the first try, it was ages before the Safe Mode login screen displayed the available accounts. I used ctrl+alt+del and other things while trying to &quot;wake it up.&quot;</p>
<p>On later tries, it has taken about 10 minutes after clicking on the &quot;admin&quot; account before &quot;Safe Mode&quot; boots and displays its &quot;warning: Safe Mode&quot; info message.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand why it is now so slow. But seeing no activity, people could easily think that Safe Mode is not working.</p>
<p>Otherwise, my AMD64 3200+ PC is now running SP3 smoothly.</p>
<p>Eventually, I&#39;ll have to do a complete re-format &amp; reload of WinXP &amp; SP3 to clear all the broken backup files.</p>

		                <p>I have a custom built PC running an AMD CPU and chipset. &nbsp;The Mobo is a Chaintech ZNF3-250. &nbsp;XP-Pro was loaded from an HP disk belonging to a &quot;dead&quot; PC in my closet. &nbsp;I checked my C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers file and found the Intelppm.sys file present. </p>
<p>I simply renamed it Intelppmold.sys before downloading SP3 last night. &nbsp;I had no problems rebooting once the upgrade was finished. &nbsp;Since the file is not used on an AMD machine, I thought I would just leave it renamed, but WINDOWS in it infinite wisdom [or the ServicePack update] recognized the file was missing and added a new Intelppm.sys file to the drivers folder.</p>
<p>The fact that I was able to rename the file is probably indicative of the fact it was not loaded in registry, but what the hey! &nbsp;I had no problem. &nbsp;The fact that the file was restored during the update seems to be a MS &quot;problem&quot; if you choose to look at it in that light.</p>
<p>Either way, I squeeked by with no adverse actions.</p>

<p>Just installed SP3 on Dell Optiplex 755 with Intell Q6600 and I&#39;m getting the endless Boot cycle.</p>
<p>Can&#39;t even boot into Safe Mode. I&#39;m Getting Stop error 0x000000FC.</p>
<p>After much fiddling, I have found that I can boot but only if I have no USB devices plugged in. Bit of a problem as that is the only way I have to attach keyboard and mouse. As soon as I plug them in the system restarts. Assuming USB drivers... but can&#39;t figure out how to get to them to fix them... any ideas??</p>

<p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;I havent tried it yet but I have found something about copying the usbport.sys usbohci.sys and usbuhci.sys files but have not had a chance to try it yet. &nbsp;Of course I can boot into recovery using a winxp sp2 disc but I cant copy using that.</p>

		                <p>Had two machines (Dell with Intel p4 and generic computer with an AMD) crash with BSOD after SP3. The error pointed to problem with GDI32.dll I couldn&#39;t boot into safe mode so I used WinPE disk and when I got it running I copied GDI32.dll from servicepack directory to system32 and presto the problem was fixed. Ihave installed sp3 on another half dozen machines with no problems. Oh, and to the boneheads that are mouthing off about Microsoft, why don&#39;t you wait and see where these problems come from first. There are a lot of problems with HP putting an IntelPPM key to load itself when it&#39;s an AMD. The service pack checks the key and provides the driver as it should. That&#39;s certainly HP fault and I have had many a problem with HP machines and their non-standard pre-loads.</p>

		                <p>I am running an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe 4000+. If I disconnected the mouse (Razer Diamondback), it would boot. Uninstalled sp3. Still had the same issue. Tried a restore point from a week ago. It would still not boot if the mouse was plugged in. I tried plugging in a usb drive and that also did not work. Re-installed sp3 in safe mode. It had the same problem. Noticed that my keyboard took forever to initialize with the mouse plugged in. (Unable to access bios or F8 screen unless I got the BSOD). If I disconnected the mouse no lag. Disabled usb 1.1 support in bios. BIG MISTAKE sort of. I was unable to use the keyboard or mouse. Dumped the bios and reconfigured. Now it boots normally and I have no problems. All settings are the same as before as best as I can remember. I will continue to test and see if I can find the culprit. </p>

<p>There is some kind of bad driver on your computer. Would it be possible to boot without the peripherals, into safe mode, and then run an anti-malware scan from there? </p>

		                <p>Following on from my other post. As I noted, I recovered my HP-AMD after installing sp3, and there was no intelppm.sys in \system\drivers. Immediatly after I reinstalled sp3, the file appeared. So, MS sp3 certainly installs that bad driver. I rekon the reason some systems here show the driver prior to sp3 is probably because MS installed them in say, sp2. The default system recover certainly does not.</p>

<p>Could it be that the ones faced with the &quot;A8N32SLI DELUXE motherboard&quot; reboot problem after installing SP3, that they have configured their hard disks in a RAID configuration? Could that be part of the problem? Because I have the problem and my OS (XP pro) is running with a STRIPE (RAID0) configuration...</p>

		                <p>On 5/14/2008 I used Windows update to install SP3 on a Compaq S5000J and a Compaq S3010CL-B. Both machines are from 2003. Both have AMD processors with AMDK7.sys drivers. I felt reasonably comfortable since I had the information from here and I had just refreshed the Acronis TI backups of the machines.</p>
<p>Prior to the update, both of them had intelppm.sys files in the C:\Windows\System32\Drivers directory. Neither of them had an Intelppm entry in HKLM\System\CurrentControl\Services.</p>
<p>I believe that someone indicated that they had this situation (although probably with a K8 processor) and had a problem with the update. I believe they indicated that an Intelppm entry was created in HKLM\System\CurrentControl\Services by the SP3 update which had not been there before.</p>
<p>That did not happen to me. I did nothing special prior to or while running update. Everything went fine. No reboots! I did not have an Intelppm entry in HKLM\System\CurrentControl\Services either before or after running Windows Update on my SP2 boxes with all critical updates current. I did have intelppm.sys files in the C:\Windows\System32 directory both before and after the update, although the date on the current version of the file is 4/13/2008.</p>
<p>Is there any chance that Microsoft has installed a fix in the SP3 update package?</p>

		                <p>The HP KB is primarily compounding the issue. Here&#39;s why. You rename the file. But you end up removing SP3. Later on, you install SP3. It&#39;s back with the same problem. Same if you need to repair your system. Only real fix is to disable the IntelPPM file by software. Not by renaming.</p>

		                <p>I&#39;ve tried everything mentioned above and can&#39;t resolve my reboot issues. I have an AMD Athlon X2 and a FOXCONN C51XEM2AA-8EKRS2H motherboard. I installed the system from scratch, no intelppm, only Microsoft signed drivers, etc. I tried the no USB mouse, USB drive, disabling everything I could in BIOS, etc.</p>
<p>What I get is a reboot near the time safe mode displays what appears to be the mup.sys driver. It happens so fast I&#39;m not sure that is really the spot. And yes, I tried the F8 - disable auto reboot but that didn&#39;t work either.</p>
<p>To get anywhere, I had to remove my sata DVD, install a pata DVD and then I could get into the recovery console. From there, I used the &quot;batch spuninst.txt&quot; to remove SP3 and rebooted.</p>
<p>But several things were still broken (Network Connections and IPCONFIG to name a few). At this point, while booted normally, I went into Add/Remove Programs and removed SP3 from there too. You can&#39;t remove SP3 enough times apparently. After the reboot, everything appeared to be functioning now.</p>
<p>Except that Microsoft Update wanted to reinfect me with SP3 again. So one last fix... I installed the SPBlocker available from MS. Now I&#39;m immune to the virus code-named SP3, for a year anyway!</p>
<p>I&#39;m really starting to think this just might be a secret Vista sales campaign ;-)</p>

		                <p>I&#39;ve read one of the comments here from &quot;Highlander&quot; and it gave me an idea. I&#39;ve downloaded the &quot;ntldr fixer&quot; from: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.tinyempire.com/notes/files/fixntldr.exe">www.tinyempire.com/.../fixntldr.exe</a></p>
<p>I took a blank floppy and created a boot disk with it. The computer boot from the floppy (I changed it in the BIOS settings) and windows xp has been loaded. after that i coppied the boot.ini,ntldr and the ntdetect.com files into c:\ and then reboot. The windows has loaded normally without the floppy disk. Since the SP3 installation has failed, i did a system restore to a previous date, because my desktop and my personal settings were erased. I&#39;m not 100% satisfied becuase the system restore did not bring back my wallpaper, my favorites and some files and folders that were on my desktop, but it&#39;s certainly better than reinstall windows and all the programs again. *note* - whomever doesn&#39;t have a floppy drive on his computer, can extract the content of the ntldr fixer file using WinRAR into a flash drive / disk on key and boot from it (don&#39;t forget to change the order of the boot sequence in the BIOS) Hope i helped somebody :-)</p>

<p>The fastest way for you to get help would be to call Microsoft's technical support. Your problem does not match exactly what we know how to fix. They can walk you through how to find the error message and figure out how to deal with it. </p>

<p>Thanks: Those directions&nbsp;may not work, and you should never modify arbitrary numbered control sets. Always modify CurrentControlSet if you can. If you have to boot into a recovery console, first figure out which one is the current control set, and then modify only that one. </p><div style="clear:both;"></div>

		                <p>Very simple fix for HP Pavilion with AMD Athlon 64 processor and Windows Home edition:</p>
<p>1- Restart the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>2- Start &gt;run &gt;type &quot;regedit&quot; and hit OK.</p>
<p>3- In Registry Editor: MyComputer_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Intelppm\Start(right click on the &quot;Start&quot; file within the Intellppm folder and select &quot;Modify&quot;.</p>
<p>4- Change the value data from 1 to 4 and hit &quot;OK&quot;, then reboot the system.</p>

<p>Ben:</p>
<p>There is some kind of bad driver on your computer. Would it be possible to boot without the peripherals, into safe mode, and then run an anti-malware scan from there? </p>
<p>Which driver is it that is causing the problem, or is it not telling you? </p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>its not telling me what driver is the problem but I am unable to boot into any form of windows as I dont have a ps/2 port on this computer. &nbsp;I have tried booting with usb thumbdrive/usb hard drive/usb keyboard/usb mouse and it ALWAYS crash&#39;s with whatever usb device I add. &nbsp;So I think I am running out of options short of throwing the hard drives (its a raid0 setup) into my other system with a ps/2 adapter (my other system has ps/2 ports as I built that system myself rather than the one I am having problems with which is a dell) and hope it boots up. &nbsp;Then hopefully I can update my usb drivers BACK to sp2. &nbsp;Never had any problems with any usb devices until I upgraded (or in this case downgraded) to sp3.</p>

<p>There's been some buzz in the forums about USB problems that severe. I'd really suggest you try to get some interactive troubleshooting from MS on this one. They at least have the ability to walk you through the steps. Sorry, I feel like I am punting on you, but I really can't do a lot via the blog. </p>

		                <p>I had heard of problems, but I didn&#39;t see your blog until 5/15. &nbsp;I&#39;d been putting off installing SP3, but up until I saw your blog I hadn&#39;t realized that there was an HP/AMD specificity involved. &nbsp;I have an Athlon dual-processor HP desktop dating from October, 2006. &nbsp;Anyway, I downloaded and used your &nbsp;&quot;small tool&quot; to disable the IntelPPM driver, and the installation of SP3 went smoothly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to agree with some comments I&#39;ve seen that XP seems to be quicker to respond and load programs after SP3 was applied. &nbsp;Thanks VERY MUCH for creating the tool and offering the documentation on this problem. &nbsp;For once I was able to avoid a problem rather than participate in it.</p>

<p>Do you have any more info on the ASUS A8NSLI Delux Motherboard? &nbsp;I have that board, running AMB 4800+ dual-core chip. &nbsp;My system froze when installing SP3. After 30 minutes I shut the machine off. &nbsp;It then uninstalled SP3, or it thought it had. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SP3 is still shown on my installed programs list, but my Windows Installer is now broken. &nbsp;I can&#39;t install any futher windows updates - they simply fail.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

		                <p>I have an amd system with an MSI K9N-SLI and a 5600+ cpu.I have 4 hhds and one DVD-ROM all with serial ata2 interface,dvd-rw(atapi),audigy4(pci),tv tuner(pci).</p>
<p>I did a fresh install of winXP sp2 pro and immediately applied sp3.After installing all the drivers i noticed that the tv tuner did not install properly(only one of 3 devices showed in device manager yellow marked) and another yellow marker for the firewire controller.i checked both for any details and there was a warning that the motherboard does not have enough information for these devices to operate them properly and suggest a firmware/bios update.</p>
<p>The second thing i noticed was that when shuting down option is selected the pc does not power off automatically but it displays the classic message of win95: you can now safely shut down the pc &nbsp;and i have to press the power button of the case to turn it off!(that would explain the MCPI incompatibility).</p>
<p>The pc boots up fine with no messages whatsoever and works fine too(except the tv tuner).</p>
<p>I found a new bios for the motherboard v.3,10(mine is 3,9) but can not flash it with winflash as it generates an error upon checking the curent bios version.</p>
<p>What can i do in order to bypass the error and flash the new bios.I believe that would solve the problem... </p>

<p>I have the A8N 32-SLI DELUXE board, and fallen foul of the reboot thing; I restored from an image and am back in the land of living. Do the workarounds specified allow you only to recover from the BSOD and then uninstal SP3, or will they allow normal SP3 operation once you&#39;ve recovered?</p>
<p>You rock by the way!</p>

<p>Fortunately I could get into Safe Mode but RUN and &quot;sc config intelppm start=discabled&quot; did not work. &nbsp;Some screen popped up to quickly that might have said why but it might have been the security protection against changes.</p>
<p>I had to use REGEDIT and change the value in START from a 1 to a 4. This was in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENT CONTROL SET\SERVICES\INTELPPM.</p>

<p>What error message is the Windows Installer giving you? You can try deleting the Windows Installer downloads and see if that helps. There are directions here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.onlinecomputertips.com/troubleshooting/update_errors.html">www.onlinecomputertips.com/.../update_errors.html</a></p>
<p>Daniel: </p>
<p>I would try the same thing. It's kind of the first trouble-shooting step for Windows installer errors. </p>
<p>Zoe:</p>
<p>Yes, I would remove the service pack and then see if you can get an update from ASUS that makes it work on your motherboard. I'm pretty sure it is a USB driver problem, but obviously it would probably be easier for you to live without SP3 than without USB.</p>
<p>Mandrakoylos:</p>
<p>You need to boot from neutral media. Do you have an old DOS boot disk anywhere? That would do it. From there you can install the BIOS update.</p>
<p>Kevlarge:</p>
<p>I would say the jury is still out on whether the work-arounds permit normal operation after you use them, specifically the ASUS motherboard one. Many people are reporting serious USB driver problems, even with the work-around attached, so your success rate may vary. Personally, I would use the work-around with SP3 and see how it works. If you decide it worked better before, remove SP3 then. </p>
<p>Ken Brown:</p>
<p>Glad to hear it now works. You cna probably disable the HP Administrator options popup using msconfig if you so desire. </p>

<p> &nbsp;I ahve several Dell Precision 390&#39;s here at work. I completed the XP SP3 updates, all without any problems.</p>
<p>Before I did the updates, I defragged the drives, then ran chkdsk c: /r and rebooted each pc. &nbsp;Which SP3 update are you using? &nbsp;The 66 MB download or the 314 MB download from MS Update site? I used the monster, and burned it to a cd.</p>

		                <p>I encountered reboot hell after installing XP SP3 on my ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard based computer. &nbsp;The only way to boot initially was to plug in a USB storage device. &nbsp;I installed the latest BIOS (1405) without benefit. I fiddled with various BIOS settings and found that disabling the COM port alowed the computer to boot without having a USB device plugged in.</p>
<p>I suspect that the earlier comment about the problem being interrupt assignment and handling is most likely the culprit for this bug.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jesper for his help. &nbsp;This blog is the most useful source on this problem I have found on the web.</p>

		                <p>My custom-built AMD system got nuked by SP3. Probably because my mainboard is an A8N32-SLI DeLuxe. That happened before the various fixes got posted in the MS Tech forum thread.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know what the error was befcause I had fixed my system by the time I learned how to pause a reboot to see the log.</p>
<p> I managed to recover all my partitions except one. I had imaged my OS with Perfect Image before the upgrade, as usual but that did not help as the reboot occurred before Perfect Image could do its thing and my partition tables got screwed anyway.</p>
<p>Here are my specs.</p>

		                <p>BTW, Safe Mode never worked but I managed to get Windows to boot once (just once) using Last Known Configuration. Instead of using Add/Remove programs to uninstall SP3, &nbsp;that is when I decided to just use Perfect Image to restore my system (as it normally does so easily). </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, that did not work and Last Known Configuration stopped working after this so I had lost my opportunity. Again, not sure it would have worked with all my partitions having been messed up.</p>
<p>The way I recovered them was by using BootItNG (which could still see them) and deleting and immediately undeleting them. BootItNG worked that time but shows no GUI since so I now have bought Partition Commander in case O need to do Partition work from outside Windows again.</p>

		                <p>Looks like my first post did not get through.. My custom-built AMD system got nuked by SP3. Probably because my mainboard is an A8N32-SLI DeLuxe. That happened before the various fixes got posted in the MS Technet forum thread. I should have waited a couple of days but I thought my imaging software protected me.</p>
<p>I managed to recover all my partitions except one. I had imaged my OS with Perfect Image before the upgrade, as usual, but that did not help as the reboot occurred before Perfect Image could do its thing and my partition tables got screwed anyway. </p>
<p>Here are my system specs. Using Catalyst 8.3. Absolutely no problems with SP2.</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper</p>
<p>Yes I did submit all memory dumps to Microsoft. ( I have a kernel memory dump activated) Tonight on &nbsp;logging on I received a 0x8E BSOD. I then uninstalled Trend Micro Internet Security 2008. &nbsp;In its place I installed MS Live One Care 2.0. I am now using XP SP2. &nbsp;Acronis developers are analysing my dump files which show 0x2C errors to be the cause of some BSODs experienced early this week. &nbsp;All is well as I wite this. &nbsp;Here is hoping! &nbsp;Greetings from Australia!</p>

<p>Thank you for your script! &nbsp;I have a HP Pavillion Desktop With Windows Media Center 2005, with AMD processor. &nbsp;I had installed Windows XP SP 3 without paying close attention to the installation process (I have never have problems with SP installation -- ever!), which worked smoothly for me. </p>
<p>But just as you had described, as soon as the machine reboots, it goes into infinite reboots. &nbsp;I was able to starts windows in safe mode with networking mode, go to this site (yours) and run your script to disable &nbsp;intelppm.sys. </p>
<p>Indeed that was the root cause for me, as right after that I reboot and everything worked fine for me.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Good question. Lots of people are asking themselves that at the moment. The main advantage of SP3 seems to be performance improvements, as well as some compatibility updates for Server 2008, which you may not really need? </p>
<p>You will have at least a year to get to SP3. Microsoft will not just stop producing security patches for SP2 for at least that long if it follows the standard it has set in the past. Ordinarily, I would say that most consumers should just go ahead and install the new service pack pretty quickly, but in this case, I have a hunch there will be some interesting developments in the next month or so. Unless you feel like you have a compelling need or feel brave, I would consider holding off for a month to see if we can learn more.</p>
<p>One really important thing before installing any service pack is to make sure the computer is clean of malware. I actually think at least some of the problems we are seeing are due to malware that is doing its level best at trying to prevent the OS from removing it. If malware hooks functions in OS binaries, and those binaries later get removed or replaced, you may very well see a lot of the crashes we are seeing. </p>

<p>After installing SP3 it loops rebooting as long as the attached usb hdd is switched off.</p>
<p>As soon as it is switched on the next reboot (and all after that) are fine. Switching it off again booting loops as before. The system can only be booted with the external usb hdd powered on. Uninstalling the SP3 and going back to SP2 all is fine again.</p>

		                <p>Jesper, I posted a while ago after using your tool to fix my problem. I am having another problem on a computer at work that I believe must be related to SP3. After downloading SP3 a Dell Optiplex GX270 with an intel processor began having errors upon restarting. &quot;This application or DLL C:\windows\system32\MSACM32.dll is not a valid windows image. Please check this against your installation diskette&quot;. It comes up multiple times with the same wording and the same file in the body of the error, but at the top in blue it has lsasse.exe bad image, userinit.exe bad image, cftmon.exe bad image, cmd.exe bad image, and on and on. I am able to ok past the error and everything works fine, but everything you do including task manager, control panel etc. is preceeded by one of these errors. I scanned for viruses and malware with norton, spybot, adaware, windows defender and an online scanner, which all came up with nothing. Then I booted into safe mode and did a system restore to a point before SP3 and Voila &nbsp;all the errors stopped.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll wait to try to install SP3 on any more computers, until you have a chance to think on it. Thanks for your help.</p>

		                <p>Have an Asus A8N32SLI-deluxe w/FX-60 CPU. Have been in reboot hell since installing SP3 on Thurs. Figured I would share some knowledge from M$ tech support and Asus tech support. It seems that SP3 resets IRQ&#39;s on this specific family of boards, also defaults to M$ drivers for almost everything. 3 nights now w/ tech from both companies. Seems that surest bet right now is to stay away from SP3. If you really want it, the &quot;best&quot; route seems to be to</p>
<p>A. re-format</p>
<p>B. install XP</p>
<p>C. install new latest BIOS</p>
<p>D. install MOBO drivers(original, you&#39;ll see why in a moment) </p>
<p>E. then FULLY update XP to SP3.</p>
<p>*Keep in mind that you should be running bare minimum hardware at the moment. NO USB ANY KIND. 1 HD, no video drivers, no RAID*</p>
<p>F. NOW you can install latest drivers for MOBO, Video, USB mouse, USB keyboard, RAID</p>
<p>G. Finish configuring PC</p>
<p>By the way, this is an issue between THIS MOBO family and SP3, NO programs are to blame.</p>

		                <p>Jesper, I did without problems the migrations to SP3 on mij HP AMD Desktop Pavillion (T770.nl) PC. </p>
<p>First I investigated with the reg query instruction if intelppm was loaded in the regstry: IT WAS INDEED; the start value was 3. With your tool I changed it to 4 so it was disabled. After that I started the SP3 procedure; no problem at all was there. </p>

<p>Did some detective work, went to Administrative Tools, Services, highlighted Themes. Hit Stop message. Machine reverted to Classic Theme itself. On reboot went back to XP Theme. </p>
<p>Same route again but this time disabled Themes. Reverts to Classic and reboots after that no change.</p>

		                <p>Hey Jesper, thanks for this post.</p>
<p>I had this problem on an AMD based pc - and removing the usb mouse and plugging it into the ps2 port solved the problem.</p>
<p>After I got into windows, I rebooted again with the mouse back in the USB port - but disabled legacy support in the BIOS. After this I got into windows - with the USB mouse.</p>
<p>After this &#39;success&#39; I got curious. And rebooted with legacy support in the bios. Guess what? I still got into windows!</p>
<p>To summarize this: It appears that after installing Service Pack 3 - AMD based computers cannot get into windows with USB devices attached. Once they booted without USB devices - and the SP3 installation is finalized - they can reboot again with USB devices.</p>
<p>If anyone can technically explain this to me - please do so. I&#39;m riddled... but still happy everything is working now :)</p>

		                <p>I have the exact setup a few who have commented here have - Asus A8N32 SLI Deluxe, Nvidia video, Logitech G15 keyboard and Logitech G5 mouse, 3 internal hard drives on SATA connections. I pre-emptively turned off automatic updates 2 weeks ago, thinking that I&#39;d let everyone else be the pioneers on this one. Glad I did. But it is a funny feeling sitting here not getting my updates. Lets hope the firewall/NAT/anti-virus keep me from getting stung by exploits while I wait for ASUS/MS to sort this one out. Will it be a SP3 fix, or will it be a BIOS update, do you think?</p>

		                <p>THANK YOU, Thank you ever so much for your information regarding the rebooting problem. &nbsp;It turned out to be my USB mouse that was preventing WinXP from booting up - it&#39;s fine once I plug it back in when it&#39;s loaded but I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve got to unplug my mouse every time I have to reboot my PC.</p>
<p>I&#39;m utterly relieved as I&#39;ve not lost my data as my backup hard disc went kaput &amp; hadn&#39;t realised before installing SP3.</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper</p>
<p>Sorry to not get back sooner. &nbsp;I removed my HDD stuck it in a Caddy and using my partner&#39;s laptop found and renamed intelppm.sys</p>
<p>A &#39;chkdsk&#39; was run and a traunch of unreadable &#39;File record segments&#39; were flagged up. &nbsp;I closed it down and restarted and this time I got as far as windows loading but the IE7 was reported as not able to load.</p>
<p>PC hasnow carried out another chkdsk an removed a number of file entries. No wIt is back to square one with no possiblility of booting in safe mode or going back to a previous OK point.</p>
<p>Tiem for the sledge hammer maybe?</p>
<p>I cannot find my copy of XP but do have my partner&#39;s copy and the number for my own copy - help?</p>

		                <p>Bayden: you can use any copy of XP to reinstall. It is the product key that must be unique, not the CD. At this point, it seems a reinstall may be the way to go, and ou seem to have reached that conclusion already. </p>

<p>Ben:</p>
<p>There&#39;s been some buzz in the forums about USB problems that severe. I&#39;d really suggest you try to get some interactive troubleshooting from MS on this one. They at least have the ability to walk you through the steps. Sorry, I feel like I am punting on you, but I really can&#39;t do a lot via the blog. </p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Well I tried both MS and Dell neither could fix this problem on my computer (I am the one where any usb device I plug in the computer crash&#39;s). &nbsp;I am waiting for dell to send me a winxp mce 2005 specific dvd for my computer that will allow me to get into repair and replace the usb device drivers with the sp2 drivers. &nbsp;I am hoping once I can get into a repair mode to try what is mentioned on</p>

		                <p>Thanks for the heads up Jesper. &nbsp;I&#39;m now typing from my SP3 updated computer (with Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe MB). &nbsp;Here&#39;s my experience:</p>
<p>1) Backed up everything including bios. &nbsp;I used the Asus Update tool to backup the bios. &nbsp;The tool came with my MB support materials.</p>
<p>2) Upgraded chipset drivers. &nbsp;AMD&#39;s site indicated that I should upgrade the &quot;chipset drivers&quot; prior to applying BIOS upgrades. &nbsp;Well, there&#39;s very little documentation on this other than a downloadable executable that extracts to a floppy. &nbsp;AMD adopts nVidia&#39;s practice of giving a version to a collection of drivers, referring to 6.65 on AMD&#39;s site. &nbsp;You won&#39;t find any single driver with that version - it&#39;s the version of the package. &nbsp;Following some news group suggestions, I went straight to nVidia and found the 6.86 (?) package and downloaded and installed that. &nbsp;This required one reboot and a subsequent reinstallation of network drivers (XP caught this automatically - I just had to point the install program at the drivers in the nVidia downloaded package).</p>
<p>3) Flashed the BIOS. &nbsp;I downloaded version 1805 for my board using a browser and then ran the Asus Update utility to flash the BIOS. &nbsp;I tried using the Update utility&#39;s own &quot;from internet&quot; option, but it always fails (a known problem). &nbsp;I chose the &quot;flash from file&quot; option and pointed at the downloaded BIOS file. &nbsp;The utility was a bit easier than digging out an old floppy to boot into DOS.</p>
<p>4) Reboot into BIOS and turn off Legacy Support for USB drivers.</p>
<p>5) Boot into windows, download and install SP3.</p>
<p>6) Cross fingers, do a dance, wiggle my nose and reboot.</p>
<p>7) Voila! &nbsp;The computer reboots. &nbsp;All seems fine until I go to log into my limited user account. &nbsp;Missing profile? &nbsp;Can&#39;t load settings? &nbsp;My limited acount could find none of its wall papers or custom settings. &nbsp;Apparently others have had this problem. &nbsp;I booted into Safe Mode and reset the password on the account by running &quot;control userpasswords2&quot; with the RUN command.</p>
<p>8) Reboot and try limited user account. &nbsp;Success! &nbsp;My settings are back.</p>
<p>9) Wait and see if there are any long term effects.</p>
<p>Comments: During the installation process, I did NOT remove any of my USB devices (mouse, flatbed scanner, keyboard, webcam). &nbsp;I neither removed or added any USB devices during the process. &nbsp;Basically, I only changed the legacy support setting in BIOS.</p>
<p>I know that makes it more difficult to isolate the problem. &nbsp;Clearly others are finding that removing/adding USB hardware helps. &nbsp;I wonder if it is some sort of IRQ assignment problem as has been suggested by others.</p>

		                <p>My home-built machine uses an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe &nbsp;MB with AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800 CPU, 2GB Corsair RAM, two internal Western Digital 320GB hard drives, and normally has a Maxtor One-TouchIII external hard drive connected via USB. &nbsp;After installing SP-3, my machine went into the continuous reboot cycle, but I was able to get it to boot by DISCONNECTING all hard drives except the C drive. &nbsp;Initially, the machine was configured to automatically restart after system failure, so I couldn&#39;t read the blue screen message as it constantly restarted. &nbsp;After I deactivated the automatic restart setting, I saw that the blue screen message was telling me my BIOS was not fully ACPI compliant, etc. (as you described). &nbsp;Right now, with all hard drives (except c) disconnected (and nothing plugged into USB), the computer works fine (I am using it to write this). &nbsp;But (I have experimented and proven that) if I connect any one of the other hard drives (internal or USB), it stops with the blue screen BIOS problem message. &nbsp;Before I found information indicating that the problem is caused by SP-3, I updated the BIOS (from ASUS website). &nbsp;That made no difference, so I rolled it back, &nbsp;Still made no difference. &nbsp;It is strange that my machine works by DISCONNECTING USB (and other) drives and yours works by CONNECTING a USB device. &nbsp;Thanks so much for the service you provide.</p>

<p>The error message you are getting indicates that there is something wrong with the disk drivers, or possibly with the disk itself. When you say you tried to reinstall, did you try to install over the top of an existing installation? If the drive has been corrupted that will not work, and could lead to the error you are seeing. Assuming you have a backup of your data, delete the partitions on the affected drive and start over. </p>

<p>What particular software programs do you mean? Sorry, but I do not quite understand what you are asking. Generally, software that has the &quot;Designed for Windows &lt;version&gt;&quot; logo on it is certified as designed to standards that work with Windows. There are many more software packages that work with Windows, and a few that sport the logo that have problems, but it is about the only bar there is. </p>

<p>Good advice. :-)</p>
<p>There is no OS like Linux, but, to be perfectly honest, there is no OS like Windows either. They both fill a very important market, and both have their pros and cons. We really do need both, but I appreciate your advice.</p>

<p>Is the computer crashing on that first reboot, or is it simply booting from the CD again? From your description, it sounds like the computer is set to boot from the CD still when it comes up on the first reboot during installation. The installer is supposed to change that, but apparently fails to do so in your case. If that is the case, you should have an option to set the startup device during boot. Usually you do that by hitting one of the F-keys during boot, typically either F2 or F12. See if you can do that and boot from the hard drive. </p>

		                <p>OK- I have an AMD8nx-x running Win XP with SP3.</p>
<p>My video card (an ATI card) died and I replaced it with an NVidia GEForce 7600. &nbsp;Now my computer reboots regularly, at random- but there is no error code or even an entry in the event log. &nbsp;Sometimes it doesn&#39;t want to restart and other times it restartsd normally. &nbsp;Once in a while I get the message about shutting down abnormally and the safe mode menu comes up.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve run numerous virus scans from different companies (all clean), chkdsk, spyware detectors, and even flashed the BIOS- to no avail.</p>
<p>Can this be part of the same bug? &nbsp;Although....it started when I replaced the video card- and at that time I had SP2 installed. &nbsp;I installed SP3 hoping it may help solve the problem.</p>

<p>I have a custom built xp pro machine running amd64 single core cpu and installed all of the sp3 release candidates and final release with no problem. I just upgraded to a amd64 x2, no problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand I have seen a aged compaq do the reboot thing. Didn&#39;t try a fix didn&#39;t have time. I was able to go into safe mode and uninstall sp3, it booted like a champ and ran sp2 no problem. maybe it is oem images</p>

		                <p>I recently fell victim to the Windows XP SP3 farce. &nbsp;I have a desk top and laptop which updated just fine. (Intel machines obviously now.) However, my other HP desktop took the big dive (AMD machine). &nbsp;At first I thought I had a hard drive failure. Later I thought maybe I had a memory failure. &nbsp;For about 2 days I pulled my hair out.</p>
<p>Then I found your blog with the answer to my situation. &nbsp;Bless you and your &quot;small tool&quot;. &nbsp;You made me a &quot;happy camper.&quot;</p>

		                <p>My system consist of an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard, EVGA 8800GTS, 2 harddrive and DVD burner all SATA connected at the time of the SP3 update. &nbsp;After the update my computer would do a constant reboot woth a quick blue screen of death. &nbsp;I was able to do a F8 safe boot and manage to back track before the update of SP3. &nbsp;But it still would not boot with the second hard drive connected. &nbsp;I have to remove the secondary hard drive to boot up so I can save my outlook and other files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I just ran your software to detect the intel drive and it say it does not exist in my &nbsp;system. &nbsp;And it indicated that I&#39;m ready for the SP3. &nbsp;But I&#39;m afraid to go through that trouble again.</p>
<p>I have check online for a bios update on ASUS website, and there is none available.</p>
<p>So can you advice what I can do, because soon or later to upgrade to SP3. </p>
<p>Youcan reply to me at tnguyensac@att.net</p>

<p>Neither safeboot or the disable automatic restart will work. ran a chkdsk from recovery console and the win2003server installation I have on one of the PATA drives, but no errors (XP and Win2003 boot.ini are on the same SATA drive) Win2003 still boots !</p>
<p>Recovery console won&#39;t read the reg. hyves, since REG.EXE is not a supported command. </p>
<p>WinPE reads only his own hyvers; tried BARTS-PE bootdisk with a special regedit for WinPE I fetched from sourceforge, still no luck: hyves can not be read.</p>

<p>Markus: Linux overtaking Windows in 5 years? Like North Korea will open it&#39;s borders to everyone and dismantle it&#39;s weapons. Ya. right.</p>
<p>Mario: Microsoft will not update the service pack. It will either add a prerequisite that is required to download or temporarily block your PC from getting the SP [unless you manually download it]. TRy Jesper&#39;s fix or whatever HP provides.</p>

<p>You have the problem described in the &quot;Second problem, affecting certain AMD motherboards&quot; section above. Try the work-arounds in that section if you want to try SP3 again. </p>
<p>Leo:</p>
<p>You can read the registry hives on the XP volume from Server 2003 if that still boots. I would do a full malware scan to start out with. I am not that familiar with ASUS motherboards, but the one you have does not sound like the one with a problem. </p>

		                <p>I too have an ASUS A8N32-SLI motherboard and I was experiencing the same exact problems others are having. &nbsp;I tried every trick in the book:</p>
<p>1. Tried the USB trick (no luck) :-(</p>
<p>2. Tried the removal CMOS battery (no luck) :-(</p>
<p>3. Removed all USB devices (no luck) :-(</p>
<p>4. Removed 2nd hard drive (no luck) :-(</p>
<p>So I ended up doing the folowing:</p>
<p>1. I booted to the recovery console and ran the commands outlined in &quot;Part 1&quot; only from the following URL: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q307545&amp;ID=KB;EN-US;Q307545">support.microsoft.com/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>2. And VOILA the computer finally booted! &nbsp;And only 2 days of trying all different variations, tricks, cmos settings, and cmos updates. &nbsp; </p>
<p>All I can say is &nbsp;@#!@#!%@# to Microsoft for putting me through this hell!!!!!!</p>

		                <p>Have Asus M2N32-SLI Delux With nvidia 590 Chipset and AMD AM2 5600+ CPU. Major Boot problems with XP SP3. Would not POST or Reboot unless shut down and power disconected from pc for a while. Thought it was a Bios Problem possibly caused by Failed BIOS Chip and or Motherboard componant. Uninstalled SP3</p>
<p>Now absolutely fine, but not before spending &#163;105 on new motherboard and many hours of wasted time &nbsp;THANKS A LOT Microsoft!</p>

		                <p>My HP Pavilion dv9521tx core duo had Vista Ultimate 64 pre-installed. &nbsp;SP1 took 10 hours to install and experienced multiole re-boot failures and horrific complications which have still not been finally sorted out.</p>
<p>I believe there is something fundamentally awry with HP&#39;s image and/or Microsoft&#39;s OS in their 64 bit implementations on machines with AMD processors. &nbsp;My Event Log is replete with errors that suggest to my mind that neither HP nor Microsoft understand how multiple processor machines work and the inter-processor synchronisation issues have not been thought through properly. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know if the intelppm issue exists with my multi media laptop but I do know that I have wasted more than $200K of my time wit this machine and a class action may not be far off!</p>

		                <p>Yippee! A solution for SP3 problems with AMD Athalon Chips! &nbsp;(if your computer has an Intel Chip you should be ok without this additional information. &nbsp;Also, this is a solution for those with HP computers, not sure it would work with other brands Ð check with your computer manufacturer first!)</p>
<p>My HP computer had this problem.</p>
<p>HP couldnÕt solve it Ð Microsoft couldnÕt solve it Ð</p>
<p>This solved it!</p>
<p>Be aware SP3 is huge &amp; takes forever to do the upgrade Ð so be careful &amp; aware!</p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you create a restore point before installing the SP3 upgrade!!!!</p>
<p>What&#39;s up with Vista SP1 and XP SP3?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been hearing horror stories about Microsoft&#39;s latest service packs. I have computers running both XP and Vista. Should I get Vista SP1? Do I need XP SP3? I don&#39;t even know what these updates are for! Can you help me out?</p>
<p>Windows updates are often shrouded in mystery. You check Windows Update. It tells you updates are available. You click Install and forget about it.</p>
<p>Often, we take the recommended updates without a lot of questions. But service packs are a different animal. These aren&#39;t small security patches. They&#39;re huge, and they often promise big changes to your system.</p>
<p>Vista SP1 delivers well over 500 updates. XP SP3 includes a whopping 1,174 updates. Those numbers look scary, but you&#39;ve already got most of the updates. Service packs include every previous update for the operating system. They do not include many new updates.</p>
<p>This ensures you get caught up on all the important updates. But even with all those updates, you won&#39;t see a big change. These service packs do a lot of work under the hood. But they won&#39;t really affect how you interface with the computer.</p>
<p>Let me go over each service pack in a little more detail. I think it&#39;s important to understand what you&#39;re getting and why. I&#39;ll also go over horror stories you might have heard. </p>
<p>Vista SP1</p>
<p>As I said, SP1 has over 500 updates. I couldn&#39;t possibly cover all of them here. Nor would I want to. You would get bored very quickly. But if you&#39;re curious, a list of updates is available. </p>
<p>The updates fall into three categories Ð hardware support, usability and security. There are updates that don&#39;t fit neatly into those categories. But think of them as smoothing out Vista&#39;s rough edges.</p>
<p>Some users that upgraded to Vista found that some devices didn&#39;t work. SP1 helps with device compatibility. It also lays the groundwork for devices you may not own yet. Vista will better identify and support Blu-ray Disc drives. SP1 also adds support for new Windows Media Center Extenders.</p>
<p>SP1 fixes some issues with Vista&#39;s usability. The annoying User Account Control prompts have been reduced. The Windows Genuine Advantage kill switch is removed. Microsoft won&#39;t cripple non-genuine copies of Vista. Some users found long delays when logging on and resuming from hibernation. These wait times have been reduced.</p>
<p>The service pack also fixes a number of security holes. It includes every security update since the launch of Vista. It also improves some existing security features. For example, the BitLocker hard drive encryption has been strengthened.</p>
<p>Getting SP1 </p>
<p>The release of Vista SP1 hasn&#39;t been blemish free. It accounts for most of the horror stories. But when you look at them, the stories aren&#39;t that horrific. There are ways to fix the most common problems.</p>
<p>Many people simply aren&#39;t offered SP1. This can be pretty confusing. The service pack doesn&#39;t show up in Windows Update. And there isn&#39;t much explanation.</p>
<p>Several things can cause this. But one accounts for a majority of people&#39;s problems. Vista SP1 conflicts with some hardware drivers. If Windows Update detects these drivers, you aren&#39;t offered SP1.</p>
<p>The easy fix is to update those drivers. But which drivers are we talking about? Windows Update doesn&#39;t tell you. That information is buried in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. To find it, scroll down to Resolution. Then find &quot;Method for Cause 5.&quot;</p>
<p>Check for driver updates in Windows Update. These may be marked as Optional. If that doesn&#39;t resolve the problem, see the computer manufacturer&#39;s Web site. It may provide downloads for SP1 compatible drivers.</p>
<p>Another problem has been performance issues after installing SP1. These too can be attributed to outdated hardware drivers. But they can also be caused by softwareÑoften security software. Be sure you have the latest versions of your firewall, antivirus and anti-spyware programs.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t be scared away from SP1. The above problems are manageable. And for many people, the update goes off without a hitch. You may have no problems at all. We&#39;re all running SP1 here in the office. And no one had problems with the update.</p>
<p>XP SP3</p>
<p>Again, I can&#39;t cover the more than 1,000 updates in SP3. Here&#39;s a link to the very long list of updates. I can&#39;t think of a more mind-numbing read. But it&#39;s there if you&#39;d like.</p>
<p>Even with so many updates, there&#39;s not much to discuss. SP3 mostly serves to bring your Windows XP up to date. It will give you any updates you&#39;ve missed in the past. It creates a new baseline for all XP users. </p>
<p>SP3 patches new security holes. And it fixes some Windows programs and processes. But there aren&#39;t many new additions. The ones provided are important, but not very interesting. Several have to do with network security or system encryption software. None of these will affect how you use your computer.</p>
<p>One thing to watch for is Internet Explorer. SP3 updates IE 6 and 7.</p>
<p>If you have IE 7, you cannot uninstall it after applying SP3. You cannot go back to IE 6. Also, SP3 will not work with IE 8 beta. If you have IE 8 beta, uninstall it before installing SP3.</p>
<p>Getting SP3</p>
<p>There have been other problems. Some people have been unable to boot their PCs. Or they get stuck in an endless reboot cycle.</p>
<p>In this case, it wasn&#39;t Microsoft&#39;s fault. This is a Hewlett-Packard issue.</p>
<p>HP sells computers with either Intel or AMD processors. It installs the operating system using a disk image. The disk image was created on an Intel machine. It came with Intel specific drivers and registry settings.</p>
<p>This Intel-based disk image was installed on AMD-powered systems. There apparently were no problems until SP3 came along. After SP3 was installed, the computers tried to load the Intel drivers. Only there is no Intel processor for them to act on. The result: The computer crashes. Or, it reboots continuously. </p>
<p>***** HP has recently issued a fix for the problem. Download HP&#39;s Upgrade Utility before installing SP3. It should prevent booting issues.</p>
<p>For everyone else, it appears the SP3 update goes smoothly. You can install it through Windows Update.</p>
<p>Do some preparation</p>
<p>Neither of these updates is small. Many people install them without an issue. But they have the potential to cause problems. Be sure to protect your important files.</p>
<p>Before installing either service pack, back up your computer. If you don&#39;t know which files to back up, read this tip. You may also want to set up a restore point. Should the installation fail, use System Restore to rescue your computer.</p>

		                <p>I was excited to see that there was a possible resolution but was disappointed to see that my machines are Intel but are experiencing the same problems.</p>
<p>Previously, our techs had built images on a VM and then deployed them using a RIS. Nowadays, I build the image on the actual hardware platform and then perform a disk copy. The old images (VM built) perform a cyclic reboot with SP3 but my new image doesnÕt. DoesnÕt pose a HUGE problem on a LAN but on a WAN (me) I would have to travel to x number of countries to reload my new image.</p>
<p>Summary: Intel based-systems (Dell Optiplex) with an image built on a VM (maybe AMD processor?) will crash with the same error.</p>
<p>-B</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>Thank you for putting out a great update. I really appreciate your thorough testing of the new service pack. I am having a lot of fun reimaging the machines on all my networks over my WAN. Actually, my users are having a lot of fun because they went home because their computer is broke. Good luck with all your future updates you push out through Automatic Updates. I look forward to the extra overtime pay for fixing your screw-ups.</p>

<p>BIOS reset worked for me.</p>
<p>More details:</p>
<p>I slipstreamed the SP3 into the installation CD. The installation worked, I got into Windows and installed the AMD Athlon 64 CPU drivers and the nForce4 chipset drivers. But as soon as I installed the NVIDIA display or the AC97 sound drivers the system would be stuck during rebooting at the progress bar which kept on moving (no automatic reboot, no blue screen, etc.).</p>
<p>The trick with USB -&gt; PS2 mouse or the USB thumb drive did not work for me.</p>
<p>I also did not have the intelppm value in the registry.</p>
<p>By restoring the default values of the BIOS (in the BIOS itself, no need for CMOS removal, etc.) I got Windows working again, after wasting 2! days of trying to find out what was going wrong during/after the installation ...</p>

<p>I still do not understand. You likely have the intelppm problem, but what do you mean by error check? Do you have a Windows XP disk you can boot into the recovery console? If not, you need one.</p>
<p>Stefan:</p>
<p>Would you mind posting the offending driver details? It would be useful for others to know which specific nVidia driver to be careful with.</p>
<p>Brandon:</p>
<p>I am virtually certain that Microsoft would tell you that deploying an image built in a VM to physical hardware is as unsupported as deploying one built on Intel to an AMD-based machine. It just shouldn't be done. I wish I could give you better news, but I really think you need a project to update those images. That is just not a safe way to build them. </p>

		                <p>JP: Unfortunately I think you have compounded the problems significantly. A repair installation is essentially a reinstallation, and it appears that it failed. It would very likely not solve your problem anyway, and now it looks like you have a half-finished installation. </p>
<p>I would call Microsoft's technical support and have them walk you through how to handle this. I don't think your problem is simple enough to solve in this forum any longer. </p>

		                <p>Stefan: The issue should not affect an A8N-SLI unless:</p>
<p>a) You have the INTELPPM problem</p>
<p>b) did something non-standard in the BIOS</p>
<p>I have an A8N-SLI [not A8N32-SLI Deluxe which HAS the problem] and it installed perfectly on my second copy of Win XP [fully patched prior to SP3] on my system [my first copy - the &quot;production&quot; install - is more delicate]. </p>
<p>What obviously happened was that you had modified something in the BIOS to give XP hiccups and isn&#39;t directly an issue with SP3.</p>
<p>For me the install was done within 25 minutes including reboot and post-reboot business [I downloaded the big EXE].</p>

		                <p>My computer is an old Pentium 4, 2.53 Gz XP Pro SP2. In the 5 years I have had it never a BSOD or a malware infection. &nbsp;Plenty of hard drive space, up to date with Windows Update etc.</p>
<p>There was no drama in installing SP3. &nbsp;I did it using the 316 MB download. &nbsp;Trend Micro Internet Security 2008 was disabled for the install. &nbsp;All was well for 2 days, then BSODs started usually just after logging on or just after shutting down. Debugging analysis using MS tools revealed that the culprits were Creative Audigy drivers (WHQL), Perfect Disk 8 (latest build), and Acronis True Image Home 11.</p>
<p>On uninstalling SP3 these BSODs continued and a thorough investigation caused me to uninstall Trend Micro, 2008 Creative Audigy, Perfect Disk 8. &nbsp;I have sent the various mini-dumps off the the respective developers. &nbsp;I am not about to remove Acronis as it would be like removing the lifeboats. &nbsp;I will wait to hear from Acronis.</p>
<p>Question to Jesper: Should (can) XP SP3 be installed from safe mode?</p>

		                <p>Glory be,</p>
<p> &nbsp;Going to try and keep this post brief.</p>
<p>For Ati catalyst</p>
<p> &nbsp;There is a new version of ATI catalyst 8.5 drivers available from ATI.amd.com. WHQL signed driver for Sp3. Solves some of the problems people have with Sp3. Gaming, rotation (I hope), HDMI, audio,</p>
<p>For A8n32 mb</p>
<p> &nbsp; In regards to the a8n32 duluxe bios problems I like Lars Kruse, (thanks for reminding me) Send in a new support ticket to asus.com suport. (again) to request some sort of bios update for Sp3. </p>
<p>(Excluding vista. But they seemed to have the sata power issues fixed in later versions of Nvidia drivers.)</p>
<p> &nbsp; Mentioned most of the issues as posted here. Dispatch table problems. Usb key drive required to boot, requested recent amd microcode update, turning off par/serial port to install sp2, ACPI errors when compliant, APM turn off to get sp2 installed. Even when using the latest ACPI bios driver still had a PCI.sys curruption issue, removing Logitech mx 1000 wireless mouse.</p>
<p> Others out there experiencing this may also wish to submit a support ticket.</p>
<p>For Media Center users. </p>
<p> &nbsp;There seems to be some sort of left over debugger attached to the dot net 1.1. Post sp3 install.</p>
<p> &nbsp;Trying to update Media center to Sp3 crashes with input devices or extenders. &nbsp;Using the solution posted</p>
<p>from aumha some on far more patient then I am &lt;italic&gt;Thanks btw for this fix(/e)</p>
<p>step</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;Download and install dot net 1.1 sp1 from microsoft downloads (in your language)</p>
<p>2) Begin a cmd box by ; *clicking on start, *clicking on run. Typing the letters &quot;cmd&quot; press the enter key.</p>
<p>Once you are at the &gt;_</p>
<p>type these letters in exactly. * or you can Copy and paste, ctrl c this command then control v*</p>
<p>%windir%\ehome\medctrro.exe /o /p RunOnce</p>
<p>pres the enter key.</p>
<p>Reboot and test your media center edition. Should be working now.</p>
<p>Hopefully some one find this helpfull out there.</p>

		                <p>First off all thanks for this blog and for your little tool. &nbsp;Unfortunately I didn&#39;t find it before the first time I tried installing SP3 on my HP a1250n AMD-based computer and ended up doing a full recovery. &nbsp;However, on my second attempt at least I got by the reboot problem. &nbsp;However, I still had installation issues. &nbsp;I use D-link wireless and that stopped working I got an &quot;Airpluscfg.exe - entry point not found - the procudeure entry point apsSearchInterface could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll&quot; message. &nbsp;Luckily I was able to go back to a previous recovery point so I&#39;m back at SP2 and everything works again. &nbsp;During the SP3 installation there was also black screen that scrolled a lot of &quot;file not found&quot; or &quot;access denied&quot; messages, but too fast for me to really understand. &nbsp;Anyway I intend to stay at SP2 for now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows update continues to show I have SP3 downloaded and ready to install. &nbsp;Anyone know how I can get rid of it? &nbsp;Don&#39;t want it sitting there just in case a revised version becomes available and it prevents me from getting a new download.</p>
<p>BTW I was able to install SP3 on my HP m7250n intel-based computer and everything seems to be working fine. &nbsp;</p>

		                <p>As there are too many glitches after installing SP3 on my AMD-based computer I&#39;ve decided to stick with SP2 for now. &nbsp;However, while I&#39;ve taken my PC back to an earlier SP2 recovery point, I noticed the Windows Update history shows I&#39;ve got SP3 &quot;successfully&quot; installed. &nbsp;It&#39;s not listed on the Remove Programs menu so I&#39;m not sure how to correct this. &nbsp;Anyone know? &nbsp;I don&#39;t want Windows Updates to think I already have it in case there&#39;s a revised download that addresses all the problems. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

<p>I have HP&#39;s a720n, which is an AMD-based desktop. I have intelppm.sys in C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers. It&#39;s referenced in the registry in CurrentControlSet:</p>
<p>...\Services\Eventlog\System - Sources includes intelppm</p>
<p>...\Services\Eventlog\System\intelppm includes %SystemRoot%\System32\IoLogMsg.dll; %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\intelppm.sys (space added for formatting)</p>
<p>...\Services\intelppm includes:</p>
<p>--- DisplayName: Intel Processor Driver</p>
<p>--- ErrorControl: 1 (hex)</p>
<p>--- Group: Extended Base</p>
<p>--- ImagePath: system32\DRIVERS\intelppm.sys</p>
<p>--- Start: 3 (hex)</p>
<p>--- Tag: 3 (hex)</p>
<p>--- Type: 1 (hex)</p>
<p>There are at least similar entries under the variously numbered ControlSets in the registry as well, for what that&#39;s worth.</p>
<p>I do not have a USB drive attached. Modifications to the system include the last (long ago) BIOS update, a replaced DVD writer and a replaced CD writer, an added hard drive and an added floppy drive. RAM is now 1 GB, double the factory-installed default.</p>
<p>SiSoftware&#39;s Sandra reports on the mainboard:</p>
<p>. Manufacturer : ASUSTek Computer INC.</p>
<p>. Multi-Processor (MP) Support : No</p>
<p>. MPS Version : 1.40</p>
<p>. Model : Kelut</p>
<p>. Version : 2.02</p>
<p>. Serial Number : MB-1234567890</p>
<p>. System BIOS : 06/06/2005-KM400A-8237-6A6LYA0E-00</p>
<p>. Chipset : VIA KT400/A, KT600</p>
<p>I don&#39;t recall exactly when I installed SP3, but the uninstall folder in Windows is dated 5/7/2008, which sounds about right to me. I used the Windows Update download, not the CD iso.</p>
<p>So as far as I know, this HP AMD system has and apparently loads the intelppm driver, but I still have no problems. I&#39;m not complaining, mind you. Just wondering why my experience might be so different -- and hoping these details might point out yet another element in the equation that&#39;s been missed so far.</p>

		                <p>When I rebootet after installing XP service pack 3 on a AMD Duron computer, I received a message that the following file is corrupt or missing:</p>
<p>/windows/system32/config/system</p>
<p>I had this error for several days until I got hold of the XP cdrom. I would then try to boot the machine into the recovery consol, but I was asked for the administrator password which I had forgotten. After submitting a wrong password three times I was told to restart the computer.</p>
<p>This procedure must have done something to the system registry file because windows loaded fine after that!!!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the information! That's very valuable. </p>
<p>WayneGM:</p>
<p>In the comments there is a pointer to removing the SoftwareDistribution directory. That will reset Automatic Updates and remove SP3 from the installation list. </p>
<p>Bert Smith:</p>
<p>No, you should not install service packs from safe mode. I do not believe it is even possible, although I cant' say I have tried it. They are designed to be installed on a normally running computer though.</p>
<p>ESP:</p>
<p>You need to boot to some kind of neutral media. I do not know exactly what the media that HP ships with looks like any longer. Unfortunately, when I received my computer I concluded that the HP custom disks were worthless and threw them away. All I know is that they are not the standard XP disks.</p>
<p>What error are you getting? Is it the 0x7e error? If so, you should be able to boot to safe mode or, if you can locate a real XP disk, not the one HP ships, you can boot to the recovery console. If you have a different error I would suggest you call the Microsoft support line that I give up top. If you can't tell what error you have, and booting to safe mode does not work, you most likely do not have the 0x7e error. In that case, I would hold it as pretty likely that there is some malware, or possibly third-party software, that is causing the problem. If so, your safest bet would be to call Microsoft's tech support and have them walk you through the options. </p>
<p>Timothy J. McGowan:</p>
<p>I can't explain what you are seeing. Everything says you should have the issue. I wonder if maybe you do not have the amdk*n.sys driver loaded for some reason and that is why you are not experiencing the problem? I'm just not sure. </p>

<p>Hmm... You might be onto something. Looks like I&#39;m loading one of two files named amdk(#).sys.</p>
<p>Under CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\MUILanguages\RCV2, there&#39;s a key named amdk6.sys, with a couple of binary entries named 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Under CurrentControlSet\ Enum\ ACPI\ AuthenticAMD_-_x86_Family_6_Model_10\ _0, among other entries, there&#39;s a string named Service with the data AmdK7.</p>
<p>Below ...\_0 there&#39;s a key named Control, alpha string named ActiveService, set to AmdK7.</p>
<p>Under CurrentControlSet\Services\AmdK7, I see:</p>
<p>...DisplayName: AMD K7 Processor Driver</p>
<p>...ErrorControl: 1 (hex)</p>
<p>...Group: Extended Base</p>
<p>...ImagePath: system32\DRIVERS\amdk7.sys</p>
<p>...Start: 1 (hex)</p>
<p>...Tag: 6 (hex)</p>
<p>...Type: 1 (hex)</p>
<p>Under CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\System, AmdK7 is listed in the Sources string.</p>
<p>Under ...Eventlog\System\AmdK7, EventMessageFile is set to %SystemRoot%\System32\IoLogMsg.dll; %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\amdk7.sys</p>
<p>One bit that&#39;s unique: For me, under CurrentControlSet\Control\Class, there&#39;s no reference to intelppm, but there is a {50127DC3...}\0001 key containing a string value named InfSection set to AmdK7_Inst.</p>
<p>Does that suggest that intelppm is &quot;less installed&quot; than the AMD driver, or is its absence under Control\Class not unusual?</p>
<p>Note too that there&#39;s a single reference to amdk6.sys; everything else is AmdK7.</p>
<p>In C:\Windows\System32\Drivers, I see I have amdagp.sys, amdk6.sys, and amdk7.sys. Seems to me they must be loading as well.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s worth anything, but that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing here.</p>

		                <p>I had the above problem to the point that I hit F10 and did a system recovery. I cannot no matter how hard I try get it to go on line to update and reinstall programs that were removed when I hit F10. Can you tell me how to get it back on-line? I have a programming degree (and taught myself some networking), and my husband has a networking degree niether one of us can get it back online.

<p>Timothy McGowan:</p>
<p>I just cannot explain what you are seeing. The only thing I can think of is that the AMD driver and the Intel driver are no set to load in the same control set, or that you are booting in some kind of mode that causes neither to load. I can't tell. </p>

<p>I hear you, but CurrentControlSet is configured to load both drivers, as far as I can tell. I don&#39;t know what to make of it myself.</p>
<p>SiSoftware&#39;s Sandra reports that the Intel Processor Driver&#39;s status is Stopped and its startup type is Demand. It also shows that the AMD K7 Processor Driver&#39;s status is Running and its startup type is System.</p>
<p>But I have no idea how the Intel service gets stopped on this system or how it was set to run on demand. If you want me to look at anything, let me know; else, I guess there&#39;s not much left to say besides &quot;Hmm...&quot;</p>
<p>-- Tim</p>
<p>P.S. I don&#39;t believe I specifically stated this, but I&#39;ve never used any of the workarounds documented here to disable the Intel driver. Just to tie that off.</p>

<p>Yes, start mode 3 is demand start. What I do not understand is how the OS doesn't start that driver then. On Vista 3 is the default start mode for intelppm. For some reason, having start mode 3 on XP means the driver is not loading. I also do not understand why your computer has it set to 3 and not 1, like everyone else's. </p>

		                <p>I have experience with 3 PC&#39;s, including 1 Laptop and &nbsp;1 AMD, installing SP3. They all have Norton Internet Security installed. </p>
<p>Besides the problems mentioned here, people tend to &#39;throw&#39; the service-packs onto their computer running a lot tasks, which also is causing a lot of trouble. Maybe obvious for many techies, but not for most average computer users.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really a pity that companies like Microsoft do not write out the procedure for sensible updating in their SP-descriptions .</p>
<p>The most important thing in the procedure with service packs, not very often mentioned here yet, is BEFORE install :</p>
<p>- Backup or at least make a Windows restore point yourself; Sp3 will do that too, but I am not convinced it does it at the right moment in the install process.</p>
<p>- Check for the problems mentioned here.</p>
<p>- Do a fresh reboot and do nothing else but the below mentioned before you start your update</p>
<p>- Stop as much possible automatic starting tasks, amongst them printer, camera, MSN, Skype etc.. </p>
<p>- Most security software is hard to really stop, but you should at least disable the firewall and antivirus tasks </p>
<p>- Disable your Network Adapter, as you not protected anymore by your security software.</p>
<p>- Start your update and leave the machine alone untill finished and reboot.</p>
<p>Doing the SP3 update this way. i did not have any problems with SP3 and did not have to uninstall any software. </p>
<p>I did check first of course for the problems mentioned here.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#39;s a lot to add to this, but these are the essentials IMHO.</p>
<p>Hope this helps some people preventing SP3 problems.</p>

<p>If you have a PS/2 mouse, or a way to hook a USB mouse into a PS/2 port, use that. I would also encourage you to call Dell technical support and see if they have any solutions. The problem may be solvable by changing some settings in the BIOS, but I do not know which ones to have you try. </p>

<p>The problem was a coincidence and not directly related to the SP3:</p>
<p>By slipstreaming the nForce4 chipset drivers (6.65) the &quot;IDE software drivers&quot; that are included in this driver package were installed too (no possibility of deciding what is integrated). Now, after so many wasted hours of trial and error I found out, that they can cause problems and should only be installed when really needed.</p>

		                <p>I thought I&#39;d post my experience. &nbsp;Its not anything drasticly diferent from what is above. &nbsp;I have a home built computer built on an ASUS A8N32 SLI Deluxe MB. &nbsp;The processor is an AMD 3700+. &nbsp;I have two 250gb SATAII drives in Raid 0. &nbsp;AndI have two eVGA 7900&#39;s in an SLI configuration. &nbsp;Mouse and KB are USB. &nbsp;I have a bunco of other crap plugged into the USB ports including a USB Hub and Multi card readre that is attached to my dell monitor, a scanner, a MS Zune, a Palm Hot Sync Cradle, and a 500GB USB external drive that I use for backup. &nbsp;When I tried to install SP3 I got the endless loop thing. &nbsp;I tried to do the command to disable IntelPPM but I was notified that the fiew didnt exist on my machine. &nbsp;I already had a drive plugged into the USB. &nbsp;My error was the A5 error or maybe an A7. &nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure it was the A5 but something is nagging me about the A7 and I dont know why.</p>
<p>I took advantage of the free help for SP3 as posted above and spent about 3 hours on the phone with MS tech support. &nbsp;We first established that I could not boot into safe mode or safe mode with networking and last known good configuration. &nbsp;I already knew this but I had to make the MS tech happy. &nbsp;The Tech then walked me through uninstalling SP3 from the recovery console. &nbsp;Since I had a RAID 0 configuration I had to press f6 during the boot up of the CD to install the RAID drivers. &nbsp;Once they were installed and the recovery console was loaded I unstalled SP3. &nbsp;Upon exit, my machine booted normally. &nbsp;Checking the OS version (winver) reported that SP3 was installed. &nbsp;the rest of SP 3 was unistalled via the Add/Remove programs. &nbsp;We then started the computer in safe mode and I transfered control via the internet to the tech so she could install SP3 for me. &nbsp;After install and restart the endless loop started again. &nbsp;I did the uninstall from the recovery console and then the uninstall via Add/Remove programs and now i&#39;m back to SP2</p>
<p>I dont know if the USB is the issue, RAID is the issue, SLI or whatever. &nbsp;SP3 crashed my system and the MS tech could not get it to run. &nbsp;She claimed that it was a hardware conflict and advised that I contact the hardware manufacturer. &nbsp;I guess I&quot;m stuck with SP2 until Asus or whoever comes up with a solution.</p>

		                <p>Also have the endless reboot problem with sp3 and the A8N32 SLI Deluxe. Luckily I had a winternals ERD CD at hand. So uninstalling SP3 was a piece of cake. Won&#39;t try reinstalling SP3 any time soon. ASUS or MS has to come with a solution first. I did read however in the ASUS forum that someone with the same boot-problem got the A8n32 sli deluxe running again after disabling the paralel port in the BIOS. Have not tried that myself though.</p>

		                <p>I am very iliterate when it comes to computer tech talk. I know I have an AMD processor and on May 19 I downloaded SP3. The first download failed - I do not know why. Second time - ok. I have not experienced any major problems as described by others in this blog but periodically the computer will reboot automatically. This only happens when no one is using it &amp; there are no blue screens or error messages. It is only somewhat annoying but I would like to stop it from happening as I know that it should not be occuring. Any simple fixes ?</p>

		                <p>I have HP laptop NW8240 ( intel with ATI graphics, HP version of Catalyst software, and Norton Internet Security 2008 ).</p>
<p>SP3 originally installed OK, then over a week, the computer would randomly reboot - even when I wasn&#39;t using it. The reboots gradually increased in frequency, &nbsp;and it was rebooting with BSOD 0x0000000A ( screen happened so fast that it was easier to capture with a digital camera and read ).</p>
<p>The computer then started to claim HDD died, no NTLDR, refused to start, and other obscene messages and behaviour. Did error check on drive, noting that it had to restart to access some windows file areas. </p>
<p>I returned to discover that Laptop fan is off when HDD error checking scan is running ( took over an hour ), &nbsp;so drive and laptop got very hot. Ouch, good one HP, next time I&#39;ll use an external fan. </p>
<p>Went hunting on Internet, found your Blog ( a great help ), and noted that I had HP video drivers that included Catalyst as well as NIS 2008.</p>
<p>HP put new ATI catalyst driver ( 8.39 ) between 5 May and 23 May on support site, so downloaded and installed that ( 115MB !). No improvement.</p>
<p>Other updated ATI drivers ( 8.5? now SP3 compliant ) on WWW specifically say they are not &nbsp;for HP OEM versions of the video cards listed, so I&#39;ll have to wait.</p>
<p>Told &nbsp;SP3 to uninstall, which it falsely told me it has succeeded at, but then SP2 functions such as Defragementation wouldn&#39;t work - claiming the disks had been manipulated with a later version. </p>
<p>Removed the ATI Catalyst drivers, checked MS update, and found that the Catalyst drivers had also prevented a MS .net Framework 2 SP1 update. The update worked once Catalyst was fully removed. </p>
<p>Then again disabled Norton Internet Security 2008 using options menu, installed SP3, and so far ( 2 days ) it&#39;s been fine. The delayed problems seem to have been mainly caused by the Catalyst driver, and possibly by NIS 2008, and accumulated over a period of a week, rather than instant death as others report.</p>
<p>Maybe the failed .net update also contributed to the failure. &nbsp;Have over 20 temp files of error messages sent to MS, but about 50% were reported by MS as being corrupted. </p>
<p>I&#39;m a little annoyed at the sanctimonious MS automated response that tells me that corrupted error files are caused by hardware failure. Since when was a critical SP3 update hardware?. </p>
<p>Hope this might help some other poor soul, and please keep having fun.</p>

		                <p>I have an Intel P4 and Gigabyte MB, I&#39;ve tried many of the suggestions above for Intel systems. Yesterday I removed SP3 using the info above but guess what? The problem still exists, I&#39;m still getting the same stop codes as before: </p>
<p>*** STOP: 0X0000007B(0XF8B8C524,0XC00000034,0X00000000,0X00000000)</p>
<p>Is it time to wave goodbye to all my programs and settings and reinstall and start again or is there something else I could try.</p>
<p>Like everyone else who has problems I&#39;d really appreciate some guidance please if you can spare the time.</p>

		                <p>Had the endless boot loop problem after installing SP3. Tried several things with no luck. Uninstalled SP3 everything booted fine. Found your Blog with 0X0000007E search. Read the instructions on things to try and ran the &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot; and installed SP3 again. Booted no problem. Running HP Pavilion a1630n desktop with dual AMD Processor with Asus A8M2N-LA motherboard.</p>
<p>Thanks Jesper for a easy to follow problem solver article.</p>

<p>The best I can do is point you at MS KB article <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/324103">support.microsoft.com/.../324103</a>. </p>
<p>The first step in the trouble-shooting would be to run a full malware scan if you can boot the computer. You may not be able to. Does it boot at all? How about into Safe Mode? If it boots into Safe Mode it is likely a device driver. Anti-malware software could also cause that type of problem. If you can boot into safe mode, use that to remove the anti-malware software. </p>
<p>You could also have an IRQ conflict. I am not familiar with the motherboard, but the ASUS motherboards seem to have that problem. </p>

		                <p>Evening all</p>
<p>To any Asus Mb users. Navigate to the asus site and please request an update bios for any a8, a8n32, M2 mb that include the microcode updates. APM fixes, ACPI, Key drive, lack of proper support for Sp3.</p>
<p>To any one experiencing an not ACPI compatible. Turn off cool and quiet and APM will allow you to get further installing.</p>
<p>About the advice of turning off anti-virus programs. In the opening acceptance of Sp2. It plains states get a comptible virus protect program with Sp2. People tend to forget and just click accept. And complain about Microsoft not doing enough QA for there Sps. When the Sp is the basis of the operating system, its the other way around. We as users need to ensure the comptaibility of programs we purchase. </p>
<p> &nbsp;Why would anti-virus makers have a clause, &nbsp;their escape cause. &quot;We the manufacture will not be held liable for any loose of date in the use of these program&quot; </p>
<p>To Aussie Ron,</p>
<p> &nbsp;Which mb are you using? There are soo many Intel chipsets. Not having the correct .inf doest allow for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<p> &nbsp;The reason your hard drive is not available you may have an OEM disk With out the intelppm problems or conflict with AMD is the OEM disks do not have any sort of Support for MB made after the image of Xp was produced.</p>
<p> &nbsp;Which Xp are you using home? an oem disk from Mesh? One for Media center?</p>
<p>X64? </p>
<p> &nbsp;Searching for you mb make Asus, Intel, or at least the chipset will provide you with an downloadable driver to extract the infromation you need to install Xp. Cheers and take care.</p>
<p>To Bruce yes the catalyst 8.5 are WHQL signed for Sp3. If you go to the mobility section and see if your laptop is included in the support hardware you should be ok to install them from ati.amd.com</p>
<p>To Rober G</p>
<p> If you are using an A8n32 deluxe update to the latest Bios you feel comfortable with 1302. 1405 if possible. &nbsp; How old is your system? Any bios that is ove 4 years old should be updated. Yes I know some mb manufactors quite. But at least should make your system more stable by using the last one out.</p>
<p>Which version of the via chipset are you using the latest? </p>
<p>The video card? That would be my first suspect in cause a problem with Sp3, do you have a spare card to switch out with to troubleshoot your error?</p>
<p> &nbsp;Have you check the memory stability and ran a memory test and made sure the fans are clean? *just a guess here</p>
<p>Which error are you receiving?</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms794023.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/.../ms794023.aspx</a></p>
<p> &nbsp;Disconnection of network adaptor. Or disabling it. Not a good idea. let sp3 discover any network adaptors. Disconnecting the cable is a better idea.</p>
<p> If you have a card reader Sony, generic. Better to remove these first. And install later. The magic of changing drive letters is not fun when updating an operating system. And can let to crashing.</p>
<p> Later all. </p>

		                <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Servicepack 3 &amp; Asus A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard users having the issue of continues reboots after installing SP3. If you disable the parallel port in your bios (my one is V1405 the latest avail beta version for this board) you will be able to boot again without the need to have an external device like an HDD or an USB stick connected to your system. This workaround works fine for my system today.</p>
<p>I would really like to know why my LPT port is not ACPI compliant, because this was the BSOD error message that comes up as long it is enabled in the bios. Maybe someone can explain that to me .....</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this one will also work for you :-)</p>

<p>Are you sure the error is 0x8E? Usually that means you have bad memory. It is described in this article: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q315335">support.microsoft.com/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>I can't see why the memory problem would only occur under SP3 and not SP2 though. Is there a BIOS update for that mobo?</p>
<p>Dave: </p>
<p>You're the first person I've heard report that error. Sounds like another incompatible mobo. Check with ASUS if they have a BIOS update. </p>

<p>Every time i have tried to install SP 3 it hangs for hours on the last part of the process &quot;running processes after installation&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have plenty of memory and huge hard drive so space is not a problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have disabled my anti-virus and anti-spyware programs but SP3 still does not want to install. &nbsp; To stop the install I have to use the task manager to </p>
<p>kill it. Luckily the system has rolled back to SP2 on restart.</p>
<p>At this point I think my best solution would be to leave the SP3 alone for the time being and hope the problems get sorted by microsoft. &nbsp;Jesper....would you agree this to be my best course of action or do you have any other suggestions?</p>

		                <p>So, the first 2 times I tried to install SP3 - endless reboot, however, was able to get into Safe Mode.. &nbsp;I have a Dell Dimension E521 - but, the copy of XP Pro is my own I bought from Bestbuy. &nbsp;Most everything&#39;s stock except for upgraded RAM and video card (nVidia 8800 GT latest drivers). &nbsp;So, just after reading this and running the .vbs file (which told me I didn&#39;t have the file/registry key anyway) it boots up fine, wtf? &nbsp;The only change(s) were some services I dsabled and closing out SB S&amp;D Tea Timer.. I&#39;m pretty sure I did that on the SECOND time I tried to install SP3. &nbsp;I can gather a list (of what I can remember) of what services I disabled but for whatever reason, SP3 worked beautifully on the 3rd attempt (3rd time&#39;s a charm, right?).. so.. more than likey it was Spybot Search &amp; Destroy that probably corrupted some files or whatnot.. &nbsp;Oh, and I attempted SP3 on 2 other computers as well and the same thing happened and all 3 were completely updated - the common denominator - SB S&amp;D.</p>

		                <p>Hi !</p>
<p>I Didn&#39;t get the constant reboots with SP3 but did get the BIOS non ACPI Compliant message with my AMD processor and Asus SLI Deluxe motherboard.</p>
<p>Managed to boot into windows with a recovery floppy disk with NTDETECT.COM, NTLDR and a boot.ini file on it (luckily prepared after a recent virus left me unable to boot) so I could get into windows to uninstall SP 3. Tried reinstalling SP3 tonight to try the USB drive fix and although this worked, like most it would only boot with the USB drive in the port.</p>
<p>Afraid I was going to knock the stick and snap it off in the port I uninstalled SP3 again and await an official fix from Microsoft..</p>
<p>I guess we&#39;ll be waiting a looong time.. </p>

		                <p>Yes, I encountered the problem and did the whole reformat bit (in the end I only lost two files that I coulodn&#39;t replace from back-up discs) and returned my computer to XP2 until HP finally issued their fix for the faulty image problem. It is only NOW that I have discovered YOUR blog (wish I had found it sooner) but there is a link to it from my homepage in case anyone encounters problems the HP fix doesn&#39;t address. It worked GREAT for me.</p>

		                <p>Two more parts to explain.</p>
<p> The reason Turning APM off, some sort of error in the design of Asus bios and Xps power management do not get along. Disabling this wuill allow for complete installation of Sp2 or 3.</p>
<p>Bios design errors. </p>
<p> &nbsp; And yes I do have the latest ACPI approved driver and the ATK button driver 104.0. what ever installed/downloaded from asus.</p>
<p> This also involves the Key drive and the parrell port. I currently have my printer port off, and my computer still requires having a Key drive present.</p>
<p>A) I have removed my USB IBM floppy drive.</p>
<p>b) I use a SCM access card for work.</p>
<p>c) My computer keyboard is on the PS/2 type connection.</p>
<p>d) Adding the Items up on the USB bus it seems to have a limit 4 items to cause problems with Xp sp2 boot. (The powered hub reccomended by avoiding resume from hibernation issues.</p>
<p> &nbsp;If you look for the history of 95 and Xp there are bios hacks for many different things The OS has to have supported. </p>
<p> &nbsp;IE 4 Cd drives. Xp still has some bios workaround for incomplete or none standard bioses. You can get the names your self with some searching MSDN or Technet. This involving just involving IDE alone.</p>
<p> If Sp3 were to include a generic Sata driver to expand another demension the problems Microsoft Xp will have with patches over patches.</p>
<p> &nbsp;Good driver writing is suppost to be done by the maker of the MB since they know the issues with the chipsets. </p>
<p>*Heat, Powermanagement, timing issues, and the memory chips they accept support by putting on Hardware qualified on there web site.*</p>
<p> &nbsp;Turning off the parrel port and the serial port free up a couple of IRQs hardware uses to get the OS attention. This is a design of the Plug and play hand off done to the OS. Which the bios is suppost to test the existance of items and intialize them.</p>
<p> Which Xp uses virtual irqs along side the exisiting ones to be able to support all the things we attach to the computer.</p>
<p>Perhaps its time to fully move away from our ancient IBM Pc design into a EFI world or at least one with enough room for improvement for a time period of oh say a year, perhaps two?</p>
<p> (Not going to give you the amount of quantums that is suffice to say not all installs are running full tie except servers.)</p>
<p> &nbsp;ACPI is a hack of its own. Not going to complian about it was a direction when one was needed to expaind the Xts basic design. Can you say We are not going to need over 1 meg. Just teasing.</p>
<p>So please search the xp solution center. Use live search and there are at least if not many answers for our problems, and please requesting support by mb manufactors. For supported upgrades and fixes.</p>
<p>Top two items besides what Jesper has written about the the lack of understand of lesser adminstrator and Full computer adminsrator.</p>
<p>Lesser adminstrator lacks special permissions to do the things Sp3 wants to change. Most computer users can see this by at there adminstrator rights under the user panel. And see the special permissions are lacking. The original testing period this was stated more clearly by the install requirements. &quot;Please log into your FULL adminstrator account on your computer first&quot;</p>
<p>*Illustration, May 2008 Mark Russinochs blog posting*</p>
<p> The second thing is to disable the software designed to protect the computer from changes. Which what the Anti-virus Anti malware programs are in direct conflict with.</p>
<p> &nbsp;Any way just trying to share a view point from the end of the power lines. *another story&quot; Cheers</p>
<p>what update directorys can I delete after in installing Sp3?</p>
<p>C:\%windir%\softwaredistribution\download</p>
<p>C:\%there is going to be a unique number here.</p>
<p>In the root directory there is an installation folder that was temp. And can be delete after a few reboots. Once you know your system is working ok. This is the installers location. There might be more then one.</p>
<p> &nbsp;I would look around them first and see if it pertains to Sp3. If it does and your system is stable then go ahead and delete</p>

<p>This is the same system that I reformatted after I installed the SP3 ON THE ORIGINAL INSTALL. I reinstalled with a different OEM XP Home disk. Is this why it&#39;s saying that file doesn&#39;t exist? I wonder will the samething happen if I install SP3 on this new install?</p>

		                <p>HP Pavillion a1210n with media center, AMD processor, 200 GB harddrive; updated to 3 gig SdRAM. &nbsp;Downloaded SP 3 after having Windows do scan. &nbsp;This came up as a critical update, so started downloading. &nbsp;No heads-up on the issues regarding rebooting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After dowload, computer would not boot in Safe Mode; last known best configuration; nothing. &nbsp;Blue Screen Error was 0x00000024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Had a Windows Home Edition CD and could not boot computer to a windows directory. &nbsp;Would have options of H: \I386 and H: \MiniNT. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Contacted Microsoft Support, but first tech could not help me, so case was kicked up to higher level. &nbsp;Next tech got me running again using the&nbsp;following steps: &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Booted again with the Home Edition CD and chose H: \I386 then c: &nbsp;</li>
<li>At the C: tried CD Windows, resulting in path file specified not valid. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Tried C: Dir and got error occured during directory enumeration. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Did C: chkdsk /p which ran and identified one or more errors. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Next ran C: chkdsk /R. &nbsp;This ran about 2 to 2.5 hours before completing. &nbsp;Did not report any error status correction, essentially getting same report as after chkdsk /p. &nbsp;</li>
<li>C: Exit which rebooted the computer to a blue screen, but now I got the more common error of 7E reported. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Rebooted again to Safe Mode, which was slow to happen, but computer then came up and I was able to log onto adminstrator account. </li>
<li>Start&gt;Run&gt;regedit&gt;HKEY_Local_Machine&gt; +System&gt;+Current control Set&gt;double-click Services&gt;Scroll down to Intelppm&gt;open folder to double-click on Start and set the value to 4. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Close out and reboot. &nbsp;</li>
<li>After that, machine booted, but things were slow. &nbsp;</li>
<li>We reset the memory paging to Min = 3000 and Max = 4000 and now, my 14 year old will work it over with his &quot;progects&quot; and if he gives me a thumbs up, I won&#39;t uninstall SP 3. &nbsp;</li></ol>

<p>Disabling intelppm worked like a charm...it was so scary having the Blue Screen of death, followed by Safe mode taking like 15 minutes to load. Eh I am dragging on...thanks for helping me. Oh...do you recomend that we should keep SP3 after fixing up the intelppm bug of head bagging stress?</p>

<p>Yes, if the computer works properly under SP3, keep it. Make sure you have a full backup though. It takes a while to do, but I like using the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard for document backups. You could try that. </p>

		                <p>I had the same problem as someone else who has posted on this blog. I have a Dell computer with an Intel chip. After installing SP3, at least one of my devices stopped working (in my case it was a scanner), and when I opened the Device Manager window, it was completely blank!</p>
<p>I got help from Microsoft. I&#39;m pretty sure that the problem was caused by Symantec software. I had both SystemWorks and Internet Security installed on my computer. I removed all Symantec software first. That didn&#39;t fix it. Then, I edited the registry key, by removing all keys that started with the string, &quot;$%&amp;&quot;. There were about 200 such items, under the LEGACY/LIVEUPDATE subkey, which again, makes me think that this was caused by Symantec programs, and was not the fault of Microsoft.</p>
<p>This was a very time-consuming fix for me, but Microsoft&#39;s employees were very helpful. Maybe someone should tell Symantec about this problem.</p>

		                <p>I have an AMD HP Media Center Edition with NVidia nForce Networking Controller. I experienced complete crash after installing SP3 first time. Computer shut down and came back on with the same problems of booting and rebooting as previously mentioned in many blogs. I did all the tests recommended, tried system restore to no avail and I finally did a system recovery which seemed to &nbsp;work until I my system automatically installed sp3. Once again, it shut down, finally got it back on after leaving it off overnight. Only at that point I had no internet connection due to a problem with sp3 and the NVidia Network Bus Enumerator. Said the ethernet was not connected, the sm bus controller wasn&#39;t connected and the Video Controller (VGA Compatible) was not connected. I ultimately did another recovery from my recovery disks I made when I first purchased the computer. All was good until sp3. When sp3 downloaded and installed, it shut down and caused my system to be unstable. Rebooting was sloooowww. So, I did a system restore using the safe mode. Wouldn&#39;t restore in normal mode. As of right now, I will not put sp3 back on. Also, this last restore restored my computer to XP Professional sp2. Never has been XP Pro. Always been Media Center 2005. Also still shows my NVidia Network is not connected. (As you can see I am on the internet so that is wrong.) But has the little yellow question marks next to all the subs below NVidia nForce Networking Controller. I didn&#39;t do the sp3 at first when it was in trial because I knew there would be some porblems just like sp2 to work out. But, my goodness, this is ridiculous!!! I almost called HP to fix my problems and I may still do that since I do have an in-home service contract with them. What are people who are even less knowledgeable than me, do? I am a novice at this stuff and self-taught. I just do what I can and follow computer prompts. Sometimes I get lucky, but it has cost me 5 days this time. And I still have to do all the updates manually since Microsoft Update thinks I have already installed all the updates that I lost when I recovered my system. Very unhappy with SP3.</p>

<p>Can you boot into the Recovery Console? I think you have a similar problem to what Dave had. Check out &quot;Dave said on 26 May, 2008 09:41 AM&quot; above. I wonder if the AVG suite caused it in your case.</p>
<p>Bruce:</p>
<p>Symantec is well aware of the problem. They are now recommending you disable their software before you install SP3. Gregg Keizer, who has been following this story in Computer World, wrote and article about that just today: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9089658&amp;source=NLT_PM&amp;nlid=8">www.computerworld.com/.../article.do</a></p>

Being non-technical I thought I was being stupid and your blog has cheered me up, there clearly IS a problem. I have asked Microsoft Support for help. Meanwhile I do nothing. I will keep an eye on your blog - thanks.</p>

		                <p>Adding to my comment on May 20th:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve loaded the last (beta)BIOS 1018-002 to my ASUS A8V-de luxe MoBo. tried settings as no LPT port no ACAPI(2) or no PnP-OS inserted USB drives. even a CHKDSK /R from the Win2003 Server installation did not find anything, finally I&#39;ve found a anti-virus program that supports a Windows Server version, wich found a mallware/tracker in a zip-file, but I doubt &nbsp;that would cause since I nevver used the program in the zipfile.</p>
<p>As options where running out I decided to use fixboot and fixmbr however this redered my drive &quot; bootless&quot; </p>
<p>even a bootcfg /rebuild added entries, in the boot.ini but still no boot.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to reinstall a slipstreamed SP3 XP , worked, but could not install office 2003 ; eradicaded errors. so went back to the bare XP.</p>

<p>However, our Packard-Bell computer still doesn&#39;t work&#160;: we can only boot in safe mode. First, we have restored the system like it was one day earlier. We have run several times &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot;, as Administrator, and for each &quot;user&quot;&#160;: last night, finally, I thought the problem was solved, since I could start normally. But this morning... after a couple (or more) of blue screens, or even black screens (computer completely frozen), the problem remains. I&#39;ve even tried to rename the intelppm.sys file (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=c01457284&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN">h10025.www1.hp.com/.../genericDocument</a>)</p>
<p>But everything is useless&#160;!</p>
<p>Our computer doesn&#39;t boot normally, and we desperately need help (please forgive my poor english).</p>

		                <p>Again a successfull install of SP3 (see my earlier post).</p>
<p>This time a clean recovery install (Sp1) from the restore partition on a HP A350.nl system with an AMD processor and a NFORCE2 chipset .</p>
<p>I thoroughly checked the driver and services population first and came to the conclusion that HP systems of around 2003-2004 are a mess!!</p>
<p>- No IntelPPM found, so no problem there</p>
<p>But :</p>
<p>- Intel, SIS and VIA drivers all over the place, although the system has a Geforced 440MX VGA chip builtin.</p>
<p>Disable these in Device Manager before install SP3</p>
<p>- In Software there were SIS and Intel program items too.</p>
<p>Try to uninstall them before SP2/3</p>
<p>After that SP2 and SP3 installed flawlessly and all is working fine. </p>
<p>Remarks : </p>
<p>- For people who need to restore from the recovery partition without being able to boot Windows : look for an option for recovery in the HP-BIOS boot screen (with the HP Invent logo) on startup - mostly F10. Look in your manual; it&#39;s there.</p>
<p>- After install I put a NVidia FX5200 Video card in and standby refused to work with the Windows supplied drivers (Version 56.72). On another system I use V61.21, which is very stable and solved the problem. This maybe is a solution for older NVidia cards with SP3. Download at MSI website is the best and compatible with most cards; NVidia doesn&#39;t offer that version. </p>

		                <p>First i want to say that the installation of Windows XP3 worked perfectly, no problems on a three months old amd machine. But a few days later, and that was really strange, i got this bluescreen message which is shown above, 0x0000007e. I could fix it by choosing the last known good configuration but two days later this message appeared on my screen again. I did not install anything. This bluescreen does not often appear but from time to time and only after rebooting Win XP. The same thing happened on a fresh installed Win XP system. It seems there is something wrong with SP3. Perhaps this error message is caused by my friend NIS 2008. I don&#39;t know at this moment. There are some other problems with SP3 which have not found out so far. This is my opinion. If i started windows only, worked on a few docs for example and turned off my pc, i would not have realized this error message. Crazy stuff. I decided to go back to SP2 and forget about SP3. Thanks for reading.</p>

		                <p>Just something that worked for me...</p>
<p>I got an Asus A6000 laptop with a INTEL centrino 1.73ghz cpu and ati radeon x700.</p>
<p>I couldnt even boot up in safe mode so I simply couldnt uninstall sp3.</p>
<p>I fought this reboot hell for a while and was thinking about giving up and do a clean format since nothing I could find googling helped me. No AMD here. So I thought I&#39;d try one last thing. </p>
<p>I went into BIOS and disabled EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. Every port, usb, you name it. Even the DVD player/burner. All I left &quot;running&quot; was the harddrive.</p>
<p>And wow, all of a sudden I could boot into SAFE MODE and even NORMAL MODE after beeing so rude to the poor BIOS. </p>
<p>Up and running in NORMAL MODE I uninstalled SP3 and then I had to &quot;repair&quot; the damage I&#39;d done to the BIOS.</p>
<p>Now the laptop is working just fine and I&#39;m sure as hell not installing any SP3 packs on it, I&#39;ll stick to security updates thank you very much.</p>
<p>Disabling all the BIOS stuff you can might be the easiest way to uninstall SP3 if you cant even get up and running in safe mode.</p>
<p>Try that good folks if nothing else works for you. Or maybe just try it before anything else.</p>

		                <p>Jesper, you have helped me with a couple of XP SP3</p>
<p>problems. I beg you to give me some direction on this. I have a Dell optiplex GX520 computer with a Intel Pentium 4 (I know, I know, this thread is about AMD problems). I downloaded the sp3 update, and upon rebooting I get a bsod that says &quot;an attempt was made to execute non executable memory&quot; 0x000000FC(0xF88D48E8,0x0292c963,0xF88D4848, 0x00000001. I tried last known good config, can&#39;t boot into safe mode, and it won&#39;t even boot from the dell reinstallation disk. The computer is scanned weekly for malware, viruses etc. At this point I&#39;m suspecting some major hardware issue. What would Jesper do? Just a thought... if I have another identical computer that was upgraded just fine, and I backed up the whole computer on a shared network drive and made an ASR disk, would that be of any use to me or is the ASR disk tied to the computer BIOS? Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

The first download failed - I do not know why. Second time - ok. I have not experienced any major problems as described by others in this blog but periodically the computer will reboot automatically. This only happens when no one is using it &amp; there are no blue screens or error messages. It is only somewhat annoying but I would like to stop it from happening as I know that it should not be occuring. Any simple fixes ?</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help.</p>
<p>Now on May 30th I have a little more to go on - an error code - I only found it when I disabled the system auto restart and I would not have known about that except for this site - the error code is STOP:0x000000F4 (0x00000003, 0x850646E8, 0x8560485c, 0x805c8BFC).</p>
<p>Jesper , can you assist me further - I would really appreciate it - many thanks.</p>

		                <p>Pam, I can help you out with your problem. &nbsp;The problem you are having is with oem usb drivers on the dell pc. &nbsp;All you have to do is unplug all usb devices and you will see the pc with boot up. &nbsp;After that you need to get your hands on two files from a mchine with SP2 and copy these two files usbuchi.sys and usbport.sys. &nbsp;Then move those two files to your pc with SP3 and copy over the SP3 files. &nbsp;Those files you will find in c:\windows\system32\drivers. &nbsp;Anybody who is having problems with a Dell pc all you have to do is replace the SP3 usb drivers with SP2 drivers.</p>

<p>Can you boot into safe mode? It sounds like you may have the problem with HP's image, in which case the instructions in the main blog will fix it. If that does not work, try calling MS on their tech support line and see if they can help. </p>

		                <p>I have an ASUS A8N32 SLI-Deluxe motherboard w/ an AMD 4600+ CPU. After downloading SP3, it would continusously reboot. Safe mode wouldn&#39;t work either. I finally was able to boot into it with winternals, and roll it back via system restore. </p>
<p>Renaming, or disabling intelppm would not rectify the problem. </p>

		                <p>Symantec has a correction to any corrupt regitry issues. Make sure you run Live Update prior to installing SP3. With this correction, it lookls like you can go back to disabling the AV and the tamper protection until SP3 finishes.</p>
<p>There has been no &quot;final&quot; BIOS update for the A8N-SLI series, just an older beta. Last final BIOS update goes back a few years (Dec 2005).</p>
<p>I have the regular A8N-SLI and installed SP3 on a dual core Opteron without a problem.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem with SP3 [aside from malware and crap which could be present] is that it took MS so long to release SP3. Unlike RTM to SP1 or SP1 to SP2, stuff/junk accumulated in a PC that has been running for so long with Win XP.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ll just save the agravation by wiping my drive and installing XP and SP3 after it.</p>

		                <p>I am having similar problems except even trying to reinstall windows has become a disaster.</p>
<p>I have an LG Laptop running an AMD chip</p>
<p>Once updated to SP3 i had the reboot fault, tried a restore date prior to installation of SP3 on the machine through safe mode as that was the only way to keep the system running with little success as the fault still existed.</p>
<p>I have since reformatted the hard drive and tried reinstalling from the original windows disc and the installation gets so far before the reboot happens again.</p>
<p>Any Suggestions??</p>
<p>next is an FDisk the way it is going or zero my drive.</p>

		                <p>I am having the same 000000FC stop error on Dell Optiplex GX520, Optiplex 745 &amp; Latitude 830. &nbsp;I know it&#39;s a USB problem because when I disconnect the keyboard &amp; mouse the machines boot up to the login screen. &nbsp;As soon as I plug anything in USB I get a BSOD. &nbsp;I tried the fix with copying the usbehci.sys &amp; usbuhci.sys files, but windows wouldn&#39;t even boot then. &nbsp;I can boot up from a DART CD &amp; remove the SP3, but I really need to fix the problem instead of applying a bandaid. </p>
<p>Has anyone with the 000000FC error found a solution yet?</p>

		                <p>I have an HP a1450n (MCE 2005) and had my system freeze (BSOD 0x0000007E) in &quot;Normal Mode&quot; and had to use &quot;Safe Mode&quot; to remove it.</p>
<p>I contacted MS tech support and was told to download SP3 manually, use your tool and install SP3 in &quot;Safe Mode&quot;.</p>
<p>After using your tool and rebooting (without installing SP3) I noticed that &quot;Media Center&quot; did not work properly.</p>
<p>When &quot;Media Center&quot; was started the screen would &#39;flicker&#39; and then it would crash. Since I have MS&#39;s &quot;C&quot; tools it&#39;s debugger screen would pop up (but the &quot;MS Error Reporter&quot; would not.</p>
<p>I got a could of &quot;Debugger Popup&#39;s&quot; that claimed the error was:</p>
<p>&quot;An exception &#39;System.StackOverflowException&#39; has occurred in ehExtHost.exe.&quot;</p>
<p>I chose [Cancel] for the &quot;JIT Debugger&quot; windows and new ones poped up - I continued to cancel them (with MC still in the background) and after numerous cancelations I managed to get the &quot;MS Error Reporter&quot; to pop up TWICE (for MC) - usually it only pops up once for a program.</p>
<p>I managed to send the error reports to MS.</p>
<p>I have complained to MS that I have an OEM install (no disks) and they are unwilling to provide a fix for &quot;Media Center&quot; after MS&#39;s tech broke my system by following his advice.</p>
<p>They have (thus far) refused to help further - I have complained that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>There is NO WAY that I am going to install SP3 in &quot;Safe Mode&quot; and risk not being able to boot at all (thus trashing my HD).</p>
<p>Fortunately I do have the option of using HP&#39;s recover to restore my HD to the way it came from the factory (withOUT loss of any data, except my Registry - thus I would need to re-register all drivers, and re-register any programs that copyprotected and make Registry entries).</p>
<p>This can take a few hours so I wait until I get a virus that I can remove (or my system slows down more than I can tolerate).</p>
<p>The error message &quot;An exception &#39;System.StackOverflowException&#39; has occurred in ehExtHost.exe.&quot; means that this IS clearly MS&#39;s fault (cuz I have PAE on and use &quot;Windows Live OneCare&quot; thus it could not be a virus -- unless WLOC can&#39;t find it).</p>
<p>MS admit your failure and fix your problem!</p>

		                <p>Some feedback for ASUS A8N32 SLI-Deluxe motherboard users affected by continues reboot caused by a BSOD telling you that your board is not ACPI compliant. (Curently disableing the LPT port in bios will be a workaround, that works for me)</p>
<p>Feedback from ASUS Germany (translated):</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>ASUS A8N32 SLI-Deluxe motherboard is fully ACPI complinat. They asked for not to install SP3 untill MS can provide a fix for that.</p>
<p>Feedback from MS Support</p>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
<p>Based on the latest feedback of our customers, the user who has the ASUS motherboard installed will encounter this issue after installing SP3.</p>
<p>The issue has been forwarded to our product group for further research. </p>
<p>Considering the current situation, you can choose to remove SP3 as s temporary workaround and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused.</p>
<p>To remove SP3:</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>Step 1: Remove SP3:</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Method 1: Use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel</p>
<p>1. Click &quot;Start&quot;, click &quot;Run&quot;, type &quot;appwiz.cpl&quot; in the Open box, and then click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<p>2. Click to select the &quot;Show Updates&quot; check box.</p>
<p>3. Click &quot;Windows XP Service Pack 3&quot;, and then click &quot;Remove&quot;.</p>
<p>4. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove Windows XP SP3.</p>
<p>Method 2: Use the System Restore process</p>
<p>1. Click &quot;Start&quot;, click &quot;Run&quot;, type &quot;%SystemRoot%\System32\restore\rstrui.exe &quot;in the Open box, and then click &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<p>2. Click &quot;Restore my computer to an earlier time&quot;, and then click &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
<p>3. Click the date that you installed Windows XP SP3, and then click Installed Window XP Service Pack 3 in the Restore Point box.</p>
<p>4. Click &quot;Next&quot;, and then follow the instructions on the screen to remove Windows XP SP3.</p>
<p>Then, please hide the update notification for SP3 using the steps below:</p>
<p>Step 2: To hide the update notification for SP3:</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>1. Please go to the following webpage to download Windows Service Pack Blocker Tool Kit</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d7c9a07a-5267-4bd6-87d0-e2a72099edb7&amp;DisplayLang=en">www.microsoft.com/.../details.aspx</a></p>
<p>2. Save the file on your Desktop and double click it to run.</p>
<p>3. Choose a folder to extract the files. When the files are all extracted, you will find three files in the folder.</p>
<p>4. Please double click the extracted .exe file to block the SP3 update.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope the above information can be of help with.</p>

		                <p>Jasper, thank you for your detailed explanation of the technical issues involved in upgrading to SP3. I was going to hold off on this upgrade due to news reports that it was buggy with AMD processors... but after reading your clear explanation of the technical issues, running your checker, and temporarily disabling my security software I went ahead and all was well.</p>

		                <p>Thanks Jesper! &nbsp;You saved me from my angry wife! &nbsp;She came home from a trip to find that her computer (Compaq AMD) would no longer boot after the SP3 update. &nbsp;It looked like I was going to be sleeping on the sofa! &nbsp;Well, I followed your instructions to disable the intelppm service in the recovery console. &nbsp;I had to reboot once in safe mode (I don&#39;t know why) and now the PC is working correctly with SP3. &nbsp;You saved my life!</p>

		                <p>I get the continuous reboot cycle. Running HP Media Center with AMD. Tried SP3 install twice. No luck. First time, I was able to uninstall it in Safe Mode. Did a disc cleanup, deleted temp internet files, cookies, and did a defrag. Second attempt would not even boot in Safe Mode. Backed up files before attempting the second time, and a good thing, too. Had to do a system restore. Kinda new at this computing thing. Thinking of trying the sc config intelppm fix. Hmmm,........maybe.</p>

<p>Did the SP3 install twice. One from WinUpdate. One from File. Before the second I disabled Auto-reboot on crash and saw the STOP 0x000000A5. </p>
<p>After researching, found the USB thing, but both installs I did WHILE the USB drive was PLUGGED IN! Found that if I unplug it, it boot fine! If I keep it out, it boots, if it&#39;s plugged in, it crashes. </p>
<p>It&#39;s actually a 2rd OS for Gaming. XP 64 is primary, openSUSE linux is my main OS. Looks like more people will try linux instead of Vista and now XP SP3! (Heard of Ubuntu!)</p>

		                <p>After installing SP3 on an ASUS K8N-DL with Opteron 270s, I get the reboot problem with an IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error. The flash drive solution doesn&#39;t work for me. The simple solution for me is to never allow automatic reboot. If I always specify complete shutdown, the system always boots normally, unless my last session was in Linux; in which case I have to kill the computer during POST, then re-start it. Strange??? Of course, the Linux side of the puter has no problems with reboot. </p>

		                <p>I have an update, after going into the recovery console and trying everything that has been suggested (except inserting a memory card into my primary removable storage device) my computer would not boot. In the recovery console if I typed disable intelppm it would say that the registry entry does not exist or could not be found. So in an act of desperation I inserted a 256meg sd card into my primary removable storage device, and amazingly the computer will now boot. As I&#39;m writing this the computer is running scandisk (the blue screen before logging into windows and checking the drive that I plugged in to my primary ide port that I was going to use to backup what ever I could and then reinstall windows.</p>
<p>For those who are interested my system is as follows; </p>
<p>Mobo: Asus A8nsli32 deluxe</p>
<p>graphix :1x Nvidia extreme N7800 gtx</p>
<p>ram: 2 gig corsair</p>
<p>Harddrive config : 2x westerndigital Sata2 120 gig drives in raid 0 array.</p>
<p>Printer :HP photosmart 3110 All in one.</p>
<p>In the time it has taken me to type this the scan on my new backup drive (250 gig) has only gone through 21 %, so fingers crossed the system will fully boot so that I can reverse and remove service pack 3. Please pray for me......&amp; thanks for reading.</p>

		                <p>This has been very helpful for me. After reading it through now I think I see what is happening to my system. I thought it was that driver being loaded but now I see the real problem is the fact I have a ASUS A8N32 SLI-Deluxe motherboard. I will have to dig around for adapters for the mouse and keyboard but in this case this computer is only used for gaming so I am not worried about getting SP3.</p>

		                <p>I emailed Sony on June 4th detailing a problem where the Intel Centrino Processor Technology Test Utility (ctcenu14.exe) does not run after XP SP3, with an error message of : The verification tool is not supported on this operating system.</p>
<p>Since the Intel Processor Identification Utility (procid.exe) does work correctly after XP SP3, Intel advised me that it must be something in the Sony OEM that is causing the Test Utility to throw the error.</p>
<p>I received a reply from Sony as follows :</p>

<p>Sony doesn&#39;t support XP Service Pack 3. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen various reports which state that by installing the latest(?) nVidia drivers version 175.16 they run into the very same situation. Plugging in a USB stick before booting helped them too get Windows booting. After uninstalling version 175.16 and installing an older version (i.e. 169.21) Windows bootet fine even without an USB stick and the like plugged in.</p>

		                <p>I upgraded to SP3, and I was thrown in endless loops of Reboots, andit really pist me off. First time this happened I reformated and eliminated my slave drive cuz some how it was corrupted during installation. My computer iscustom built with :</p>
<p>A8N32-SLI DELUXE,</p>
<p>AMD X2, 4GB Ram, 360 GB HDD, Dual 8300 GS/SLI</p>
<p>And everythng was fine until the upgrade. When I read all I had to do was move a mouse... So I did... and it worked... But it still pisses me off that how I sat there for a few hours trying to fix this, was caused by a mouse being a USB port...</p>

		                <p>Karen, call HP and see what they say. I would say in all likelihood you have a copy of Symantec's Norton Internet Security on there and that corrupted the computer when you installed SP3. Hopefully HP can send you a disk to boot with. If not, you can build a boot disk using tools you can download on the Microsoft web site, but it is a little complicated. </p>

<p>If you really want to use that old B-adapter, look in the document and find out if your adapter is a V1 or V2 :</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.smcnetworks.cz/data/downloads/Katalogy/Catalogues/WLAN%20Chipset.pdf">www.smcnetworks.cz/.../WLAN%20Chipset.pdf</a></p>
<p>Maybe you can find a newer driver on ADmTek (v1) or Ralink site (v2). </p>
<p>Maybe the best to do yourself a favor and buy a cheap cardbus G-adapter of about 25 euro</p>

		                <p>Dear Dr. Johansson,</p>
<p>I am so relieved to find this Blog (from Maximum PC&#39;s article). About a month ago I installed SP3 directly from Microsoft. This is a machine I built myself and has run fine over a year with an Athlon Dual Core Processor. Install seemed to go fine, rebooted, ran a while then DISASTER.</p>
<p>Froze solid, which hadn&#39;t happened before. Wouldn&#39;t boot. Not even into safe mode.</p>
<p>I proceeded to full-format my C drive and re-install Windows XP Pro, Firewall, Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware, and the new Threatfire. Then I attempted to begin the endless tedium of updating Windows.</p>
<p>That stinking Genu-swine&#39;s Advantage thing told me MY WINDOWS WAS NOT &quot;GENUINE&quot;! Looking at my (gaudy) hologram printed CD of WinXP Pro, trying not to lose my temper (I DON&#39;T like being assumed a theif!). I called Redmond: after an eternity on hold and talking to several wastes-of-oxygen, a senior chair-warmer told me my Product Code is already registered and would have to be un-registered. I told him it was destroyed by their shoddy service pack, and how could I unregister something that doesn&#39;t exist. He wanted me to send in my XP disc for a $50 coupon off Vista (I&#39;ll go Linux first). That seemed to be the whole point of every conversation: sell me Vista. Buy into all the bloat and bugs.</p>
<p> &nbsp; I have seen answers to the BSOD problems, and other bugs I&#39;ve been suffering lately, but can you tell me a legal way to keep my XP before the timer runs out? A friend tells me he can crack the timer and make me a new CD, but I don&#39;t want to go that far unless I have no option. I will not spend $400 on something that makes Win 98 first edition look good.</p>

		                <p>I have the reboot problem with a home-built AMD-based machine. &nbsp;The only way to get into Window at all was to use the XP OEM disk that I purchased and boot into Recovery Console. &nbsp;Once I run chkdsk /r, I can boot one time into Windows (it says it fixed one or more errors). &nbsp;Then it seems to boot fine the next time. &nbsp;If I do a restart, it will not boot (even into safe mode) but I can always get it to start by doing the chkdsk /r from Recovery Console. &nbsp;This is a very strange problem - I have uninstalled SP3 and the problem goes away, so I&#39;m doubting it&#39;s a corrupted driver - but maybe I&#39;m naive. &nbsp;Here are the specs of my machine:</p>
<p>ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe Mobo w/ AMD 6400x2</p>
<p>2 GB RAM (Crucial B)</p>
<p>nVidia 8600 GT (EVGA)</p>
<p>nVidia 6200 &nbsp;</p>
<p>250 GB triple-boot XP, Ubuntu 32, Ubuntu 64</p>
<p>Wireless Logitech Mouse</p>
<p>Wireless Logitech Keyboard</p>
<p>Using built-in HD sound</p>
<p>I disabled the auto-reboot feature after getting Windows to finally boot, and it stops with a 0x00000024 stop error in ntfs.sys.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to get more information? &nbsp;Could this really be a different error being masked somehow - I&#39;m willing to try things, just want to help get this resolved.</p>

		                <p>This is a follow-up to a previous post. &nbsp;Since I was getting the ntfs.sys 0x00000024 error upon boot (after disabling the auto-restart on error in start options), I figured, what the heck - I&#39;m going to try to just copy the ntfs.sys from the original OEM disk. &nbsp;What do you know - the problem seems to be gone - I&#39;m now able to boot into XP SP3 with my AMD. &nbsp;If I notice any weirdness with this - I&#39;ll repost, but just in case this helps someone else, I&#39;m posting this here.</p>

		                <p>I have not found this one. If it is here I am sorry, I missed it: </p>
<p>After installing SP3 on the reboot I received a &quot;boot failure insert cd...&quot; I have an AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600 with ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe MB, NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS, XP Home Edition. Have tried to disable the intelppm, but it was not found on my system. The USB solution did not work either. The only way I have been able to boot my system is the change the boot sequence to boot the CD first. If I let it go it will boot with out going into setup. I have my XP disc in the drive. Have not tried to boot without a disc in CD drive. </p>
<p>Any thoughts on this one?</p>

<p>My machine is a 4 year old, the specs are below</p>

<p>DFI UT 250GB</p>
<p>Seagate 120gb</p>
<p>Seagate 160gb</p>
<p>Nvidia 7600GT</p>
<p>Windows XP SP2 with all updates till Mar2008</p>
<p>my rig is rock solid, havent reformatted it in the last 4 years, no viruses, no worms, etc, and the last time i had a BSOD was &quot;AGES&quot; ago.</p>
<p>So i ran SP3 then encountered an error. Then when i tried to reboot it will just hang, no splash screen of Windows XP. I tried safe mode but it gets stuck in loading the drivers. </p>
<p>Good thing a REPAIR from the Windows XP CD got things to working order again.</p>
<p>it almost gave me a heart attack</p>

		                <p>My problem is now solved: I&#39;ll explain how for others who might still experience the same</p>
<p>issue.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, SP3 RC2 worked well for me on XP Pro SP2.</p>
<p>Except that when I plugged in a USB external drive, the PC restarted straight away. </p>
<p>Not when I inserted a flash drive though.</p>
<p>It also rebooted (when Windows came up) if I attached the USB drive before turning on the PC.</p>
<p>On the same machine, on another partition with XP Pro SP2, the USB drive still worked perfectly..</p>
<p>All I did was to replace USBPORT.SYS (version: &nbsp;5.1.2600.3311) in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers:</p>
<p>First with version 5.1.2600.5512 (final release): THIS DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>Then I replaced it by the SP2 version: 5.1.2600.2180</p>
<p>Everything is back to normal: IT WORKED!</p>
<p>(the idea came from:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/rss.aspx?siteid=17&amp;postID=3447346&amp;forumID=2010">forums.microsoft.com/.../rss.aspx</a>)</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>
<p>My 2nd question remains:</p>
<p>Should one remove RC2 prior to installing the final release?</p>
<p>Or can it be run over it?..</p>

		                <p>R. A. Handsberry: If you have made hardware changes since you originally installed Win XP [i.e. new DVD burner, new CPU, etc.] the WGA may fail as there has been too many changes. I suspect if you had registered Win XP [and not just activated], they could of reset the account for you or give a different serial number. It&#39;s not SP3 that caused the WGA problem but when you re-installed Win XP [from what I can see].</p>

		                <p>I have an Asus A8V running an AMD processor. &nbsp;My desktop was in a continuous reboot for 2 weeks. &nbsp;The fix that worked when nothing else would was to perform a repair installation of XP Professional. &nbsp;I have 2 SATA drives running on my homemade PC, a primary and secondary. &nbsp;I discovered that after several unsuccessful attempts at trying to perform a repair install that if I disconnected the secondary drive I was able to perform that repair installation of XP. &nbsp;Not sure why this was the case but it worked. &nbsp;After the repair installation I haven&#39;t had any addition continuous reboot problems. </p>

		                <p>I&#39;m in charge of several hundred Dell computers and in my testing I&#39;ve experienced multiple instances of the Dell/USB problem on the following Dell models with Intel CPUs: Optiplex GX520, Optiplex 170L, Latitude D620. Ironically the AMD based Optiplex 740 had no problems with SP3. I was beating my head trying to figure out why some computers booted after upgrading to SP3 and some didn&#39;t and in every case unplugging the Dell USB mouse and keyboard allowed those computers that weren&#39;t booting to boot. I don&#39;t have any answers, just more confirmation that there is a serious problem with Dell USB and SP3.</p>

		                <p>Hallo Jesper, I had 2 weeks of black screen looping which would not open up, despite endless recent config/restore etc. Tried the intelppm change to value 4 but intelppm not listed in register. Did the sc config intelppm (etc) that didnt work either. At the time of loading SP3, I also loaded AV8. Being a bit wary of uninstalling SP3 incase it left behind some bits and peces, I took ou t AV8 instead.</p>
<p>Instantly I got my computer back, so this may help others who are having no luck with SP3. Thanks for all the great advice I now know where to look as I am sure SP3 will next rear it&#39;s ugly head.</p>

		                <p>I don&#39;t know if SP3 is the source of my recent problem, but it&#39;s the only reason I can think of.</p>
<p>I have an Asus A8N32-SLI motherboard and a Samsung SH-S183A DVD-writer.</p>
<p>When my DVD-writer was first installed there were some compatibility problems with the motherboard (apparently because it uses SATA, whatever that means), but a techie looked at it, and installed some drivers or something and everything was cool from that point on.</p>
<p>Until I installed XP SP3 a couple of days ago that is. </p>
<p>Now suddenly I can&#39;t get my DVD-writer to work. I tried installing every driver I could find for the DVD-writer and the motherboard, but it still doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>So unless one of you has any idea on how this might be fixed, I guess I have 2 choices: uninstall SP3 or pay a pro to fix my system again...</p>
<p>So thanks Microsoft! And they wonder why so few people are willing to pay for their cr*ppy software...</p>

		                <p>I have an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe, and got caught in the SP3 reboot loop--rebooting before I could read the error. Found your article, unplugged my Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse&#39;s USB dongle. Boots fine..as long as it&#39;s unplugged upon boot.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info. I&#39;ll probably downgrade back to SP2 so that I don&#39;t have to unplug the USB dongle and try SP3 again some other day.</p>

<p>For no apparent reason, computer (an AMD with XP-Home) boots to login screen. Log in, it says &quot;Saving settings...&quot; and &quot;logging out&quot; then returns to login screen. Endless loop.</p>

<p>If you want to shell out $2000 for a Mac plus purchase some of the software to replace what was in Windows [remembering that Mac computers do not have the vast hardware and software selection as Windows]. </p>
<p>You want to go from Leopard 10.5.x to Snow Leopard 10.6.x [when it comes out]? You will have to PAY for the UPDATE.</p>

<p>Long story short XP SP3 install caused the endless reboot loop on my custom built rig w/ Media Center 2005 OEM Cds w/ SP2 and all applicable updates.</p>
<p>After repairing the install and finding I could no longer update my SP2 install I found this article from Microsoft which solved my new problem:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943144">support.microsoft.com/.../943144</a></p>
<p>Read the section titled: Method 1: Register the Wups2.dll file in Windows</p>
<p>Now on to the reboot which is still a problem.</p>
<p>I have been using the F8 key to manually choose the Media Center OS and then it boots as normal everytime but I MUST use the F8 Key.</p>
<p>My error on Blue Screen is HEX A5 (the dreaded ACPI compliance). I am running BIOS revision 1303 which is not the original which was shipped with the MOBO (I flashed it ages ago to update it when I was having seperate issues with my SLi setup which is unrelated *smiley* ). &nbsp;Anyway, all I had to do was unplug the USB keyboard and webcam and the dang OS booted straight to XP SP2. </p>
<p>Your forum here was exactly what I needed and thankfully only a few minutes reading sorted my problem. </p>
<p>I must say I am not convinced I am brave enough &nbsp;to run the SP3 install now after everything is sorted but now I know the problem is the USBs I may try again. Maybe LOL.</p>
<p>Once again many many thanks for this forum, I hope many others will find it as useful as I have.</p>

		                <p>I have a Dell Dimension 8200 Intel Pentium 4 processor. I installed the SP3 (I wish I hadn&#39;t) My computer was ok until I shut it down that night and when I restarted it the next morning I received the error message Stop: C0000218 {registry file failure}</p>
<p>Registry cannot load the hive (file) system root/system 32/config/software/ or it&#39;s log or alternate. It&#39;s corrupt, absent or writable. Beginning duump of physical memory. Dumping physical memory to disk (starts a 75 sec. count) It than reboots to dell screen I press f12 and arrow down to boot from cd however once I press enter it does nothing, does not boot from cd. If I press f8 to disable auto restart it than takes me to the select os screen (two versions of xp on there) both versions when selected will bring me back to the blue screen with the stop error message. I have not been able to boot in safe mode either when this is selected a screen with several scripts appears for about 30 sec and than it goes back to the blue screen w/stop error message. I believe this is all related to the SP3 but that&#39;s only a guess. I am running Norton Security. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve brought the computer in to have data recovery done. They have recommended wiping the hard drive and reloading. I&#39;m not convinced that is necessary at this point after reading all the info on your website and other forums. Any ideas to get my system to boot</p>
<p>would be most helpful and if you haven&#39;t already guessed it I am a true novice. Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>

<p>I just a fixed a Compaq Presario SR2013WM desktop with an AMD proc w/SP3 that had these problems: USB ports not starting or working, computer&#39;s power had to be turned off by pressing the power switch (like old AT systems), and DM showed a floppy drive that did not exist. The fix was to uninstall all MS .NET 1.1 Framework entries in Add/Remove Programs. You can then reinstall .NET 1.1 from Windows Update. The hardware problems went away after the uninstall.</p>

		                <p>Rocky: the best thing I can tell you is to call Microsoft and they can walk you through it. More than likely, the registry is pretty well corrupted so you need something neutral to boot from. I am guessing you had an anti-malware suite on there that corrupted the registry during installation. </p>

		                <p>I got a HP Compaq nx6125 notebook with amd processor.</p>
<p>When trying to install winxp sp3 using a bootable cd the computer shuts down as the install (still in the dos part of the install) says &quot;starting windows&quot;.</p>
<p>The computer simply turns off.</p>
<p>During install I use AC adp.</p>
<p>The bootable cd is not corrupt, it works fine on other notebooks.</p>
<p>I wounder if this could somehow be related to the problem when installing sp3 from within windows?</p>
<p>I also tried updating my bios after a chat with HP tech support.</p>
<p>They said it might be hardware trouble, but I&#39;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

		                <p>I&#39;m trying to install not only SP3 but WinXP SP3 from a bootable cd on my HP Compaq nx6125 notebook.</p>
<p>I have an AMD processor, using latest bios upgrade avalible from HP.</p>
<p>Since reading about the problems with sp3 on HP w. AMD I was thinking that maby my problems are in relation to this.</p>
<p>The problem; During install the notebook shuts down, very unexpectedly.</p>
<p>CD is first boot option in bios.</p>
<p>Using AC adapter during install.</p>
<p>Using a working copy of XP (tried on other, non hp/amd laptop).</p>
<p>The install starts as usual, runs in &quot;dos mode&quot; for a while, it says &quot;starting windows&quot; and then it shuts down.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t reach the part of the install where it asks about the partion.</p>
<p>The fan simply revs down and then the notebook shuts down.</p>
<p>When I boot up again windows works as before attempting re-installing.</p>
<p>Could my problems be related to the SP3 issues on HP notebooks w. AMD processors?</p>
<p>Any thoughts or tips?</p>

		                <p>Wow, great article on a narrow but nasty XP SP3 scenario!</p>
<p>On suppressing AutoChk (the automatic &quot;repair&quot; of the file system after a bad exit), it may be better to do this for particular drive letters by adding parameters to the line in BootExecute, rather than clearing it. &nbsp;This is also more likely to survive events that may re-populate BootExecute, e.g. a Yes when prompted to ChkDsk after reboot because C: is &quot;in use&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, in my experience, these parameter additions have survived, though I&#39;ve not tested a clash between a drive letter to be scanned on a one-off basis, and that one being one I&#39;ve suppressed.</p>
<p>The parameter format is /k:X where X is the drive letter, and it&#39;s added after the command and before the * parameter. &nbsp;So to suppress AutoChk for D:, E: and F: while allowing it for everything else, use this:</p>
<p>/k:D /k:E /k:F *</p>
<p>I leave AutoChk to &quot;fix&quot; Vista&#39;s must-be-NTFS C:, given that nothing else can maintain that, but suppress it for all letters D: through Z: - I don&#39;t have that many drives, but it helps protect USB storage I may have attached. &nbsp;I find Vista (nearly?) always wants to &quot;check for errors&quot; when I plug in flash drives etc.!</p>

		                <p>Hi</p>
<p>I installed XP SP3 on my Compaq machine and blue screen appeared showing STOP 0x0000007c error. I didnt know the solution (disable intelppm) and tried to restore system with ERD commander, run some tests, repair XP using windows cd. After that the error changed to 0x0000006b and I found out the solution, but it was to late. Now I am stuck with this error, cannot run safe mode (could not before, when 0x7 appeared), chkdsk /r seems to stop at 55% . 0x6b has something to do with Roxio, which I have never installed.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		                <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having very similar difficulties to opetnick (above this comment). &nbsp;I do not know if I am getting an error code or not, I just know that I always get to the blue screen of &quot;death&quot; after I turn on my Compaq Laptop. &nbsp;After this occurs, it goes into a constant reboot cycle, and when it boots another blue screen, and it happens again and again. &nbsp;This is a big issue for me because now I cannot even enter into Safe Mode to recover my data because it reboots/ gives off another blue screen there also. &nbsp;Please help me in recovering my data so I can get rid of this operating system and do a fresh install. &nbsp;Thank you very much for your help.</p>

		                <p>I posted back about a month ago and said I was able to boot my AMD after installing the ntfs.sys file from my OEM XP install disk. &nbsp;I ended up uninstalling SP3, as it was too unstable, and said I would repost if I changed. &nbsp;It seems that there may be a new version of the SP3 download - version 1.1 - and I&#39;m a glutton for punishment, so I&#39;m going to give it another go. Taking all the precautions I possibly can. &nbsp; See you on the other side.</p>

		                <p>Encountered this problem with a brand spanking new out of the box ASUS F3E series notebook after updating to SP3. While in the XP pro loading screen, the process suddenly slows down to a crawl, to the point where each of the scrolling blue bar segments loads in well over a minute and one could also see each segment loads bit by bit. This would go on for about 10 minutes until the system reboots and goes to the &quot;Windows failed to load correctly&quot; display.

		                <p>Not an AMD problem for me, but still a problem!</p>
<p>- Asus P5B SE Motherboard</p>
<p>- Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E4600 @2.40GHz</p>
<p>- 2x1GB of Kingston RAM</p>
<p>- Asus EN8500 GT Graphics Card</p>
<p>Had to reinstall Windows XP Professional (SP1) from original CD.</p>
<p>After I installed SP2, it ran without a problem.</p>
<p>After installing SP3 it went into the crazy reboot loop you&#39;re addressing here:</p>
<p>- Asus logo comes up (I can go into the BIOS setup if I try)</p>
<p>- Windows starts to come up, but immediately it flashes the blue screen and reboots. It&#39;s too fast for me to see if it starts a memory dump or not. If you&#39;re interested, I can disable reboot on failure and maybe see the error code.</p>
<p>- I can go into the Windows boot menu by pressing F8, but Safe Mode has the same problem.</p>
<p>Any update on a possible fix?</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; regards</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper, having a similar &quot;boot loop&quot; problem with XP SP3. I have a dual boot menu (with 4 options), and when I let it boot up normally it will just reboot, endlessly. But if I arrow-down in the boot menu and then back up to the preferred installation option, it goes into Windows normally! I have an AMD A8N32-SLI Deluxe mobo, 2 hdd&#39;s, 1GB RAM. I don&#39;t think this is specific to SP3 because I also had it before the XP SP3 install</p>

		                <p>Compaq SR1511NX (Sempron 3100+) does the &quot;reboot - flash BSOD too fast to read - reboot&quot; routine. &nbsp;My &quot;fix&quot; was to uninstall SP3 using Add/Remove Programs in Safe Mode and turn off Automatic Updates.</p>
<p>Between this and weird issues with updates locking up my Vista machines, I&#39;ve given up on Automatic Updates - I just run the utility once a week or so and pick what I what to install. &nbsp;That way I&#39;ll hopefully at least get some warning if an update is buggy and can wait for one that works.</p>
<p>But I really think it&#39;s complete BS that Microsoft and HP/Compaq are basically pointing fingers at each other and saying &quot;It&#39;s THEIR fault!&quot; instead of taking care of their customers and working together to fix this problem. &nbsp;It&#39;s great that people like Jesper are willing to sacrifice so much of their own time and energy trying to help Microsoft&#39;s/HPC&#39;s customers, but it&#39;s really not his problem. &nbsp;It&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s/HPC&#39;s problem, and they should fix it.</p>
<p>If necessary, they should be forced to fix it with a class-action lawsuit. &nbsp;Any lawyers reading this who might be interested?</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper, I&#39;m unable to run the tool. Downloaded it via Firefox 2 (and also IE) OK. Saved as .vbs file per Win Explorer. But when I double click the file it opens in Notepad rather than executing. The file is listed as a Type = VBScript file in Win Explorer. Copy &amp; paste to a different folder has the same undesirable result. Thanks for the excellent info.</p>

		                <p>Hi again Jesper. Strangest thing here. After reading some other forums on the ASUS boards, I came across this possible fix; at least it worked for me. Here is the quote from the forum: &quot;Don&#39;t disable ACPI. First clear CMOS and then go in Bios and disable APM and serial port. Don&#39;t disable perallel port.</p>
<p>If you try to install Win XP SP3 a USB drive or a USB stick on a USB port may solve the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, I went into BIOS setup, did NOT disable the parrallel port, did NOT clear CMOS, and only disabled the APM, rebooted, and VOILA! It works! No more &quot;boot loop&quot;. BTW, I had been using the trick of plugging in my USB Blackberry on boot up and that was working too.</p>
<p>And can you tell me what am I actually doing when I disable the APM in the BIOS? I still have ACPI compliant computer, according to Device Manager. So far I haven&#39;t seen any adverse effects yet, but it&#39;s only been a few hours, and 3 reboots.</p>

		                <p>I worked with two Microsoft representatives to try and get SP3 to work after install. Both were unable to help me after weeks of continually making changes and then trying to install SP3. They even sent me a new copy of Windows XP Pro and SP3, to no avail. It is a good thing I used Norton Ghost 10 and was able to reinstall my original image after each try. I have spent hours trying.

Try this, and that, but keep in mind you might completely screw up your whole computer. &nbsp;come on. &nbsp;Microsoft should be able to do better than this. &nbsp;I lost track how many things are there you can try just to install one stinking service pack. &nbsp;Oh microsoft shove up your ass. &nbsp;for real. &nbsp;Who do you have writing these service packs monkeys. &nbsp;You can&#39;t tell me these blooming idiots didn;t know when they released sp3 that there was going to be problems with AmD processors. &nbsp;Of course your MVP is trying to dance all around that and blame it on everything but microsoft writing a very poor sp. &nbsp;Oh no sp is great it&#39;s your system..get off it. &nbsp;Microsoft know full well what types of computers there software namely xp is installed on. &nbsp;Micromud just either no.1 released something they new to be of poor quality, now lets look at why they woudl do that. &nbsp;Could it be that instead of getting their old computer fixed lots of folks with just buy another one being forced to use yet another crappy not ready to be released software named uh what would that be. &nbsp;OH YEah VISTA, &nbsp; Hang on going to get my barf bag. &nbsp;You can&#39;t even order a system with xp it is all vista. &nbsp;That system is so bad the only place it belongs is the trash can. &nbsp;it is way too bulky, and uses way too much HDD space as well as ram. &nbsp;To run something just above basic you need 8 ram, and usually a new graphics card, and a new cooling system. &nbsp;Vista Ready my ASS. to run vista ultimate good god, at least the way it should run you need so much in upgrades you need to go into the kids, or grandkids college funds . &nbsp;My computer is a Media center. &nbsp;All i had was the the re-boot loop. &nbsp;I stopped it right away so damage came to my machine. &nbsp;I Restored it to 5 minutes before sp3 which I put there on purpose knowing it was probably junk. &nbsp;lol. &nbsp;Oh yeah I did do that in safe mode. &nbsp;I am done with my ranting for now. &nbsp;All of these things were discussed in mostly may. &nbsp;I have yet to see improvement on microsofts part to fix this problem, that doesn&#39;t require the customer stand on there head and sing yankee doodle. &nbsp;I would like to see either a improved sp3 that is called just that for people with amd processers.Or two, find a way. for us to stop that annoying service pack trying to install itself. &nbsp;I have been able to do that with other things. &nbsp;Like please don&#39;t show this update to me again. &nbsp;I can&#39;t find that button for this one. &nbsp;I want it workable or to go away Good GOD.</p>

		                <p>I beleive (just a hunch) the problem on the a8n32-sli deluxe stems from the board being one of, if not, the first true 16x sli s939 boards. &nbsp;The hybrid design of using the C51 NB with the IGP disable/missing on an AMD system vs using the c19 as on intel systems is hard to overlook. &nbsp;Furthermore, to my knowledge, the only other x16 sli Asus s939 board used an ATI chipset. &nbsp;The later generation nforce4 chipsets ended up being fairly standard (separately) for the Intel/AMD camps. &nbsp;So it probably came down to this motherboard being frankensteinish and the possibility of corporate neglect on someone&#39;s part- because it is easier to make a mass-applied solution that only skirts a very minuscule minority of cases than to work out (and pay for) something that is mutually exclusive for every situation. &nbsp;I think the fact that aside from all the other generational chipsets and motherboards, with the A8n32-sli Deluxe being singularly named as problematic here, the alignment of circumstances is hard to ignore. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this doesn&#39;t make things seem better. &nbsp;MS most likely won&#39;t issue something- they&#39;ve already got the pre-check for oems built into live-update. &nbsp;And considering Asus hasn&#39;t issued a non-beta bios in over a year, chances are a portion of people are going to perpetually have a usb dongle connected to their computers.</p>

		                <p>I have a Custom AMD 64 X2 Brisbane based computer running a ASUS M2N-MX SE plus ACPI, ACPI 2.0 compliant bios enable, Asus EN7300 GT 256mb 128 bit (Gefrorce 7300 gt), 4GB DDR800. Windows XP pro Version 2002 Student W/SP2 PN E85-03210</p>
<p>I tried to install SP3 and got a scrambled screen and it appeared to have corrupted the Nvidia driver after which is the 175.19 bundle, file 4.0.100.1190 32bit.</p>
<p>I got the endless reboot deal however windows never halted on error and can not pull a address. I was able to enter safe mode by F8 and it worked however reloading the graphics driver from here did not work, only loading a default driver then it did but ran worse on graphics, after entering into windows on SP3 with a MS default driver I tried to install Nvidia and upon reboot the same thing started to happen, I also tried the ASUS driver on the disk and still no avail.</p>
<p>I ended up reverting to SP2 and reinstalling my drivers.</p>
<p>This is a fresh build XP pro OS SP2 with less than 6 months on the build clock. It has been through a couple different setups both Motherboard and video including a change over to X2 64bit processors, but always was running a AMD, I was running this build on a 32bit AMD athlon until I eventually got to this point now, I questioned to reinstall and did once but never reformated, the registery has been in place for years and gets grooming once in awhile. Only the drivers in use are installed, old drivers are uninstalled or deleted and edited out of registery.</p>
<p>One way I didn&#39;t try was to load MS default drivers before installing SP3. This Motherboard also has IGP which is only enabled if no PCI-e graphics card is detected even if you select it for priority and use the port it will not work (may work for a few boots) if you have a PCI-e.</p>
<p>I have all the updates SP2 allows including Net Framework 3.0 minus IE7.</p>

<p>Changed out the motherboard, processer and memory from an Emachine W4065. Left the hd with xp sp3 installed.</p>
<p>New board -MSI k9vgm am2</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;This is your problem, you changed out your MoBo on a OEM machine using a OEM software bundle installed, Can you enter Bios?</p>
<p>If so, you need to Purchase a Retail version of Windows to be a custom build or to do major upgrades like a MoBo.</p>
<p>In most cases OEM software OS is tagged to the original machine and can only be installed if these instances are matching since you replaced the MoBo the OEM key and serials are tossed out the window so to speak. Even if you had the disks you may still have to purchase a license that allows this upgrade.</p>

		                <p>I have 3 PC«s all with the ASUS A8N-32SLI Deluxe</p>
<p>1. AMD64 X2 4600+</p>
<p>2. AMD64 X2 4200+</p>
<p>3. AMD64 3700+</p>
<p>It started on the 2. when installing Sp3 with the described startup/boot issue. Found this site and got it booted up in safe mode and simply uninstalled Sp3. Then it ran fine again.Decide to NOT install Sp3 then.</p>
<p>We have btw 2 labtops,both with AMD turion PCU«s where Sp3 runs without any problems, they were the first ones wich i installed Sp3 on.</p>
<p>Recently my number 3 Pc broke down due to some fault in the PSU. Took it all apart and tested each part seperately to find what caused the failure.</p>
<p>When i reasebled it all i made a complete reinstall of XP with a slipstreamed Sp2 version. Then installed Sp3 - no problem all started up. After installing the ASUS drivers/utillity it again boote/reboote in a loop.</p>
<p>It seems like it has something to do with the drivers for the MB. Btw have the latest bios vers.1404 from ASUS.</p>

		                <p>Re the a8n32-sli deluxe board and its well documented problems with SP3, someone in the ASUS forums has actually posted a decent solution. &nbsp;I&#39;ve followed it, tested it and can report back not one BSOD.</p>
<p>NB this solution is for a clean windows xp install including SP3, not an upgrade by downloading and installing SP3.</p>
<p>Steps.</p>
<p>1. Back up all your important data and program install files (obviously).</p>
<p>2. Ensure you are using BIOS 1303 at the default BIOS settings (ie no need to disable anything). &nbsp;Use the DOS or Windows utilities to change to this bios if required</p>
<p>3. From Asus website download and install the &quot;ACPI driver for ATK 0110 virtual device &quot; program in the utilities section. &nbsp;This is critical as it solves the compatability with ACPI issue.</p>
<p>4. Create your install cd, the best way being with nlite to slipstream sp3</p>
<p>5. Do your fresh install of xp with sp3 and enjoy</p>

<p> &nbsp;more then likely you are experiencing the reboot because the original Cd came with a Sata driver for either a single drive, or a Raid based set up. While in Sp2 please look at the </p>
<p>Control panel, system icon, device manager, </p>
<p>Ide ata properties, or SCSI tab</p>
<p>It should tell you which drivers you are using. </p>
<p> &nbsp;Oem images contain specific drivers for your motherboard. While Sp3 Does not contain driver images created after 2002. You probably need a recent driver from intel created for your motherboard chipset.</p>
<p> &nbsp;Please do a search for your system motherboard chipset. Should explain the process in a manual for your motherboard.</p>

		                <p>I want to thank you for your articles. I installed SP3 last month, and immediately started having problems with NAV 2008 and also with crashes and programs not loading up. My &quot;solution&quot; was to uninstall SP3 and Norton, and install AVG antivirus. My computer is finally stable, except for one pesky problem - I can&#39;t run a &quot;full&quot; virus scan without a crash. I can pick areas to scan, though, so I feel pretty protected. If anyone has a fix for this antivirus/malware problem even after uninstalling SP3, I&#39;d sure appreciate it!!!!</p>

		                <p>Ok, so I own an alienware computer that was built about 2 years ago. &nbsp;I had no real problems with it until about a month ago I had to replace the processor and motherboard (originally intel) because they had fried (when the processor was installed alienware improperly installed the heatsink, so consequently it worked well for 2 years before giving out). &nbsp;Anyway I replaced the original mother board and processor with AMD 790FX and AMD Phenom X4, not because I particularly hate intel but AMD was the only processor I could find without going online and waiting a week. &nbsp;This new configuration worked just fine for a few weeks until I mindlessly installed Microsoft&#39;s new SP3 update that had been annoying me on my desktop. &nbsp; Next time it came to boot my machine it would begin to boot all the way through the Windows XP screen that has the 3 blue bars that are loading, then the screen would go black and the monitor would shut off because &quot;no signal.&quot; &nbsp;After endlessly trying to get it to boot I finally got into safe mode. &nbsp;From there I tried system restore, I unistalled SP3, I uninstalled my antivirus software, I tied the USB trick, and I used the program you made (it didn&#39;t find IntelPPMonAMD.vbs). &nbsp;I am all out of ideas here, my last resort is just to load my very old image DVD from the factory, but losing all that data from my hard disk is such a pain in the ass. &nbsp;I was wondering if anyone had any ideas and also I just wanted to put it out there that yes SP3 screwed up another custom machine.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

		                <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an AMD board, the same one giving everyone trouble:</p>
<p>S8N32-SLI Deluxe.</p>
<p>Even after a fresh install of windows with SP2 (not SP3!) I was getting ACPI blue screens every time I loaded up. I can confirm that the USB flash drive trick allowed me to boot into windows; very strange.</p>
<p>In the end, I disabled parallel port in the BIOS. That seems to have done the trick; I can boot now without a USB flash drive. I&#39;d love to know what&#39;s going on here.</p>

		                <p>RubberduckDK: From Brendan on July 23rd, could be that ACPI driver. Depending on your needs, it&#39;s not really required. You will have a decision to make in early 2010 as by then, Microsoft won&#39;t support any SP2 based security fixes. Adide from the ATK/Probe stuff I think the remainder of the &quot;motherboard&quot; drivers are generic. Didn&#39;t install the SATA/IDE drivers as the ones in Win XP are fine.. You can always install SP2 on a fresh system, install SP3. Install one set of drivers and reboot. Install the next driver. Reboot. Do until a problem and then you found the culprit.</p>

		                <p>May found another [small] issue with SP3 but it needs to be confirmed. If you use a Logitech mouse and/or keyboard with the SetPoint software and if you remove or upgrade the software, you may not be able to use the tools. Windows itself detects them as the basic HID-compliant devices instead of from Logitech. Unsure also if SP3 botches the tools after installing.</p>

		                <p>As an owner of an A8N32-SLI Deluxe, who had the above-described STOP error upon attempted install of SP3, I attempted to find out from Microsoft when they would modify their install packages. MS insists this is a MoBo issue:</p>
<p>Paraphrasing what I was told: &quot;Hardware manufacturers are responsible for making their products compatible with MS platform. Microsoft will make no effort to change SP3 to accommodate a single hardware manufaturer, so please contact the Mobo manufacturer to a BIOS update.&quot; I went ahead and just got off the phone with ASUS support. Guess what they told me:</p>
<p>This is a Microsoft issue. Other MoBos are affected (as far as I know, this is not true for this particular type of problem -- refer to this thread and Jesper&#39;s own analysis). ASUS will NOT be making any changes to the recommended BIOS to address the problem. Users of ASUS&#39; affected MoBos will just have to live with SP2 during the remaining life of the Mobo or the OS. Period. The end. Tough luck.</p>
<p>The technician was polite but absolutely clear. If I didn&#39;t like it I was free to contact the R&amp;D people in China:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:tsd@asus.com.cn"><span style="font-size:small;color:#0000ff;font-family:Times New Roman;">tsd@asus.com.cn</span></a></p>
<p>I suggest that my fellow A8N32-SLI Deluxe owners bombard the heck out of the people at that email, and complain as loudly and repeatedly as possible.</p>
<p>A8N32-SLI Deluxe is a higher end Mobo, not a cheapo crap shoot. One purchases from ASUS because they supposedly have a good reputation for reliability and support. Based on the way they have been handling this problem, this reputation is clearly undeserved.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t say very much positive about Microsoft&#39;s tech support people either. They blamed the hardware people. Later, when they sent me a follow up email, inviting me to respond. ALL my emails were bounced back for having invalid email adresses (I used the email address I was instructed to use).</p><div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Help! You seem to be the only one to have a handle on the SP3 problems.</p>
<p>My problem is somewhat different to the ones that you have described. I installed SP3 and it booted up OK first time around with the exception that the screen display was VGA and very slow. I have an ATI Raedon 9600 series graphics card so I downloaded the latest drivers and tried to setup but the setup could not find the graphics card. I tried to manually install the drivers but with no success. At this point I thought I would reboot, get into safe mode and try and install the graphics card there.</p>
<p>When I tried to reboot I could not get into safe mode, the bootup routine got past the bios, the raid screen and into the XP splash screen with the blue line and then nothing but a blank screen! I am assuming therefore that if it gets this far in the bootup it can access the hard disks. There seems to be nothing that I can do to avoid this sequence. The computer seems to be on and the hard disks are working as I can access them through the network but I have no screen display. I have also tried this with two different monitors and two different graphics cards.</p>
<p>When I tried to boot off the CD I get to the setup blue welcome screen, type F6 for the RAID setup get to where it asks for the RAID drivers in the floppy drive and then it cannot see the disk in the floopy drive so no alternative but to exit setup via F3.</p>
<p>When I try to enter recovery console it then tells me that it cannot find the hard disk so again no alternative but to exit.</p>
<p>My system is (from memory) Athlon processor, don&#39;t know what motherboard I&#39;ve got, 2No. Western Digital WD1600 150Gig hard disks on a mirrored RAID array and an ATI Raedon 9600 series graphics card.</p>
<p>Any suggestions as to how to get into the system would be greatly appreciated.</p>

		                <p>After having been told by phone by an ASUS tech support staff-person (see 4 posts above) that I was out-of-luck . . . that it was not ASUS responsibility to make their motherboards compatible with SP3 (preceded by Microsft&#39;s similar refusal to accept any responsibility). I decided to try my luck with complaining in writing to ASUS. Lo and behold they answered with what has GOT to be the craziest-sounding rigmarole troubleshooting. Are they playing games? What do you think? How the heck is this supposed to tell us whether it is safe to install SP3? What the heck is all this silliness supposed to actually *DO* to make the MoBo work with SP3? Their email reply appears below. Comments appreciated:</p>
<p>***********************</p>
<p>**ASUS reply**</p>
<p>Please try the following troubleshooting:</p>
<p>Turn the system off and unplug the power cord from the power supply.</p>
<p>Make sure the ATX 12V volt power supply is plugged in. Connect an external speaker to the green port on the MB to hear the system post (vocal post) message. disconnect the Hard disk, CD-Rom and floppy disk drives from the motherboard; </p>
<p>Take the cpu, memory, and video card out, take the CMOS battery out and move the CLRTC jumper from pin 1&amp;2 to pin 2&amp;3 for about 20 seconds. </p>
<p>Put the jumper back to pin 1&amp;2, install the battery, connect the power cord and turn on the system for about 15 seconds. </p>
<p>Turn the system on, the system should speak &quot;NO CPU INSTALLED&quot; Turn the system off and reinstall CPU, heat sink and CPU fan. </p>
<p>Turn the system on, the system should speak &quot;SYSTEM FAIL MEMORY TEST&quot; Turn it off and install memory.</p>
<p>Turn the system on, the system should speak &quot;SYSTEM FAIL VGA TEST&quot; Turn it off and install and video card. </p>
<p>connect the monitor and turn the system on. If every thing works you should see display on the monitor.</p>
<p>If this did not help, please contact ASUS tech support at 812-282-ASUS and request tech assistance.</p>

		                <p>A further little SP3 foible! After an apparently perfectly normal SP3 installation, the Winfast 760-series (SIS chipset) motherboard machine would not boot. It got to the point past the initial Windows XP screen, where the screen goes blank and the mouse cursor appears, then it sat there for ever. The machine would boot into safe mode and into VGA mode, but accepting the Windows offer to &quot;improve&quot; the display again produced a dead screen. It seemed likely the on-board SIS video driver had been corrupted somehow. Sure enough, re-installing the AGP and video drivers solved the problem.</p>

<p>The Logitech SetPoint issue is not related to SP3. False alarm. [Meanwhile I&#39;m going back and forward via Email and no solution to my issue....]</p>
<p>Dave in VJO:</p>
<p>I am really thinking of not buying an ASUS mobo for my next system. I can not believe they can&#39;t do a simple fix for this problems others are having. It really makes them look bad. I actually agree that it&#39;s not Microsoft that should fix the issue. If ASUS has a problem with 1 model then what they did with that model is non-standard. Why is it that no other mobo manufacturer has the problem. Plain and simple - the mobo is defective. Surprised they didn&#39;t say to switch to Vista or Linux.</p>

		                <p>I am also in netsec and telling people to totally disable their security solutions before they install sp3 is a very bad thing to do. If they are not behind some type of NAT router or firewall they will be completely wide open to the malware of the Internet. Average lifetime of that senario is about 4 minutes until they will be compromised. Either way their computer will not be working.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve downloaded your &quot;removeIntelPPMonAMD.vbs&quot; Tool and run. The report says &quot;The intelppm key does not exist on this computer. You should be ready to install Windows XP Service Pack 3&quot;</p>
<p>AM REALLY SAFE? I saw a comment of &quot;# &nbsp;EC said on 14 May, 2008 02:29 PM&quot;!! Having the Same Problem!</p>
<p>Bottomline is that my automatic update is Turned On and it has already downloaded 82% of SP3 and I can&#39;t stop it! or I don&#39;t know How to Stop it.</p>
<p>Any Idea?</p>
<p>Would be grateful if you (Jesper Johansson) reply me on my email:hades.bgd@hotmail.com </p>

<p>The succesful bootup was a fluke, and the machine did not reboot again afterwards. &nbsp;Got stuck back in the cycle.</p>
<p>Seems you have to very flukey with mashing F8 at the right time make it load. &nbsp;I had success 2 times in about 20 attempts.</p>
<p>The flash drive solution did not work, &nbsp;but replacing the USB mouse with a PS2 mouse DID work.</p>

		                <p>I originally bought my AMD Sempron PC from HP, but recently I had to replace the motherboard due to careless handling when trying to replace the processor that had overheated. The replacement is an Asus M2A-VM HDMI, still using AMD. After some initial problems I managed to convince Microsoft to let me use the original OEM XP Home for the rebuilt computer.</p>
<p>After installing SP3 I experienced the endless reboot loop. Luckily I found this blogg after successfully booting into safe mode. Thanks a lot for the tool, it worked fine for me!</p>

		                <p>To whom it may concern.</p>
<p>Thank you very very much for the following instruction.</p>
<p>If you have an AMD-based computer, however, you do not need the intelppm driver and can disable it. Boot into Safe Mode by hitting the F8 key as above, but select Safe Mode instead. You will need your Administrator account to log on in safe mode. To disable the driver, take the following steps:</p>
<p>If you booted into the recovery console, from a command prompt, run &quot;disable intelppm&quot;</p>
<p>If you booted into safe mode you can run &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot;</p>
<p>I have a Compaq Presario with an AMD processor.</p>
<p>After installing SP3 (of course I didn&#39;t follow the backup instructions! How many CDs would it take to back up 21G?) </p>
<p>I had the the apparently common reboot problem.</p>
<p>After following this:</p>
<p>If you booted into safe mode you can run &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot;</p>
<p>it worked.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p><div style="clear:both;"></div>

		                <p>One last comment from me...</p>
<p>My problem was fixed by replacing the USB mouse with a PS2 mouse, but when I got hold of an adaptor I found that my USB mouse (Logitech G5 laser) did not work in the PS2 port.</p>
<p>I wanted to continue using my Logitech mouse, and thought I would have to remember to unplug it every time I booted up - not a good situation.</p>
<p>Today I tried one last setup, and I am pleased to report that it was successful!</p>
<p>If I plug a PS2 mouse AND a USB mouse into my computer, it boots up perfectly and the USB mouse can be used. &nbsp;The old ps2 mouse is hidden away behind the machine and need never be touched again.</p>
<p>Finally I have a solution that seems permanent, and I can forget this problem ever happened.</p>
<p>All that remains is for me to offer Jesper my sincere gratitude for providing this blog.</p>
<p>Without finding this site I would have undoubtedly ended up wiping my HDD and starting afresh.</p>
<p>Major kudos to you my friend.</p>

		                <p>Hey, wow i just have to say, a great thorough &nbsp;article that helped me understand a lot.</p>
<p>I Have a AMD Athlon 64 proc with the A8N-SLI Deluxe motherboard and OEM windows and i was getting the Stop: 0x000000A5 blue screen after installing SP3. Inserting a memory stick did help me allow the computer to boot, and i system restored to before i installed SP3, but i continued to need the memory stick. I called microsoft to see if i could get a permanent fix instead of always needing a flash drive. First day they told me to update my bios, which i did. After having a &quot;research team&quot; call me back on the second day, and taking remote control of my computer i started getting a different blue screen i think it was 0x019 or something. </p>
<p>In summary, i weep for other users with the A8N-SLI deluxe mobo&#39;s, i was unable to find a solution once i started getting this second blue screen, I had to resort back to an ancient image, which was basically a clean windows install.

It did go to safe mode, and I ran your intelppm disable suggestion, and stuck a spare flashdrive on. BOOTED RIGHT UP !! Don&#39;t know which fix worked, or both, but you saved me endless hours, for which I&#39;m grateful.</p>

		                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks to Jesper for passing on this info. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been working all weekend troubleshooting the BSOD on boot. &nbsp;I finally went out and bought a new disk drive and built it up to SP3 and after it rebooted after Sp3 I had the same problem that I started with. &nbsp;Only then did I do some searching and found this websitre. &nbsp;U nfortunately, my mobo is the Asus A8N32-SLI Deluxe. &nbsp;Lucky for me, I tried the &quot;boot with a flash drive plugged in&quot; trick and it booted! &nbsp;So I went back to my other hard disk and it booted as well. &nbsp;This trick saved me the arduous task of building the new system up. &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;I backed out the 9 hotfixes that were installed on top of SP3 and then backed out SP3. &nbsp;I am back to where I was...a working system. &nbsp;Now I need to find out what MS intends to do. &nbsp;Since the critical updates are dependent on SP3, I am now stuck without the security related patches.</p>

<p>I described my problem in my last post, a couple posts up, i have since been able to install and have SP3 run successfully on my A8N32-SLI deluxe mobo. I went into the BIOS under the advanced tab, and the option that deals with the IRQ&#39;s i just disabled the first option there: the serial port. It booted fine, didnt even need the flash drive in to help it boot. Hope this helps someone.</p>

		                <p>Techie said: &quot;I think the best way is to roll back to SP2 and stay away from installing SP3 at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Techie. What happens in 18 months when Microsoft stops supporting SP2 security updates? Go to Vista? Reformat? Outside of these issues which either have solutions or decent workarounds, nothing else will happen. Both of my SP3 installs went fine. Did about a half dozen others without an issue.</p>

<p>I do blame ASUS. Why is it that just *ONE* motherboard in all the motherboards available have this problem? I&#39;d call it a defective motherboard. It is ASUS&#39;s fault. I have an ASUS mobo [luckily not the one with the issue] and I may not buy an ASUS mobo again.</p>
<p>Have you complained to ASUS or left that to everyone else? You should be complaining to ASUS. They seem to stop supporting their hardware quite fast. 6 months after I bought my mobo, they issued the last non-beta BIOS update. The beta BIOS update has been sitting there for almost 2 years.</p>
<p>As for replying to an Email, just about every company uses invalid generic reply addresses to a generic Email. They want you to use the link in the Email. Did you use the link? I guess not.</p>

		                <p>Gisabun: Not sure why your rude and hostile post was necessary. I will reply courteously, nevertheless.</p>
<p>Regarding ASUS. Please search for my initial posts (July 30, I believe) in this thread. It would appear that your testy comments indicate you did not see my initial posts. You will see, if you do take the time to read them, that I, indeed *did* contact ASUS. Repeatedly.</p>
<p>As for the following:</p>
<p>&quot;. . . just about every company uses invalid generic reply addresses to a generic Email. They want you to use the link in the Email. Did you use the link? I guess not.&quot;</p>
<p>Your guess was wrong. That is the danger with guessing. Again, if your read my initial post, I did, indeed, use precisely the link supplied by MS on two separate occasions. I also used the link specifically supplied to contact a supervisor, constituting a third attempt to work with MS. All emails generated pursuant to their instruction and supplied links were bounced back. I find this unacceptable.</p>
<p>Frankly, as far as I am concerned, it is *both* MS and ASUS&#39; problem. They should be working together to locate exactly which compenent of the SP3 package causes the incompatibility with the MoBo, iunstead of childishly palming the problem off on the customer.</p>
<p>I must agree with you about ASUS&#39;s appalling disrespect towards affected customers. I wish enough pressure could be made to bear on this company, and it surprises me that this has not happened. The A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard was not a limited production MoBo, but rather in fairly wide use (so I am told . . . I am open to being corrected on this), and if this is true, I am guessing many people have been harmed by this situation.</p>

<p>imho this is a significant Microsoft problem. &nbsp;Asus has made a ton of boards, and this is a very popular one. &nbsp;Clearly Microsoft missed a compatibility test in their lab for this very common hardware combo. &nbsp;It works fine for years and then dies after SP3 - how easy can that be to test? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. I did blow a gasket [or in this case maybe a memory chip]. From your August 17th post, it did not mention anything of a previous post [and already this pages is very, very, very long. So I did not know your venting was related to a previous message.</p>
<p>That said, from the quotes you gave in the other message, ASUS is passing the buck onto Microsoft. They claim that other mobos have issues but I haven&#39;t seen anything to that affect and there is no definitive proof from this page that there is another.</p>
<p>Most companies generally will include an address like &quot;no_reply@asusdoesntcare.com.cn&quot;. As for the links in Microsoft pages that didn&#39;t work, that&#39;s strange. I have contacted Microsoft a number of time [including a couple of weeks ago on trying to install Vista SP1 on a laptop] without an issue.</p>
<p>In some ways you can say from the Microsoft point of view that if you want your hardware to work with Windows it&#39;s the hardware manufacturer that has to make it work with Windows and not Microsoft to fix it. Unsure why Microsoft even helped in the IntelPPM mess when it was HP who dropped the ball there [except HP is big, ASUS ain&#39;t].</p>
<p>Many of the Microsoft territories [i.e. UK, Canada] and the US itself have It advisors. Maybe getting ahold of them. Try blogs.technet.com but you&#39;ll have to dig. </p>

		                <p>Gisabun: I disagree with your strong inclination to completely take Microsoft off the hook here:</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that &quot;if you want [ASUS] hardware to work with Windows it&#39;s [ASUS] that has to make it work with Windows and not Microsoft to fix it.&quot; However, that is not quite how it happened here. ASUS&#39;s MoBo was indeed already fully compatible with WindowsXP when the MoBo was relased (and through SP2), and everyone was happy. Don&#39;t forget that it was Microsoft who came in **afterwards** and changed the OS out from under ASUS by releasing SP3. If MS is going to change the rules of the game after the hardware has been out on the market for a long time (and indeed is no longer being offered for sale), it is MS who bears some responsibility to make sure its tweaking of its platform wont pull the rug out from under hardware manufacturers who had been compatible with the earlier versions of the OS, and wont disenfranchise innocent users who are obligated to install these updates to stay ahead of endless security gaps in the OS.</p>
<p>Part of what I find irritating about MS in all this, is that SP3 doesn&#39;t really seem particularly necessary . . . from what I hear, it is a mere tidy-up SP that pulls together incremental patches that had already been released previously.</p>
<p>Also, ASUS is a major Mobo manufacturer, and the problem MoBo was a popular model. If MS didn&#39;t know that, they *should* have, and if they don&#39;t care about introducing incompatibilities with such a population of users, then that says something about MS&#39;s attitude towards us.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say that ASUS is off the hook either. THEIR attitude is inexcusable, and I wish I had the ability to get the,m to experience business consequences for their response in this case. But I am only one person, whom they easily ignore.</p>
<p>My bottom line remains that both MS and ASUS should be working to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#39;d be happy to share with you the bounce-back notices from MS that show how they failed to provide me with valid email contact info. You may not have shared my experience, but I can prove that what I experienced was true.</p>

		                <p>Oh my goodness. &nbsp;This is probably the best post/website I have ever came across for help. &nbsp;Running the Asus mobo mentioned above, and for the life of me couldn&#39;t figure out what the issue was. &nbsp;I was able to narrow it down to WIN XP SP3 patch after reinstalling windows 3 times, and searched for clues when I finally came across this website.</p>
<p>The thumbdrive/external hard drive allows me to boot up now. &nbsp;I can also boot up if I unplug the mouse, however, the mouse won&#39;t work in the PS/2 port with an adapter. &nbsp;Not sure why on that part.</p>
<p>It amazes me how someone figure this out. &nbsp;I mean really, who would think to plug in a storage device through your USB to solve this issue. &nbsp;Great site, great help.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas on getting my PS/2 port to work with the mouse I can then get rid of keeping the thumb drive. &nbsp;Ill be checking this page constantly. &nbsp;Again thanks for this page, you are a life saver.</p>

<p>I am one of those with an ASUS A8N32 SLI Deluxe mobo. &nbsp;I had the system running fine until applying SP3. &nbsp;Then the BSOD with the APIC Bios message.</p>
<p>Several attempts at recovery later I opt for a clean reformat/install (after all it&#39;s been running for 2 years...) off a WinXP SP2C disk. &nbsp;Everything ran beautifully after applying the appropriate drivers.</p>
<p>Then thinking it was a fluke before - I applied SP3 again. &nbsp;I am reassuring myself that it was for the sake of repeatability....</p>
<p>So yes I got the BSOD again. &nbsp;Then I got &quot;smart&quot; and looked for the recovery directions to roll back SP3 from recovery console. &nbsp;This due to not being able to do any boot mode at all without BSOD rebooting.</p>
<p>Link: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950249">support.microsoft.com/.../950249</a></p>
<p>Method 4 is what has to be used. &nbsp;This got me past my BSOD, but had a problem with hanging at mup.sys in any mode. &nbsp;Despite recovering mup.sys from the Win CD but to no avail. &nbsp;So am now doing what I should have done - reformatting and reinstalling and can continue working on my laptop.</p>
<p>FYI as a couple of sidenotes - I have SP3 running on an ASUS M2N32 SLI Deluxe Wireless edition just fine</p>

<p>Also for those that &quot;privatize&quot; their docs directory or any directory for that matter and need to recover files before reformatting but can&#39;t get to it? &nbsp;I slaved the drive via some hw I have into a USB slot (in this case on the M2N machine). &nbsp;Ran Acronis True Image Home version to &quot;back up&quot; that particular directory that I couldn&#39;t get into. &nbsp;This worked fine and allows me to access all my files in that directory on the backup image.</p>

		                <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a dell dimensions 8200 spc ran while AVG was scanning. &nbsp;I got an error and it looked like SP3 was being deleted. &nbsp;It still asked me to restart so I did. &nbsp;PROBLEMS!!! On reboot it hangs up at the windows xp screen which is almost unreadable due to blue vertical lines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did uninstall and reinstall a new driver adapter last week. unrelated? &nbsp;I have no idea. </p>
<p>I also have VPN software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can restart in safe mode. WHAT DO I DO?</p>

<p>There is not a restore point available. &nbsp;SP3 is not listed as a program, so the self unistall it did was accurate. &nbsp;I believe it still is the cause of the failure to boot properly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few attempts, it would not even boot in safe mode. &nbsp;Removed usb (external hard drive and thumb drive) and could boot in safe mode again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just at a loss for what to do. </p>

		                <p>Laurie, step 1: back up everything. Now! :-)</p>
<p>Seriously. Start with that. You can copy all your data to a USB flash drive from safe mode. After that your options are to either reformat and reinstall, or to try to install the service pack again in safe mode. I would recommend the former.</p>
<p>It may be something as simple as a faulty video driver, which would explain the symptoms you are seeing. Unless you know what you are doing, however, it could be tricky to fix. You can go into Computer Management and uninstall the graphics driver and then try booting it normally. However, I would recommend you have someone walk you through that unless you know what you are doing. Call Microsoft&#39;s free technical support listed above for SP3 issues. They may be able to walk you through it.</p>

		                <p>Jesper, I&#39;ve just waded through all of the posts, hoping I&#39;d find a way around the reboot problem. I&#39;m trying to help a friend, here. I knew better than download and install SP3, but he didn&#39;t, and Windows Updates were configured to &quot;Automatic.&quot;</p>
<p>So, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got in front of me:</p>
<p>1) An HP a1640n that won&#39;t boot into safe mode, the recovery console, or even with a BartPE or Hiren&#39;s CD. The pc has an Intel Duo Core E6300 1.86Ghz processor with 1066FSB, 2GB of RAM, the Asus P5BW-LA mobo, and Media Center 2005 (Milliennium Edition) Rollup 2, with SP2 installed. </p>
<p>2) I tried following the instructions you offered, but without being able to get beyond the stop errors and the constant reboots, I haven&#39;t had any success at all. the stop codes vary, based on what I attempt, but the most recent one is 0x0000007B (0xF78D2524, 0X00000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000). I have also seen 0x0000007B errors, 0x0000007E errors, and even 0x000000ED errors.</p>
<p>3) I have disabled everything I can in the BIOS, but HP doesn&#39;t allow disabling of caching and shadowing in this pc.</p>
<p>Microsoft and HP are pitching the ball back and forth, but so far, nobody&#39;s hitting home runs. </p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions? I&#39;d really appreciate hearing them. My friend is a lawyer, not a techie guy at all, and I&#39;m his best hope for fixing this without having to ditch the hard drive.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Marsha</p>

<p>I did the sp3 update and when i was done logitech popped up and said it had an update. I installed the update and promptly restarted then it hung when the logitech bluetooth screen came up for the new update. After 10 restarts i started in safe mode, deleted the logitech program and now it works great, unfortunatly I cant program the keys and buttons which is why I bought the mx 5500 any suggestions?</p>

		                <p>Just discovered this blog, great!!!</p>
<p>I am currently in a panic that I&#39;ve lost my important files forever (they weren&#39;t backed up)</p>
<p>Last night I installed SP3 which came through Windows &quot;automatic updates&quot;; now I seem to be having a similar problem to many others - computer will not start up again. When I select to boot in safe mode, it can&#39;t do this &amp; just reboots again. I am able to access Recovery Console but am unfamiliar with the commands for this or what to do next. I have looked everywhere but can&#39;t find my Windows XP disk.</p>
<p>I have a Compaq PC and think the processor is AMD Athlon...</p>
<p>Should I run the &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot;? Am I right in saying the worst that can happen is that this doesn&#39;t resolve my problem and I have no chance of losing my files/causing further damage, if intelppm isn&#39;t the cause? Also, do I just type &quot;sc config intelppm start= disabled&quot; exactly into recovery console? Thanks hope you can help, i&#39;m so scared of losing everything</p>

		                <p>I was avoiding SP3, I thought. But somehow I approved the Windows updates without noticing that SP3 was included. Rebooted and went to bed. Next day, windows won&#39;t boot (AMD HP oem XPPro pc). I didn&#39;t realize SP3 was installed, so I thought a hard boot the day before had corrupted my Windows. I keep backups since I work online, but had some recent work that wasn&#39;t backed up and was behind deadline for some new work, so I was unamused to have to reinstall windows. I reformatted the partition and reinstalled Windows twice to no avail. Finally, my husband found this blog and showed it to me. I followed your instructions just in case, and the problem was solved. &nbsp;Even though I lost files and a day&#39;s work thanks to HP and Micro, who knows how much work time I would have lost without you! Thank You! </p>

		                <p>I&#39;ve updated 2 of my 3 machines to SP3 so far. My first install, a custom-build AMD dual core, went flawlessly.</p>
<p>My second install, on a company-owned AMD computer exhibited one small problem, where it would begin to boot up, and then display the Windows XP logo with the Star Trek-type animation, and just sit there, without disk activity or anything else.</p>
<p>I restarted in Safe Mode, checked the device manager, saw no problems, and rebooted in regular mode (since then several times) without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
<p>One of these days I&#39;m going to risk that thrid machine.</p>

<p>Installed SP3 on my system only to have it fail to reboot, or even go into safe mode. Was thinking it was format time after searching for quite awhile with no solution to my particular problem... when I found this blog.</p>
<p>Normally I dont take the time to reply to blogs I will this time.. because you asked nicely :) .</p>
<p>The usb flash drive inserted PRIOR to turning on my computer worked. I am back into my system and very happy. I will have to read through ALL of the posts to see if an exact cause was found and a workaround so that I do not need the flashdrive at startup.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say MS is not to blame at all. They are partially to blame [as you mentioned] if something worked and then doesn&#39;t with SP3 - unless what they did corrects an issue and the manufacturer has time to test their products.</p>
<p>I wonder if ASUS even bothered to check if *ANY* of their products [not just mobos] have issues with SP3. MS did supply betas and RCs of SP3. I know of a few who have tested their products with the betas and RCs and finally the release.</p>
<p>Why did MS do this? Well, it&#39;s been their policy [although they have broken that more than once] that when a SP is released, the previous SPs have up to 2 years of life left.</p>
<p>Most people don&#39;t really have to go to SP3 [especially if they skip Vista and go to &quot;Windows 7&quot; after that comes out.</p>
<p>By the time SP2 support dies, XP will be in extended support - which means just security updates [with minor exceptions]. Because SP2 won&#39;t be supported, the updates down loaded will be smaller [depending on the update, no separate files for each SP].</p>
<p>Remember also that if you decided to install SP3 in a year from now, you&#39;d have to reinstall just about every update since SP3 aside from SP3.</p>
<p>Granted, it&#39;s great for companies that may still need to install SP3.</p>
<p>Also note that SP3 contained not just security updates but various other fixes that were released since SP2 came out and even some that weren&#39;t released plus 2-3 enhancements [mostly for enterprises].</p>

		                <p>Wade: I had a similar issue where my Logitech keyboard &amp; mouse combo software wasn&#39;t working. Device Manager reported just HID compatible device instead of saying Logitech Keyboard [etc.]. Contact Logitech&#39;s support. They gave me a nasty thing to do. At the time I though it may or may not be related to SP3 with SetPoint 4.6 [see my note way above on this page].</p>
<p>Jay: I hope you disabled the PPM on an AMD system and not Intel!</p>
<p>Derek Gabriel:</p>
<p>Check the BOOT.INI and see if it somehow got reduced there. Also check Intel&#39;s site for an update to the processor drivers. MS site may also have them.</p>

		                <p>I found this blog, ,thankfully, before I did any damage, and the USB storgage device fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Hardware: &nbsp;ASUS A8N32SLI with AMD processor.</p>
<p>Update: &nbsp;SP3</p>
<p>Symptom, could not reboot, even in safe mode. &nbsp;Got prompt with choices but when windows started it&#39;s first screen, it blinked off after about 1 or 2 second and started over at BIOS level with a new reboot.</p>
<p>Solution: &nbsp;Inserted a USB flash memory card in a slot.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t believe that anyone figured this out, nor that I found it so quickly - I was about to rebuild my system. &nbsp;</p>

		                <p>So, XP randomly decided to download service pack 3 while I was away from my keyboard, and not knowing, I rebooted my PC sometime later and now I&#39;m stuck in a rebooting loop. I&#39;m posting this from safe mode. </p>
<p>The only reason why I got safe mode to work was because I got into the boot bios or whatever by pressing F8 before windows loaded and took &quot;autorestart after crash&quot; or whatever. But again, if I restart, it puts me in the loop, and won&#39;t let me in my normal PC.</p>
<p>SO. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done:</p>
<p>I put in my xp cd and ran the repair thing, and it didn&#39;t do ***. I ran 3 different scans and it can&#39;t find anything wrong. I&#39;ve read this really helpful blog about this problem, but a lot of the fixes don&#39;t apply to my pc since I built it myself. Like, it says to go to regedit, then go to a certain folder and change a certain file&#39;s value, but I don&#39;t have it. at all. Instead of intelppm, I seem to only have intelide, which is something totally unrelated.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve restarted my PC without any USB connections, and I&#39;ve totally uninstalled SP3.</p>
<p>It&#39;s 2:20 am and I am mentally exhausted at this point, I&#39;ve been working on this for about 12 hours now. So if there is anything any of you can come up with, I would really appreciate it. </p>
<p>Oh, I&#39;m running my PC on a AMD Athlon 64 4000+</p>

		                <p>Matt M: Check the Dell site for updated drivers. In the tread above [and it may apply to yours] some wireless cards with a certain chip hail with SP3. In a general rule, make sure your system drivers are current before a SP upgrade.</p>
<p>MichaelN &amp; Others: If you don&#39;t want SP3, add the following in your registry:</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate]</p>
<p>&quot;DoNotAllowSP&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p>This came from the Windows Service Pack Blocker kit from Microsoft. For the next 6-8 months it will block SP3 from installing.</p>
<p>Alternative would be to stop Automatic Updates completely and manually do them yourself after every patch Tuesday [note that it may list SP3, make sure you don&#39;t choose it].</p>
<p>Note that SP2 will stop being supported in early 2010. So by then you either accept it or switch to Vista/Windows 7. As well, when you finally end up installing SP3, you will need to install virtually every security update since SP3 came out.</p>

		                <p>Hi Jesper,</p>
<p>You are doing great work. &nbsp;My problem seems like a variant of the SP3/HP/AMD issue. &nbsp; machine is a hp pavillion ze1230 laptop AMD Athlon XP 1.3G. &nbsp;the 3 issues are: 1. &nbsp;all Firefox bookmarks were deleted, 2. laptop fails to boot on 1st try, but is always successful on 2nd try. &nbsp;3. &nbsp;laptop will freeze with no warning - typically after 30-60 min. &nbsp;mouse doesn&#39;t move, etc. &nbsp;must hit power button to reboot. &nbsp;I am not having repeated reboot issue. &nbsp;I did do a System Restore to a date prior to the SP3 update which I think helped the freezing problem a little, but honestly can&#39;t remember. &nbsp;thanks in advance for your help.</p>

Usually I just allow an express install and I do not look at the download. &nbsp;I have just trusted Microsoft. &nbsp;Last week I happened to look at the download before installing it. &nbsp;When it read &quot;Service Pack 3&quot;, I remembered all the hub-bub about Service Pack 2 but figured I would have heard about it on the news if it was a problem, so I just allowed an install. &nbsp;The next time I opened up the drive I got the &#39;blue screen of death&#39; and the computer tried to reboot but would not and it tried instead to run checkdisk. &nbsp;Instead of checkdisk running it flashed a blue screen reporting that my MFT file was corrupted. &nbsp;I then opened up my second hard drive, which is my backup, and had also just loaded service pack 3. Checkdsk ran and immediately started deleting corrupt files. I placed the hard disks in another computer as slaves and it turns out that it deleted 140 gig of data on one ant the other cant be read without the MTF file. </p>
<p>Apparently service pack 3 has problems with AMD processors and according to one Microsoft tech some adobe products. Both of which I used with the drives. I&#39;m working on it with a microsoft tech (research team) but it looks like some substantial portion of my data (close to all of it) will be unrecoverable. None of the standard fixes have seemed to help. Recovery console can not read any directory. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help me??? </p>

		                <p>Allright. AMD-PC. Installed xp sp3 via automatic updates. However, being aware of virusscanners being able to disturb this update, I disabled that. After the update the system does not boot anymore. I get nothing on the screen. There are some sounds on the motherboard (about 8 times... sounds like on-off) and then the cmos-biep comes around. Keyboard reacts, the cd-rom-player reacts, but nothing happens. The system restarts after that procedure and I can&#39;t do nothing at all.</p>
<p>So. No way I can do a system restore, no way I can get into the registry. How is this to be solved ??</p>
<p>Hope you also have an answer to this Jesper. Thanks in advance !</p>

		                <p>Sorry to have another message. I do want to solve the issue here. I now connected the hdd, from this system which was affected by SP3, via usb to another computer. At first I could not access the main windows partition (ntfs), so had to do a chkdsk. Probably wrong, but I fealt I had no options. Wow, he was doing a lot, I opted /F/V/X and so, thus he found a lot of issues.</p>
<p>Now I can access the partition which contains the windows environment. Is there a way I can solve it here, meaning... can I copy systemfiles from my computer&#39;s hdd to the affected hdd so it will boot up again and maybe (hopefully) work normally ? Or isn&#39;t that possible at all. What can be done. My previous message doe not show up yet, so I guess you are busy. Hope you can help me soon enough, cause people need this pc back in order to be able to use it again.</p>
<p>Somewhat I feel it is not right to have consumers having to deal with these problems due to maybe a wrong SP3 pack or mistakes from systemproviders. Blaming each other does not help to prevent people to have these problems.</p>
<p>That said, hope you can help me out here. Thanks!</p>

		                <p>Thank you for fixing my computer with your detailed instructions after an upgrade to SP3 on an HP AMD machine. Apparently I am part of the second wave of XP users getting an automatic update to SP3. I recommend clarifying that there is a space between &quot;=&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; in the Safe Mode correction method since it doesn&#39;t work without the space. </p>
<p>This problem is rediculous! And to not resolve this issue automatically since May, thats insane! Some people don&#39;t have second computers ready to get on the net to look for a repair ASSUMING they are capable and aware that they can do that. All I can say now is that I AM FUMING!!</p>
<p>THANKs again!</p>

		                <p>Firstly, I&#39;m using an Intel processor, not an AMD. I have Norton Internet Security and Systemworks. </p>
<p>SP3 appeared to install correctly and I have no problems once my pc has booted. However, it is taking, on average, 15 minutes to boot.</p>
<p>I carried out a defrag to see if this was the cause of the slow boot but to no avail so I uninstalled SP3 and this returned boot times to normal. However, I now cannot run defrag; I get the following error message: MMC cannot open the file c:\windows\system32\dfrg.msc</p>
<p>The file has not been deleted.</p>
<p>I have a sneeky feeling I need to reinstall SP3 in order for defrag to work but, for obvious reasons, am reluctant to do so. Any help would be greatly appreciated, either to get defrag up and running again or, more to the point, to get SP3 working properly.</p>

<p>Since installing SP3, my pc takes on average 15 mins to boot. I tried running disk defrag to see if that would help. It didn&#39;t so, having failed to find any help, I uninstalled SP3.</p>

		                <p>My desktop computer HP Vectra XE320 with Windows XP Professional is on automatic update. I got an update SP3 that I was asked to install. I downloaded and installed. It went through the entire process without any problem and even created restore points. It then asked me to restart the computer for the updates to take effect. I did this but this is where the problem occurred.</p>
<p>It went through the normal re-boot but as the Windows XP banner showed, it then came to a halt showing a blue with things written but only for a split second then goes back to re-booting.</p>
<p>A screen comes up to go on Safe, Safe with networking, Safe with command prompt, Last Known Good configuration or Start Windows Normally.</p>
<p>I have chosen every option there is but it loops again to the same thing.</p>
<p>I am unable to come to the Windows XP log on screen for all users of the computer. </p>
<p>I tried disabling the automatic restart when system failure and was able to see the error message. It is 0x00000050.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find my original windows XP Professional CD.</p>
<p>I had an Instant chat with HP and after explaining, I was asked to call up HP service center to get the CD. I am being asked to reinstall Windows XP but the instructions given to me does not at all refer to solving the problem but talks about a clean install or upgrading to Windows XP.</p>
<p>Please help as it gets confusing now.</p>
<p>I am using my laptop to do this.</p>

		                <p>My HP a1310n (AMD 64) is stuck at the HP Invent screen. I unplugged all my USB devices and tried booting with a PS2 keyboard and my monitor attached only. I am able to quickly press one of the options on the Invent blue screen before the PS2 KB becomes inoperative and the PC sits there with the &quot;loading...&quot; message for hours. &nbsp;I have the 200 GB SATA drive and a DVD/RW attached inside. That&#39;s it. I have reseated all the cards, memory, and devices, even plugged in a flash drive hoping for a boot and there is nothing. I cannot boot from CD and there is no floppy to use a boot disk with. </p>
<p>I even swapped out two IDE drives today and got the same result of being stuck at the HP screen. &nbsp;I had read up on the problems associated with SP3, so I did not upgrade from SP2 for that reason. </p>
<p>My PC was locking up during online games, and after one night this weekend, it decided to stop booting altogether. &nbsp;I have searched this blog for info on my situation and have not found anything yet sufficient to fix my problem.</p>

<p>Ok so I got the auto-update for SP3 and went ahead and installed it. When I boot up after install - I get post the XP logo screen and to the point where windows should load. I get a balck screen - but the mouse works (IE pointer moves up and down) but nothing futher</p>
<p>I reboot into safe mode and experience very much the same - Get Mouse pointer that moves - and all 4 corners confirm its in safe mode. What does concern me is that it thinks its in SP2 - even though SP3 should be installed.</p>

<p>Does your mouse and KBoard work?</p>
<p>Given we have 5 computers at home - this would not be an issue for me. I would follow once of the following</p>
<p>1) Most M-Boards have a on board ethernet adapter - so enable and run a wire to your router. Most will have a port in the back for a connection.</p>
<p>2) Speak nicely to a friend to cut it onto a (would way USB flash drive but we all know what will happen) - cut onto a disk and try from there</p>
<p>I will try and reboot with nothing plugged in and see how it goes.</p>

		                <p>Borg,</p>
<p>My mouse and keyboard works. They are not USB connected but through the old PS2 connection. As soon as I am on windows, I can do everything and if I restart it is okay. But, no USB devices.</p>
<p>Which is my problem because I cannot connect to the internet. MY idea now is to download through my laptop the latest USB drivers/installation software from my broadband service provider, place it on CD and use this to load the drivers to my PC. will see then if my usb broadband connection will work. Once I am on the internet, I will go to HP and download the drivers for my HP scanner, then do the same thing for the rest of my usb devices.</p>
<p>I am going to do the remove SP3 as a last resort. And, of course, before doing this, I have backuped all my files that I don&#39;t want to lose if after all of these, I get a hard drive crash.</p>
<p>Good luck to me and all of us ;-))</p>

		                <p>I had this happen at work on a PC with an Intel Quad processor. The computer does have two quad output ATI video cards plus a dual output with a total of 10 22&quot; running monitors for a city GPS tracker system. SP3 seams to have caused the video drivers to fail after reboot. To stop the boot loop I had to uninstall the SP3. Once I did this all the drivers for the video cards needed to be reinstalled and the ridiculous configuration for a monitor setup this complex had to be set back up from scratch. IÕm not going to attempt to install SP3 again, forget it! I would however like to have a more technical explanation of why it causes the video to fail to give to my supervisors. Is there any other information on my scenario? Most of all the information I have found so fare has come from this site! Thanks for all youÕre help!</p>

		                <p>If you have an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard try disabling APM in the BIOS setup first. If that doesn&#39;t work, try resetting the BIOS settings to default (just remember to save or record all of your previous settings).</p>
<p>I tried a number of different solutions and this is the only one that worked (though I was able to boot with a USB key). I tried installing 4 different slipstreamed SP3 windows versions then attempted to update to sp3 manually 3 different times, trying different fixes before and after each installation but got the rebooting at windows splash screen problem every time. I also tried changing virtually every BIOS setting and then updated to 1405 but nothing worked. (Actually, I was able to boot after the BIOS update but this was probably because the default settings were restored with APM disabled).</p>
<p>Although this may just be a specific case, I&#39;m pretty sure most of the A8N32-SLI issues with SP3 are related to ACPI and APM management.</p>
<p>Btw, turning off APM turned out not to be such a big deal- for some reason I can still resume out of standby with the keyboard- maybe a bug in the bios?</p>
<p>Anyway, SP3 seems to be working fine for now (no constant rebooting). Thanks Jesper and everyone else for posting such helpful info!</p>
<p>I&#39;m running 3800+ X2 (@ 2.5ghz, @ about 1.45V vcore) on A8N32-SLI deluxe, 1405 bios, USB mouse, PS/2 keyboard, win xp pro SP3...</p>

		                <p>I appear to have the motherboard in question. Before finding this blog I was able to boot into safe mode with command prompt (the other safe modes didn&#39;t work.)</p>
<p>I attempted a system restore to a point before SP3, and it crashed about halfway through. After that I was unable to boot up in safe mode, and I left for work.</p>
<p>Now, with this information in hand, and thinking that the motherboard sounded familiar, I tried booting up with my mouse unplugged. I got a different login screen than usual, but Windows loaded. Then I got a message that MSIMG32.dll is not a valid Windows image. This message repeated with a variety of programs giving the error. The error currently on my screen is titled CCUpdate.exe - Bad Image.</p>
<p>Is this related to my failed System Restore? Is there a chance that a new System Restore with my mouse unplugged will fix this? Do we have any new information on a better solution than leaving a flash drive stuck in a USB port, or buying a PS/2 adaptor for my mouse?</p>
<p>It feels more than a little wrong to me to have to buy a dumb little adaptor or a permanent fixture flash drive because SP3 won&#39;t play nice with my motherboard and a USB mouse plugged in. (I also like to keep my mouse plugged in through a USB port in my keyboard, so I&#39;d prefer not to change it to PS/2 if possible, but mostly it&#39;s really the principle of the thing. Workarounds are great, and I&#39;m thankful you&#39;ve found one, but I would love a fix.)</p>
<p>If there&#39;s any further information I can provide to help track down a solution, let me know.</p>

		                <p>I&#39;ve been running a large college network for years. I build PCs. I program in many different languages. I write commercial applications. YET.... I have been defeated by this damn service pack. The dual-core pentium I built for my daughter loaded it with no ill effects at all. I knew there may be problems with my own older business PC (which I based on an ASUS A8V and AMD 3500+) so I carefully prepared the way, making all the necessary adjustments, making sure all my drivers were right. After the install, on re-boot, the screen went black and remained that way. Hours of waiting and restarting ensued. Starting in Safe Mode worked but, try as I might, I could not identify what was going wrong. One thing for sure was that my ATI graphics drivers weren&#39;t working. After 6 hours more of experimentation and frustration, I decided to uninstall the service pack using the microsoft recommended method. Guess what? Exactly the same black screen problem. I even tried system restore but to no avail. So I gave up the ghost - I replaced the hard drive with a clone I&#39;d made just in case of problems. Now alls right with the world as I plod along with SP2 and automatic windows update bolted in the Off position!</p>

		                <p>Hey, I got ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard and AMD processor and Im having this reboot problem.</p>
<p>I was reading this site and I saw someone writing that removing my usb mouse, and adding in mouse with &quot;old plug, ps2?&quot; will get me to windows, well that did and Im absolutely happy about it, but since I have to do that mouse thing every time I want to start my computer I started to wonder if there is any chance at all to fix this issue for good?</p>
<p>Maybe there is a fix in this site but I just cant find it, Im not that great with computers and my english isnt perfect either so I would need some rather simple expalantion, if possible.</p>

		                <p>I was able to boot up by removing all usb devices. This allowed me to use the PC with SP3. However, I could not get an internet connection as I did not have the usb broadband on. When i tried to connect the modem to the usb port, the system would fail and the PC restarts. I checked the error message and found that the original error message 0x00000050 was now the HP AMD SP3 error message 0x0000007e.</p>
<p>I then felt that it was getting too complicated so I decided to remove SP3. I was able to do this via Control Panel Add/Remove programs.</p>
<p>The removal of SP3 and reinstalling of SP2 took a long time and the restart was so slow. I almost decided to terminate but, on second thought, just waited for the PC to complete it job. It finally came back on with SP2. If this happens to you when you decide to remove SP3, just allow the PC to complete its job even if you find it slow.</p>
<p>Am back and happy with SP2.</p>
<p>I have a friend who said he had no problem updating to SP3 at the time I was having trouble with it. Just now, he advises that his PC is having problems now and would want to remove SP3 when he comes from work tonight.</p>

Security hot fix support [as well as other support] will die for Win XP SP2 in about 16 months. Or go to Vista or &quot;Windows 7&quot;.</p>
<p>Wolfcall2: Stuck at agp440.sys? Good sign it&#39;s your video drivers [either that or whatever loads after].</p>

		                <p>I had this problem too. Reinstalled windows for third time &amp; managed to get round it. Safe mode won&#39;t work, so reboot with XP disk in &amp; go to recovery console. I did two things, but it seemed to work - more trila &amp; error than knowledge:</p>
<p>Firstly, at the prompt I typed &quot;BOOTCFG /REBUILD&quot; hit enter</p>
<p>It then asks for the windows to load. Since it previously only displayed mine as &quot;1. D\Windows&quot; I typed &quot;1&quot; hit enter.</p>
<p>Then it asked for OS Load Options. I hadn&#39;t a clue, so hit enter without typing anything.</p>
<p>Secondly, at the command prompt I typed &quot;FIXBOOT D:&quot; and hit enter.</p>
<p>This then asked me if I wanted to create a new boot sector for the windows installation. I typed &quot;Y&quot; and hit enter. It then asked me to name the new boot sector - I called mine &quot;1&quot;.</p>
<p>Then I rebooted without the XP cd in the drive. On reboot I had two options - to load the windows xp home edition or something called &quot;1&quot;.</p>
<p>I chose &quot;1&quot; and lo and behold my windows installation restarted perfectly - about 15 minutes ago - I&#39;m using it now.</p>
<p>I think that latter &#39;fix&#39; did the trick. I&#39;m not sure what, if anything, my previous dabblings did!</p>

		                <p>None of the above posts appear to apply to my set up. Having the same reboot loop problem with SP3 having loaded itself. (I have been through all posts!)</p>
<p>System is a Compaq Evo D310 Pentium 4 and am unable to access any safe mode (although safe option is selected and attempts to reboot). Stop message is a 0000007E and boot seems to stall at mup.sys</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>

		                <p>Hi, again; my problems with the endless reboot</p>
<p>continued even after I formatted C drive and re-</p>
<p>installed a pre-SP3 Acronis backup image. This</p>
<p>was very frustrating :(</p>
<p>However, by chance I came across the MS Hotfix</p>
<p>from the support site re:&quot;A blank desktop may</p>
<p>appear when you log on to a Windows XP-based</p>
<p>computer.&quot; Ran the Hotfix, expecting very little,</p>
<p>but it worked a treat. </p>
<p>I think there was also a System Restore to an earlier</p>
<p>point involved at some stage, but to be honest, I tried</p>
<p>so different things, so many times, I can&#39;t be sure</p>
<p>what exactly happened and when. but the endless</p>
<p>reboot has definitely stopped since the Hotfix:</p>
<p>windowsxp-kb936929-sp3-x86-enu.exe</p>
<p>Now, that things are back to &quot;normal&quot;, fingers</p>
<p>crossed, Windows Update has SP3 again in its hot</p>
<p>little hands, just waiting to go.</p>
<p>Should I or shouldn&#39;t I? I&#39;m still undecided. Would</p>
<p>a system restore point before the deed actually</p>
<p>work if I do want to back out again, d&#39;you think?</p>
<p>If worse comes to worst, there&#39;s always the image</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p> XP PRO cannot get in any way at all,only standard options are given none of them work have tried repair console it just sits like it cannot find another system previosly installed</p>
<p> My system worked fine for about 2 weeks before this happened,the only changes made were LOGITECH update for mx5000 blue tooth mouse and keyboard &amp; NVIDIA &nbsp;desktop update for system monitor &amp; oc adjustments still worked fine then just suddenly didn&#39;t,</p>
<p>XP PRO64 no problems at all </p>
<p> Can i fix this through the 64 bit side instead of a full re -install as all files seem to be accessible and still work if i open up C witch is xp pro even 32 bit processes that should not work on 64 bit side </p>
<p> And this tool that jesper has not being a real computer orientated person not sure what i should down load and when to use it </p>
<p> THANKS TO ALL your posts have given me a better idea but still unsure cheers.</p>

		                <p>after installing SP3 i had the boot problem and can not start my pc in any mode, not even the save one. I burned a BartPE disk and tried to use your tool after booting with BartPE. the problem is: i can not open your tool, only the editor is suggested to open it. I installed WIndows Script Host with help of another pc (my hard drive connected as slave). Still i cannot use it to open your tool. The error codes I got: 0x0000008E, 0xC0000005, 0x8057019E, 0xB6D09BA4, 0x00000000. I do have an AMD processor.</p>

		                <p>This is the reason why I have always bought Intel....</p>
<p>In the 11 years or so that I&#39;ve been working with Microsoft, they have always been the same. A controlled test ground is never the same as an open test ground, which is the general public. It sucks, but i&#39;m sure we all know that we are the final testers. Either adapt a system to ensure the least amount of problems, or buy a mac.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Microsoft put out a small article somewhere that listed guidelines to install Microsoft updates and service packs. (recognition of a shortfall?)</p>
<p>investigate all known issues first, perform a backup of data and system, registry and settings, install updates and service packs individually, fully test a system prior to proceeding to the next update and never update a live system until it can be rebooted.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, MS is still around, intel based PC&#39;s are still in the highest demand, and we all still rely on those people who, due to need, are smarter than MS in figuring out the issues.</p>
<p>The point? Think before you update and for those who don&#39;t, thank god for jesper.</p>

		                <p>Jesper, you are the greatest!</p>
<p>I have an AMD HP Pavilion a1130n and experienced the endless reboot problem after trying to install XP SP3. I didn&#39;t know about your solution at the time, so I did a system recovery. I later encountered the same problem while trying to download XP SP2 instead of SP3. I used my laptop to go online and search for other solutions, because I didn&#39;t want to do a system recovery again. Then I found your instructions.</p>
<p>Following your instructions was easy and took a lot less time than another system recovery would have. Thank you so much for the help!!</p>
<p>I agree with Kathy; there should be a warning about this with the update. If a warning had been there, I could have avoided this whole problem. Now I, too, have to reinstall a lot of programs due to the system recovery I originally resorted to. So much time and effort wasted! I wish I had known about your solution sooner.</p>
<p>Thanks again Jesper! =)</p>

		                <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found your blog while searching for solutions on my HP Desk Top that has an AMD processor and the same type problem--Reboots after a MS update--</p>
<p>The only difference is it has Vista Home Premium--</p>
<p>I have been thru all sorts of gyrations trying to fix this, to no avail--</p>
<p>I have worked with HP tech support and have had no luck--</p>
<p>I was about to give up and re install my factory image Vita all over again and try and download some of the new updates--</p>
<p>Would your solution maybe4 work on Vista?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

<p>Panic call from hubby @ 2pm. He had clicked on &quot;something that said &#39;install update&#39; and now nothing is working&quot; - finger poised over enter key after he had selected &quot;System Restore&quot; from the HP boot splash screen, but wanted to check with me first - &quot;Noooooo!&quot; I shouted - phone analysis with guy who has 2 left hands all thumbs when it comes to computers - established boot loop - managed to boot into safe mode - read out something from the screen that said &quot;XP SP3&quot; - (DANG) - then hubby got stuck because of thumbs and inability to recognise DOS prompt - told him not to touch ANYTHING until I&#39;m back home - got onto Google - found this site - lapped it all up - printed the pages - went home - typed two words into computer - rebooted without a glitch.</p>

		                <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>Like many here, I have an AMD processor and an A8N32-SLI Deluxe board and, unfortunately, also have the reset problem. </p>
<p>Hopefully this workaround will help someone.</p>
<p>When I try hitting the F8 button on my machine, I am not presented with the Windows Advanced Options menu (the one Jesper has featured in his advice). Instead I get a blue box, giving me a choice of &#39;Boot device&#39;, with my floppy drive, hard drive and cd drive listed. Selecting the hard drive and subsequently selecting the load windows normally option (if presented with the option) enables me to load up Windows normally, with my internal hard drive being available as normal. This is without having to use an external device to boot the PC normally. </p>
<p>The problem of course is that it is a bit annoying to have to do this every time you boot the PC. I imagine the only workaround may be to uninstall SP3 and follow Jesper&#39;s pre-install advice. </p>

I have not unplugged or attached anything, occasionally it will just stop in a DOS screen without any message, I have tried to start in Safe Mode but can not! also tried booting from original XP Home disk but it will not recognise it.</p>
<p>It will start after about 8 times being turn off &amp; on.</p>

		                <p>Without going into too much detail, it seems that the completely bizarre events I have been experiencing on my utterly reliable machine can also be traced to SP3. I now have a new Power Supply, CPU battery, and an extra 500+ RAM stick! Plus some really dazzling tales to tell about the problems I&#39;ve been having. I tried the memory stick boot, which has worked fine so far and have also now uninstaled SP3 - I am stll nervous that the semi-boot (which was the main issue) returning so I am preparing to start overclocking the CPU if it does. My error message reads that the system has booted in safe mode and that I should reset the CPU(?) Glad to let you know more about it if you think it would be helpful.</p>

		                <p>This is exactly what happened to me. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have access to anything when it happened and couldn&#39;t read these messages. I called HP/Compaq and paid $50.00 for tech support and $35.00 for the recovery disk, and still lost everything. FOUR YEARS of data. Now that I am up and running again, IT IS PROMPTING ME TO INSTALL THE SAME THING! LOL</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think so. Would love for that yellow icon prompt to disappear though. </p>

		                <p>hello, u stated that this doesnt happen with hp labtops, well, i have an hp labtop, pavilion zv6000 to be exact, and i have run into this problem, i&#39;ve tried disabling the intellppm driver and this did not work, it does start in safe mode, and before this the autochk problem occured but it still started up, so i thought it was temporary, but after another restart i wasnt so lucky, if u can help, please email me at ngforever1989@gmail.com, until then, im going to remove the service pack until this problem can be rendered, again, i am running a labtop with amd athlon processor, pavilion zv6000, although this install of xp pro isnt the factory install of windows, if that has any importance, help would be appreciated</p>

		                <p>Thank you, Thank You, Thank You. Your fix worked like a charm. I was able to uninstall SP3 with no problems, I then ran your fix and rebooted the computer. After reboot I installed SP3 and after install rebooted and the computer works fine. I used your fix on a HP Pavilion a1130n with an AMD 64 Athlon. Thanks again for this great tool. Dan</p>

		                <p>Jesper, do you know if you can install your tool in a slipstream of SP3? I am currently trying to slipstream WinXP Home for 2 computers I have - one is AMD(HP), and the other is an Intel-P4. If not, then the only other alternative would be to make 2 separate slipstream files and possibly removing the intelppm.sys file on the AMD version. BTW - great article and excellent feedback to people! - Ron</p>

		                <p>Yes It can</p>
<p>HP said the problem could occur because XP SP3 tries to place on computers a power management driver that&#39;s only supposed to run on PCs that use Intel chips. The driver can cause AMD-based computers to crash or enter a cycle of reboots, HP said.</p>
<p>Both HP and Microsoft are working on a patch for the problem. Until then, experienced PC users can work around the bug by starting AMD-based machines in Safe Mode and disabling the Intel power management driver. </p>
<p>1. Install Vista (Any of your choice as long as your PC is compatible with it)</p>
<p>2. Install Vista SP1</p>

		                <p>Ok here is my dealÉ</p>
<p>ECS motherboard w/ AMD processor had been avoiding SP3</p>
<p>Last night ran AVG virus check..got up in the morningÉsystem running led on tower shows full activity but nothing on the monitor and would not wake up. &nbsp;Reboot it and go the following message right away without being able to get past it.</p>
<p>BIOS ROM CHECKSUM ERROR</p>
<p>DETECTING FLOPPY DRIVE A MEDIA &nbsp;(I HAVE NO DRIVE A)</p>
<p>DRIVE A ERROR SYSTEM HAULT</p>
<p>So what I did was unplugged it and let it sit for a bit. &nbsp;Then was able to boot up. &nbsp;Upon boot up a ballon stated Ònew updates require restartingÓ &nbsp;(sp3)</p>
<p>Now 25% of the time when I shut it down it hangs at the very end.</p>
<p>If a try a restart it always hangs</p>
<p>Is this a result of SP3 or the fact AVG was running when it update</p>
<p>Is there a fix or will reformatting resolve this?</p>
<p>If so how do I avoid it again?</p>

		                <p>Problem: &nbsp;Would freeze every time at start up, but then would work the second start-up right after I forced a shut down. &nbsp;Looked at all my options; tried the flash drive thing (NO); tried the mouse into a PS2 slot (NO); then I found the intelppm.sys file, even though the widget above could not find it. &nbsp;Renamed the file xxxintelppm.syx and VOILA! &nbsp;My machine is fine. &nbsp;And that is what worked on my AMD motherboard.</p>

		                <p>A minor/optional suggestion before wiping your drive to reinstall:</p>
<p>Buy a new hard disk [they&#39;re cheap and big!] and a IDE and/or SATA [depenging on your old drive] to USB adapter or enclosure.</p>
<p>Pull out the old hard disk. Pop in the newer, bigger and possibly faster hard disk. Install Win XP. Attach old drive to adapter and enclosure and then to the system. Transfer old files to the new PC.</p>
<p>Bonus: Use the old disk [once files are off] as a backup disk.</p>

		                <p>I have an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe mobo...Windows automatic updates was enabled and SP3 (and other stuff I presume) came down while I was at work. My kids clicked &#39;restart&#39; when prompted to and the cyclic reboot began. Before doing anything I Googled and found this website - THANKS!!! </p>
<p>After putting a flash drive in a USB the machine booted into XP Pro straight away. I decided to try restarting to see if it would come up w/out the USB drive and noticed 9 more updates were queued to install that hadn&#39;t had the chance yet. I finished installing those updates and then restarted with the USB drive still in - XP booted up OK. I then restarted with the USB drive unplugged. Back to cyclic reboots...</p>
<p>I have an old 32MB USB drive I never use due to its small size, so I&#39;ll just plug it into the back of the PC and leave it there for now. I might even goto the Drive Manager and tell it not to recognize the drive with a letter...</p>
<p>Thanks again for the helpful site.</p>

		                <p>To fix the problem, boot into safe mode, or boot to a WinPE disk, or into the recovery console, and disable the intelppm.sys driver. You do not need it on an AMD-based computer anyway. To boot into Safe Mode, hit the F8 key as above, and select Safe Mode instead. You will need your Administrator account to log on in safe mode. To disable the driver, take the following steps: </p>
<p>If you booted into the recovery console, from a command prompt, run Òdisable intelppmÓ </p>
<p>If you booted into safe mode you can run Òsc config intelppm start= disabledÓ </p>
<p>If you booted into WinPE, you have to manually edit the registry. Do this: </p>
<p>Run regedit</p>
<p>Click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</p>
<p>From the File menu, select ÒLoad hiveÓ</p>
<p>Navigate to %systemdriver%\Windows\System32\Config on the dead system and select the file name System</p>
<p>Name it something you can remember, such as ÒhorkedÓ</p>
<p>Navigate to horked\ControlSet001\Services\IntelPPM</p>
<p>Double click the Start value and set it to 4</p>
<p>If you did what I did and completely destroyed things by running a disk check, navigate to ControlSet001\Control\SessionManager. Open the BootExecute value and clear out the autochk entries</p>
<p>Repeat steps 6-8 for the other control sets.</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>If this was your problem, the computer should now reboot just fine.Ó</p>
<p>There also seems to another problem involving this error message: </p>
<p>ÒProblem was detected and windows has been shut down to protect your computer from damage. </p>
<p>The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI compliantÓ </p>

		                <p>All: A little warning. If you reinstall your OS with the recovery CD or partition that came with your system, disable the IntelPPM [if you have an HP] before installing SP3. Install SP3 before anything else [with the probable exception of updated drivers].</p>
<p>Alternatively, find someone who has a SP3 integrated CD.</p>
<p>Ramsey: If you&#39;re talking about the IntelPPM issue, HP did release a fix for it. It&#39;s on their website somewhere. As stated before, you can&#39;t blame Microsoft for HP screwing up. [read the blog - HP used the same image for Intel CPUs for AMD CPUs - breaking Sysprep] If you&#39;re talking about the ASUS motherboard issue, that&#39;s ASUS&#39;s problem [IMuHO]. Why does one mobo not work and others do?</p>

I have replaced my USB mouse with pS2 still have the issue I tried the USB mouse with an external USB hard drive and the issue still persists. The bad thing is that my wife does photography and used another amd based machine to do her photo editing and that one too loops after the SP3 install and it is not the SLI board, infact that board is considerably older then the SLI.

		                <p>I&#39;ve read and tried nearly every solution applicable to my situation. Nothing has worked. I have an HP Pavillion Mediacenter A1350n. It includes an Athalon 64 X2 T 4200+ 2.2 GHz processor and and ATI Radeon Xpress 200 chipset. Motherboard manufacturer is Asus.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve followed these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Hit the F8 key during restart right when you see the black Windows XP screen come up. Then select the &quot;Disable automatic restart on system failure&quot; option&quot;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Boot into Safe Mode by hitting the F8 key as above, but select Safe Mode instead. (</p>
<p>3. Booted into the recovery console, from a command prompt, run &quot;disable intelppm&quot;. </p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;- I get a return message indicating that Intelppm.sys is already disabled.</p>
<p>4. I boot back into Safe Mode and I get a scree asking me &quot;which windows do I want to install?&quot; and given three choices:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;1) D: \i386</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;2) D:\miniNT</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;3) C:\Windows</p>
<p>I went into the Windows directory to search for intelppm.sys (to rename as stated). That file doesn&#39;t exist in the directory.</p>
<p>I&#39;m at a total loss here. </p>

		                <p>CS: We&#39;ll assume you looked in the \Windows folder before trying to use &quot;CD $....&quot; Full path should be c:\WINDOWS\$NtServicePackUninstall$\spuninst</p>
<p>All: Reminder that service pack 2 support dies in April 2009. After that date MS will release no security updates or regular updates [i.e. IE, WMP] that will support SP2. From then, if you are still using SP2, you will either have to jump to Vista/Windows7 or install SP3 [over SP2 or integrated] to continue to use Win XP.

		                <p>Well, glad I found this site as it explains somewhat what is happening. I have the AMD ASUS A8N-32 SLI Delux board listed in the 2nd problem. Exact same thing happening. I found out when I had my USB EVDO modem removed during a reboot. The modem has a small flash drive built into it. </p>
<p>I had contacted Microsoft Tech support and they had me remove SP3. They linked me to a site that provided an SP3 blocker tool to keep it from being installed again, but the link they gave didn&#39;t work. </p>
<p>For now it&#39;s not an issue for me, since I don&#39;t have much reason to not boot with the device plugged in. Just hope that Microsoft will provide a fix soon to prevent it.</p>

<p>Microsoft will not fix this problem as it&#39;s specific to one mobo model. ASUS should fix it - but don&#39;t count on it. I think they don&#39;t support it. My suggestion is to complain to ASUS.</p>

		                <p>I have tried to install Windows XP SP3 on two Intel based PCs. Both the installations did not succeed. On one PC the installation completed but the PC did not reboot on completion. I had to use the recovery procedure to backup to a previous working state. On the second, the installation appeared to start according to the progress bar but stopped after a few bars and did not continue. I stopped the installation. Both PCs still appear to be working OK at Windows XP SP2.</p>
<p>One of my PC&#39;s is an Intel P4 rather than AMD as a CPU. The motherboard is ASUS P4P800-E Deluxe with 4 GB RAM and 4 HDs for rendering speed. My software includes AVG free, ATI Catalyst 6.2, Adobe Video Collection 1.5 plus many other useful tools. These may relate to a possible malware and the Catalyst problem covered in the Blog and goodness knows what else.</p>

		                <p>JohnCPR: As I probably mentioned before, try a clean boot first. That&#39;s disable *ALL* applications and *ALL* non-Microsoft services with MSConfig. After rebooting the system after SP3 and everything has settled, go back into MSConfig and restore everything. This is probably one of the first steps MS tech support will tell you to do. I&#39;ve made a point in doing it on all systems.</p>
<p>Olorunosebi James: A big rule to remember - don&#39;t do any major surgery on a system when the system is required at a critical time [in your case, don&#39;t try until after the semester is over!].</p>
<p>Mario [and others]: Microsoft offers free support on installing SP3.</p>
<p>Have the c:\windows\svcpack.log file. Look at the bottom of the log for errors.</p>

<p>I repair computer for a living and ran into this on an HP a1203w with an AMD processor. &nbsp;By the time I found your article, I was toast. &nbsp;I had done a XPHome re-install with integrated SP3 and then got the STOP 0x0000007a. So I shrunk the Primary Active partition and installed another Windows to get at the original install. &nbsp;I used a boot CD with registery editors and took my best shot, but never could reach the noted registry entries. &nbsp;I like to think your description was my problem, but I will never really know. &nbsp;I did learn from your work to b more careful when troubleshooting PCs with AMD CPUs. &nbsp; THANKS.</p>

<p>I never saw the MiniNT option in the start menu after I did the recover re-install, but I I suspect you are at my position. &nbsp;I saw the MiniNT entry somewhere in my diagnostic tools and suspect that it is there because of my failed re-installation. &nbsp; Good luck - keep us posted if your&#39;re sucessful.</p>

<p>I disabled automatic restarts, and got this BSoD:</p>

<p>The Windows Logon Process system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000005 (0x00000000 0x00000000).</p>

		                <p>Quite frankly, I&#39;m not interested in install sp3, but the MS servers say I have to get it before providing any further updates.</p>
<p>I recently had to go through something similar with MS tech support because of that auto reboot in WinXP Pro after I first installed it. &nbsp;After all was said and done, we discovered that the video driver had to be an MS signed video driver, namely from Nvidia. &nbsp;Then XP could get into normal mode.</p>
<p>Since MS REQUIRES EVERYONE with XP Pro to install sp3 before any further updates, MS should make it hassle free without any of the evil.</p>
<p>I already defragment, check for errors, back it up. &nbsp;Bloody windows is supposed to be working for me - not the other way around.</p>

		                <p>HealingMindN: Unsure why you are saying that Microsoft requires SP3 on all systems before you can get security updates. It mentions this nowhere. Microsoft will support SP2 users into 2009 at least.</p>
<p>Last I checked every Nvidia driver is signed [and technically not by Microsoft] as well as from probably 99% of the drivers out there. Even if it wasn&#39;t signed, it will still allow you to continue with an unsigned driver.</p>

		                <p>I have an AMD based computer and the software tells me that I should be set to load SP3. However, when I install SP3 I get the reboot problem. I contacted a Microsoft representative in June, but he was unable to help. I tried again last night, hoping they might have fixed the problem. No such luck!</p>
<p>As someone else mentioned, it would be good to get updates but not possible until SP3 is installed.</p>

		                <p>clarkskee: If it shuts down at the opening screen where it lists CPU, memory, disks, etc the you have hardware issues. If it starts with the Windows XP screen and then shuts down you either have hardware issues or a problem with Win XP. One thought is that your power supply is failing or can&#39;t handle the load. In any case, this isn&#39;t the right place. Try a Microsoft forum.</p>
<p>Mandobrit: Are you actually trying to get your PC fixed? You mentioned that you&#39;ve had the problem since June. Now it&#39;s November. 6 months later and you have the same issue. Have you read this blog? Hint: IntelPPM? ASUS Mobo?</p>

		                <p>Ok, i really cant read all of this. I read the first post and none of the solutions suits me. If there is an solution somewhere on this tread plz let me now, ill read all :)</p>
<p>OK, here it goes.. </p>
<p>Well, i seem to have a 3th type of problem here so if any1 can help it would be appreciated... I have an AMD athlon 2200+ based desktop machine with sp2 installed on it, now(nforce2+radeon 9600pro+1GB DDR). While ago ive installed sp3 and got the endless reboot problem. My computer starts normaly but just when the bootup screen is about to show up, it doesnt. Actually, i got the same thing when i normally boot in safe mode, list of system files with path appears, than goes the normal logo bootup and reboot while booting. Did some research on net but found no solution. I can boot into safe mode and i found my computer is an &quot;Multiprocessor (something)&quot;, so i tought its not normal. I changed it to Standard PC and was able to start the Windows in normal mode. He loged on but restarted again after some time and thats the way it stayed. Tried with setting it to ACPI, but boot is interupted again with restart. &nbsp;The only thing i could do is to uninstall the damn thing. Still im quite qurious... </p>
<p>I also got problem installing the SP3 but solved it changing the reg entry &quot;Current version&quot; on value Checked...</p>
<p>thx</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t been able to resolve the issue because intelppm is nowhere to be found in my registry (though the file is in the &quot;drivers&quot; folder).</p>
<p>My computer won&#39;t even boot to safemode, so I used BartPE to access the registry. HP&#39;s suggested fix of renaming intelppm to XXXintelppm.syx did not result in success, either.</p>

		                <p>Well, in response to my own post, I fixed my problem. </p>
<p>With a windows XP install CD I installed the Recovery Console. Then I pretty much followed the instructions from &quot;Method 4: Use Recovery Console&quot; from Microsoft&#39;s instruction page for removing SP3: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950249/en-us">support.microsoft.com/.../en-us</a></p>
<p>After following their removal procedure, safemode became functional. From safemode, I did the registry tweak and then booted the system as normal. Then, from Add/Remove Programs, I took out the rest of SP3. Everything seems fine now!</p>

<p>Shaun: If not fixed by now, it won&#39;t be. It&#39;s an ASUS issue. I have one of their mobos but luckily not the A8N32Sli and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll buy ASUS again.</p>

Although the computer rebooted outlook express and internet explorerer were non functional ie could not activate yhem or any of the toolbars. I managed to reboot into safe mode and go to restore back to previous state. dont see need for sp3 so dont want the problems. im quite happy as it is. suggest dont be tempted if your current system is ok By the way it corrupted all my settings.never again</p>

		                <p>I have now installed XP SP3 on 20 computers, mostly in work groups. &nbsp;The computers were &nbsp;of various makes, models involving many different hardware configurations. &nbsp;Without Jesper&#39;s blog I would have been totally hosed. &nbsp;My grateful thanks go to him. &nbsp;My advice for what it is worth is to only attempt the install using a clean boot scenario. &nbsp;This greatly reduces the risk of severe problems. &nbsp;OK, it is 300 + MB download to get the stand alone install file, (unless you get it on a CD-ROM) but it is worth every bit of the time and effort. &nbsp;I had serious problems with 2 installs, which were not done using a clean boot but from Windows Update.</p>

		                <p>I have been attempting to install SP3 on my AMD pc desktop for 3 days, and I keep getting BSOD&#39;ed with all kinds of stop error msgs (from registry errors, to IRQL less equal.. whatever)! I don&#39;t know why I even bother, seeing that people who succesfully installed it are having all kinds of problems. I did, however, succesfully installed SP3 on my laptop (intel). </p>
<p>So now I&#39;m trying to &quot;uninstall&quot; SP3 from my desktop (it was downloaded succesfully and shows that it&#39;s ready to be installed). I went to add/remove programs and tried to uninstall it, but got BSOD&#39;ed ==&gt; 0x00000004 (0x00000001, 0xE2E1DAA8, 0x00080210). </p>
<p>It really isn&#39;t a big deal, but I want to get rid of it from the add/remove program. Any suggestions? Oh, and yeah, I know there&#39;s a link on how to remove the windows xp service pack 3, but not sure if it applies to me, since technically, it was never installed.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		                <p>Liss: most blue screens are associated with either flaky drivers or a problem with the hardware. Your hex code is incomplete and giving the complete IRQL helps. Registry errors? Doesn&#39;t sound good. I wouldn&#39;t even attempt to install SP3 until that&#39;s checked. As mentioned before, Microsoft offers free SP3 install support.</p>
<p>You should make sure your drivers [audio, video, network, chipset, etc.] are current and you have installed your system&#39;s latest BIOS.</p>

		                <p>Cheers pal, a very useful blog! I went for a complete reinstall to SP2 after installing SP3 when it was released, hoping that by now there would be a proper fix for the A8N32SLI. As there hasn&#39;t been I installed SP3 today and immediately experienced the reboot loop.</p>
<p>To fix it I set the following in the BIOS:</p>
<p>Serial, Parallel, Game and MIDI: Didn&#39;t matter</p>
<p>APM: Didn&#39;t matter</p>
<p>SATA RAID: Didn&#39;t matter</p>
<p>USB Legacy Support: Enabled</p>
<p>With a flash drive plugged in it worked fine but I decided to attach my USB mouse via a PS/2 adaptor.</p>
<p>Please note I had a USB drive attached during my first try back in May and couldn&#39;t find any combinations to get it booting properly.</p>
<p>Hope you fix this soon Asus!</p>

		                <p>sonchon: Googling the error would give you some easy results.</p>
<p>Do a clean boot before installing SP3.</p>
<p>The key [from what I&#39;ve seen] is to disable the Indexing service before installing. I&#39;d also do a chkdsk on your drive &nbsp;for good measure.</p>

		                <p>Plugging in a USB flash drive has enabled me to boot my PC. Not sure yet whether everything is working as it should be but deeply grateful for the info to get the damn thing running again. I will spend the rest of the evening sticking pins in my Bill Gates doll and wondering how a company such as MS could inflict such a half-baked update on customers! If you know of a way of avoiding having a flash drive attached using SP3, I would be keen to know about it. Even without it, You have much improved my Christmas! &nbsp;Many, many thanks. Geoff</p>

		                <p>I am one of the poor guys running the ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard. I wanna thank you for taking the time to post the info you&#39;ve gathered on your blog. It most likely saved me a lot of work.</p>
<p>I initially used the USB storage device method to get my computer to boot without the endless restart loop. I never had any BSOD. I did some research on the issue on the ASUS user forums and found users had been successful to resolve this permanently by disabling the Serial Port in the BIOS. After doing this, I no longer had to have the USB storage device attached. Weird, but it worked.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

		                <p>Finally as of the 26th of december ASUS launched a new BIOS rev. 1409 for the A8N32-SLI Deluxe. I installed it and with my fingers crossed installed SP3. No problems what-so-ever! And the 26th was even my irl birthday. Thank you ASUS for the present! :)</p>

		                <p>Yep, the A8N32-SLI deluxe was a fairly decent board when it came out, but man does the poor thing have, um, &quot;character&quot;. As if the nforce firewall not doing anything wasn&#39;t enough!</p>
<p>I just wanted to make an addendum to your trick of inserting a USB stick into the system to get it to boot: if you don&#39;t have a flash drive, just insert a bootable disk into your CD/DVD rom but don&#39;t hit the any key when it asks you if you&#39;d like to boot from that drive. I&#39;ve been having to do it since installing SP3 and it seems to work for me. I&#39;m using a USB mouse, too. So maybe it&#39;s some kind of hardware recognition traffic jam? Who knows, sadly this is all yester-year&#39;s tech now...</p>

		                <p>Yes, it looks like Asus finally did the right thing and released an updated Bios for the A8N32-SLI. &nbsp;It is version 1409 and can be downloaded here:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new">ftp.asus.com.tw/.../A8N32-SLI-Deluxe-1409.zip</a></p>
<p>I applied it last night and re-attempted to install SP3. &nbsp;Worked like a charm! &nbsp;It&#39;s refreshing to finally see a resolution to the incompatibility problem with this board. (rather than a band-aid solution like the usb drive fix)</p>

		                <p>I loaded SP3 on my XP Media Center yesterday. &nbsp;Its a home built HTPC using an ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe MB with an Athlon 64 x2 4800 CPU. &nbsp;I was doing updates and decided to chance SP3. &nbsp;Since I had bad experiences with my other (even Intel) systems updating to SP3 I decided to wipe and start a fresh load. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I loaded Win XP Media Center, then SP2, then SP3. &nbsp;After reboot I could not start XP just kept getting the F8 screen. &nbsp;After choosing the Disable automatic restart on system failure I got the blue screen you mention in your post &quot;Does your AMD-based computer boot after installing XP SP3? - Second Problem&quot; under Running Windows. &nbsp;As you mentioned - I tried a USB thumb drive and it worked. &nbsp;I can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t have a PS2 mouse to test but I am using a cables to go KVM that is USB on this and cannot test using a ps2 mouse yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The flash drive got me into XP in safe mode and normal modes and I&#39;m doing all the updates now. &nbsp;Interestingly I tried loading the pc three times before finally looking and finding your article from Google. &nbsp;The second time I loaded SP3 it rebooted ok and I did all the Microsoft updates and rebooted, then loaded the Audigy sound drivers and software. &nbsp;After that reboot it halted this time. &nbsp;Don&#39;t know why just mentioning it as thatÕs weird...</p>
<p>I thought to save a SysInfo.txt file if thatÕs of any value I can send it.</p>

		                <p>Stan: Language shouldn&#39;t make a difference (assuming you installed the French edition of SP3). I know there was an issue with Catalyst drivers. So installing the latest and greatest could help. [Actually, getting all drivers current won&#39;t hurt either.]</p>
<p>Some suggest disabling any AV before installing.</p>

		                <p>I have a Gigabyte motherboard with an AMD processor. &nbsp;I am running Win 2000 and wanted to change to XP so I loaded XP on a new SATA drive. &nbsp;XP crashed (XP SP1 &amp; SP3 crashed) crashed), &nbsp;I then loaded XP on an ATA drive with all of the drivers for the SATA and it runs perfectly. &nbsp;I then cloned the system to the SATA using Acronis and connected the drive as a USB drive. XP crashed and the MBA seemed destroyed. &nbsp;Every time it crashes I have to re-clone because there seems to be no working boot sector. &nbsp;I have disabled Intelppm whith no improvement. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t tried removing the mouse. &nbsp;Right now I am running XP Home SP3 on an old 20 Gig ATA hard drive. &nbsp;ONLY the SATA drive causes the crash, but even in an external box as a USB drive, so I don&#39;t believe it is a driver problem. &nbsp;Also I have no problem seeing either the SATA or the USB drive from the functioning XP system. &nbsp; If I find a fix I&#39;ll pass it on. &nbsp;One fix I don&#39;t like is to boot from the ATA and load all the software on the SATA drive.</p>

		                <p>Tom Benzie: You sure it&#39;s not an issue with the drive itself? Check with the manufacturer. My system would freeze with a SATA Seagate 7200.11 if at 3GB/sec but fine if I jumpered it to 1.5GB/sec. &nbsp;Yet my system took an older WD SATA2 3GB/sec drive.</p>
<p>Shana: You need a copy of the same CD that matches your copy of XP. If XP came with the system most likely OEM. If not with the system, then retail. Then you probably need the version - home or pro. If a friend has a copy of the correct edition, that&#39;s fine. [And legal.] I&#39;ll assume you Googled the c0000139 error. Some manufacturers [at least Dell] wasn&#39;t including the CD but did have a hidden partition that restored XP as if it was new. They also had a utility to build a CD from XP. Did you try a system restore prior to the fix?</p>

<p>I was reading your article, Help: I Got Hacked. Now What Do I Do?, and you stated that the only way to be sure that you have gotten rid is to reformat the hard drive. </p>
<p>Well, I keep getting these pop-ups with offers to load antivirus software. &nbsp;I started with the problem back in December and followed instructions I found at MajorGeeks (Read and Run Me First). &nbsp;It got rid of the problem but it is now back after about three weeks with a vengence.</p>
<p>I have little children that need to pc for school work, but some of the pop-ups are porno. </p>
<p>Could you tell me how to properly reformat the hard drive? &nbsp;Is there a link that can give me instructions?</p>
<p>I&#39;m no expert, but I have a lot of pc experience and DIY. &nbsp;So I feel very confident doing it.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>

		                <p>I just had to say thank you Jesper, I had avoided uploading service pk 3 until today because the last time I tried I ended up on the phone for several hours with a Microsoft Tech and ended up restoring my system and him telling me to never run service pk 3. &nbsp;But I came upon your blog followed your instructions and low and behold your my first &quot;to do&quot; after uploading service pk 3 and getting back on line! </p>
<p>I&#39;m not real computer illiterate and it was scary for me to try again but thanks to you I was successful, your on my hero&#39;s list now. Thank you again very much, Ruth Williams, Carson City, Nevada</p>

		                <p>I have all the same symptoms and error code (0X0000007E) and an AMD processor (not HP computer) and got the BSOD on install of SP2 (including the relooping boot which I was able easily stop). I&#39;ve read Johannsson&#39;s webpage, and many other articles HOWEVER, in the registry I am unable to locate the &quot;intelppm&quot; entry in either ControlSet001, ControlSet002, or CurrenControlSet. I did a full search of my hard drive from Windows for this file and came up empty that route as well. Entered the command prompt (sc config intelppm start=disabled) simply to see if it would work and I just wasn&#39;t finding the file. That failed too. I need to get SP2 installed for several of my other programs to work. Has anyone else experienced this (no intelppm file) or have any other ideas I can try. ALL the symptoms and error codes I have fit this problem to a tee yet I can&#39;t fix it. I&#39;m stuck in SP1!.... Any help would be greatly appreciated!! </p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>CJ</p>
<p>PS - the &quot;tool&quot; wouldn&#39;t work for me because I don&#39;t have XP SP2. &nbsp;:-(</p>

		                <p>Update --&gt; I was able to finally find the intelppm file in Windows under safe mode and renamed it (note: this was AFTER I installed SP2 where before I uninstalled SP2 and searched for the file) however, the other issues exist - no intelppm key in registry so the BSOD still exists. &nbsp;Back to square 1 again. &nbsp;All I have in the registry remotely resembling IntelPPM is IntelIDE but those are already set to value 4. &nbsp;</p>

		                <p>Hej, how many risks r in installing the tool and then SP3? I have an AMD-processor athlon 64 and a HP-computer. But i runn Jaws 7.10, a lizensed software for the visually handicapped. And i use the handy tech Braille wave brailledisplay and - for me in germany little complicated to gett, the swedish Voice Ingmar (Infovox Desktop 2.0). I wanted to install Songsmith, just to try it out. Now, this software doesn&#39;t work because i have no SP3. </p>
<p>Shall i better leave it all? I don&#39;t want to give upp reading bcker p Project Runebergs homepage and don&#39;t want to lose contact to all my swedish friends. Perhaps it&#39;s better not to try the tool and SP3 and then getting Songsmith... Or do you know a tool to install Songsmith without SP3? I have windows XP home, SP2, Jaws for windows 7.10 german and it was complicated ennough to get the swedish voice here in Germany. I am the only blind who runns a swedish voice, the jaws-supplier here in my region says.</p>
<p>Thanks fr helping me,</p>
<p>With best regards, med vnliga hlsningar,</p>

		                <p>I have the A8N32SLI board. In preparation for updating to SP3 (sometime in the near future) I flashed the new 1409 BIOS available on the ASUS website. I noticed one change by ASUS in this BIOS. In my previous version, 1303 BIOS, there was an entry &quot;Power Management/APM&quot; set to ENABLED at the top of the BIOS setup screen under POWER --&gt; APM Configuration. In the 1409 BIOS, this choice is gone. </p>
<p>Basically, this has no impact on my setup. But I thought others might find it interesting or relevant.</p>
<p>(BTW - the exact wording of the BIOS setup choices may be slightly different than specified above. I&#39;m working from hand-written crib notes I made of the BIOS settings in 1303 prior to the flash. The main point is, ASUS removed a variable from the BIOS setup as part of their fix.)</p>

		                <p>Hi. First off all, thanks for the blog and the helpfull information.</p>
<p>I have a intel based cpu, mother board DG965SS and processor C2D 2.13GHz, and nVidia 8800GT graphic card.</p>
<p>I had XP 32bits SP2 installed. After installing SP3 XP restarts by itself right after opening the desktop displayng some error windows, something like &quot;can&#39;t initialize dll&quot; at acstart.exe, notepad.exe, nwin.exe and one oure two more aplications. Restart again and keep looping.</p>
<p>I tried to start in VGA mode without success. Keep restarting. So i didn&#39;t try to uninstall nVidia drivers </p>
<p>Finally in safe mode i could start XP &quot;normally&quot;, and use a recovery point i created right before install SP3 to get back to SP2.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t figure out the solution, but is more information for people with Intel-based cpu. Right now my intention is to backup all my files format and reinstall XP already with SP3, </p>
<p>if somebody have more experiences about it, i&#39;d aprecciate.</p>
<p>thanks again to Jasper and everybody</p>

		                <p>@Fabrizio: Aside from making sure your drivers are current, you can try a clean boot. As well, Microsoft offers free SP3 support.</p>
<p>On the other hand if XP was installed way back when or you&#39;ve had other issues in the past [maybe got hit with malware, blue screens of death, etc.] it may be a good idea to do a fresh install. Just make sure you have the latest drivers handy after installing.</p>

		                <p>Great job Jesper, thanks!</p>
<p>I had a match of problem number two with an AMD processor and ASUS . Unfortunately the USB flash drive solution did not work at first. In fact the computer did not boot at all it got to the Splash screen for ASUS and I could not get into the BIOS nor could I even get the machine to boot from the XP CD. </p>
<p>The USB drive solution did not seem to work initially, but that seems to be b/d I was pluging into a USP hub, after removing the hub and Plugging directly into the USB port the machine booted. After this the sp3 installation ran to completion and my computer appears to be back to normal.</p>
<p>Based on my experience it would seem that the sp3 installation needs to complete after an initial reboot and somehow ends up in a faulty state on some AMD-ASUS boards. This is by passed using the USB flash drive trick and after the installation completes the flash drive is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Most of my post is copied from another pre-existing post with a few modifications</p>
<p>Many Thanx, I thought I was really hosed here... now back to the rest of my install.</p>

		                <p>OK, NO WAY!!</p>
<p>I used the tool; it said all clear. &nbsp;I uninstalled my video driver and some ATI TV card drivers and then for about the fourth time attempted to install the dreaded SP3.</p>
<p>It did the same as before; just got to the Windows XP splash screen and stayed there.</p>
<p>I went to safe mode and uninstalled it. &nbsp;Luckily it uninstalled okay. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a ABit AN7 motherboard with an AMD Athlon XP 3200+ CPU.</p>
<p>It just doesn&#39;t work on this machine!!</p>
<p>Any verified solution?</p>

(Reboot loop) &nbsp; Before trying the solution, there was no way I could get to Windows, all Safe Mode and Normal modes failed. I watched the log and it would crash at Windows/Drivers/fsbts.sys and reboot. First solution I tried different was I unplugged my wireless USB mouse (it has a PS/2 adapter I use) - Put in a regular 1gig kingston flash drive from walmart on the top USB port - It loaded slowly in safe mode, but it worked. I restored my computer back to before I installed service pack 3. I restarted my computer to see if it runs normally, and it&#39;s working so far.</p>

I will try removing my USB keyboard &amp; mouse, I will also try the intelppm removal tool. I&#39;ve tried SP3 several times &amp; the same BS. Say a prayer for me please.</p>

		                <p>I&#39;m not technical! My PC is custom with AMD chip and winfast motherboard. All OK till microsoft auto updates put SP3 on my machine. Now I suffer with randon crashes, frequent blue screens and stop numbers, doesn&#39;t log off properly and wants to check C drive every time I boot up.</p>
<p>Totally frustrated! Thank for your tech stuff on your blog but its over my head. Do I have to buy more from the people who messed up?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

		                <p>Thank you thank you!!! I&#39;ve spent the past week trying to figure out why my computer keeps rebooting (after installing the update). HP&#39;s online chat didn&#39;t help. I found your sight after much googling.</p>

		                <p>@Will McLoughlin: While SP3 may have caused the problem, you may have had an issue prior to SP3. Not specific to SP3, I&#39;ve heard of some losing desktop icons because an update went through but 99.9999% of those installed the update without an issue.</p>
<p>Thought of wiping and starting from scratch? Have you checked the &nbsp;codes from the BSOD? Not doing this ain&#39;t helping. Google the codes.</p>
