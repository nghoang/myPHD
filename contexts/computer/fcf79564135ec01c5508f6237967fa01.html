    ///*]]>*/</script> <p>I have often used those three terms almost interchangeably, yes, even computer scientist. After all, most of us have a degree in computer science, so what does that make us? However, recently I find that those three things have come to take on more and more distinct personalities in my mind. It has come to the point where if I think about someone I know &#8211; or know of &#8211; within the industry, they immediately fall into one of those three categories. Which is not to say that one person can&#39;t have attributes from all three, but regardless, they always tend to favor one most strongly and so I fit them into that category, <strong>programmer</strong>, <strong>developer </strong>or <strong>computer scientist</strong>.</p><p>It is difficult to define what each one should be, (<em>it is more of a gut feel rather than a strict delineation</em>) they are very similar (<em>and rightly so</em>), but I am going to attempt to do it anyway, cause I am a glutton for punishment :).</p><h2>Computer Scientist</h2><p
style="text-align: center;"><img
align="middle" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1442" src="http://www.skorks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/cs.jpg" style="width: 218px; height: 166px;" title="cs" vspace="5" /></p><p>They write code (<em>yeah I know it&#39;s a bit of a bombshell</em>). It may not be the prettiest or most well-factored code, but it gets the job done. It is not about the design of the code or &quot;<em>good</em>&quot; practices, it is about proving what they set out to prove. <strong>A computer scientist is as much a mathematician as they are a technologist</strong> (<em>they have 31337 math skills</em>), they don&#39;t just need to know that stuff works, they have to prove it. Communication and people skills are desirable traits, but not emphasized. Software process and team dynamics skills are desirable traits, but not emphasized. They have good breadth of general knowledge of their whole field, but they deeply specialize in one or several narrow areas. In these areas they are considered world-class experts. They work on stuff related to their research in their personal time.</p><h2>Programmer</h2><p
style="text-align: center;"><img
align="middle" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1440" src="http://www.skorks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/programmer.jpg" style="width: 163px; height: 246px;" title="programmer" vspace="5" /></p><p>Programmers write awesome code. Making it clean, well-factored and error free are very important concerns, but not at the expense of getting the job done. It is all about knowing the meaning of &quot;<em>good code</em>&quot; within their domain. They need to have some math skills, but this is not a paramount concern. They need to know of good (best) solutions to problems, but they don&#39;t need to prove it is the best solution. <strong>A good breadth of algorithmic knowledge is imperative</strong>. They have a depth of skill in a wide area of expertise and have reasonably good knowledge of related areas as well. Communication and people skills are desirable traits, but not emphasized. Software process and team dynamics skills are desirable traits, but not emphasized. They work on personal software projects they find of interest in their off time.</p><h2>Developer</h2><p
style="text-align: center;"><img
align="middle" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1441" src="http://www.skorks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/developer.jpg" style="width: 223px; height: 148px;" title="developer" vspace="5" /></p><p>They write code. Making it well-factored and clean is important, but other factors often take priority. Math skills are very much optional, but it does help to be aware of common problems and solutions related to the domain they are in. Communication and people skills are paramount. Process and team dynamics are bread and butter skills. <strong>They are consummate generalists without any truly deep specializations</strong>. They are expert at finding ways around problems and plugging components together to fulfill a set of requirements. In their personal time they are either trying to build the next Facebook, or engage in activities that have nothing to do with programming, developing, or computer science.</p><ul><li><em>Developer are programmers to a greater or lesser extent.<br
/> </em></li><li><em>Computer scientists are programmers to a greater or lesser extent.</em></li></ul><ul><li><em>Enterprise software is the domain of the developer.<br
/> </em></li><li><em>The Googles and Microsofts of the world are after programmers (and to a lesser extent computer scientists). The developers who end up there become product managers. <br
/> </em></li><li><em>RnD and academia are the domain of the computer scientist (and to a lesser extent the programmer)</em></li></ul><p>The thing to remember here is that none of the three is derogatory or &quot;<em>bad</em>&quot; in any way. One is not more or less desirable than any of the others. They are simply different dimensions (<em>with some crossover</em>) of the field we are all involved in. Particular personalities will identify more with one but that does not mean that all three can&#39;t &quot;<em>bleed</em>&quot; into each other and combine favorably. It is entirely possible to be both an awesome developer and a great programmer (<em>although it is difficult with so many important things to focus on</em>). In rare cases you may even get an all 3 in 1 type of deal, in which case I&#39;d love to hear from you, cause we should start a company together, so that I can ride your awesomeness all the way to easy-street :). But no matter where you fall, it is entirely possible to be highly successful if you fit snugly into just one of the three.</p><p><em>What about a software engineer</em>? That&#39;s just a subset of developer.</p><p><em>What about an architect</em>? They design buildings and stuff, so I am not quite sure how that&#39;s relevant :)</p><p>I do believe that I have thoroughly failed to communicate my meaning. No matter. I will throw the ball to you, dear reader. <strong>Do you see programmer, developer and computer scientist as distinct and if so are you definitions similar to mine</strong>? If not, then I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts about them being one and the same.</p><p><span

/> Ah, that is a good question and infact if you can classify people into those three categories and know which of the three you&#8217;re looking for, it becomes easier to come up with good interview questions. You know what, you have just given me an idea for a blog post :), so stay tuned, I will definitely write about this.</p></div></div></li></li></ul></li><li

/> Interesting subject.<br
/> I think there is nothing called Software Engineer/Engineering, &#8217;cause Engineering is a &#8220;predictive&#8221; thing while Software is an &#8220;un-predictive&#8221;.<br
/> Definitions:<br
/> Computer Scientist: Theoretical oriented mind, try to prove thing theoretically and see similarities between things to create a theory so that Developers and Programmers can understand the big picture easy.<br
/> Developer: (Senior Programmer) worked on and knows all Software Development Phases (Requirements, Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance).<br
/> Programmer: Knows how to code without the big picture. Give him a task and he knows well how to do it.<br
/> I think with &#8220;Agile&#8221; advent, there is no need for a programmer any more. You need someone &#8211; &#8220;Developer&#8221; &#8211; who knows and get things done in all Development Phases.<br

For me I see programmers as working at a level above (or below depending on how you look at it) developers.</p><p>For example, developers use libraries when working in enterprise, but programmers write the libraries that developers use. There are many other examples of this sort. The way i see it there are junior developers and senior ones as well as junior and senior programmers etc.</p></div></div></li><ul

Engineering does include designing &#8220;blueprints&#8221; in addition to putting something together.  Programmers program to a specification, whereas software engineers write the specification (and probably also write code too).</p><p>Architects in the software field may be even more concerned with designing the solution rather than implementation details.  Architects are also frequently concerned with integration of multiple systems, in addition to implementation of any given system.  But often, Architect is just a title with greater prestige, trying to make up for the fact that there&#8217;s no good career path for software engineers, besides moving into management.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been told by some ex-Microsoft friends that they use &#8220;program manager&#8221; as the title for someone who is a general technical person who &#8220;owns&#8221; a particular project &#8212; this is sort of the advanced developer you describe.</p></div></div></li><ul

id="dsq-comment-message-3940" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>If you are looking at this through the narrow view of application development, then it doesn&#8217;t appear to be too far off from reality.  The one exception would be that I have come to view the programmers as not exceptional coders who really aren&#8217;t concerned with how clean and well-factored it is.  They also tend to skimp on unit testing.  There is another level of skill above the programmer who is concerned with these areas and is as much or more interested in the quality of the code than in the functionality it enables.  If you broaden the view to include development of systems, some of your assertions fall apart.  First, architecture is critical when building systems.  I&#8217;ve seen too many instances where entire components had to be refactored because a developer or programmer didn&#8217;t adhere to the architecture and managed to slow parts of the system to a crawl as a result to be convinced otherwise.  Because architecture by committee is not efficient and rarely effective, the architect role is not only appropriate, but required.  But again, if all you are doing is building applications, it is probably overkill to say you are doing architecture.  That would be like an electrician saying he is architecting a light switch.  Second, software engineering is a reality.  It is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to development.  There was a time when other engineering disciplines didn&#8217;t have governing bodies either.  To say that without the governing body, they were not engineering disciplines is to put too much power into the hands of organizations of human origin.  Whether or not I am practicing a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to my work is not for anyone but me to ascertain.</p></div></div></li><ul

id="dsq-comment-message-6101" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have to agree with Sonya here.</p><p>Remember that software engineering is the most immature of all engineering disciplines. We&#8217;ve been building bridges and buildings for centuries &#8211; chemical and electrical systems to a lesser extent. But modern software development has only existed for about 30 years.</p><p>Add to that the much higher growth rate in software relative to other engineered industries, and you  start to understand the lack of widespread adoption of engineering in software. Software engineering is still evolving as new systems come along such as the Internet, distributed systems, clout computing, social networking etc. Many programmers, developers, project managers, etc. will hesitate to adopt a certain architecture or expend resources to engineer a system when there is a very real possibility that all their work will be out of date in 2 years as something better has come along or the industry has moved on.</p><p>So why then is rigorous architecture so ingrained in other industries such as mechanical, electrical and civil engineering? It&#8217;s a necessity. Without engineering, projects fall apart. There are no real consequences if your toy Web 2.0 app falls apart &#8211; maybe some commercial losses. But what if your un-engineered application was a control system for a nuclear reactor? A building, a bridge, or a train signalling system? Ouch.</p><p>Alan, have you done any research into Facebook&#8217;s architecture? There are some brilliant videos and their engineering notes blog which describe it in detail, especially their focus on scalability. Services such as Google and Facebook could not meet their load demands without a scalable architecture. This kind of architecture will not &#8220;evolve&#8221; out of a consensus &#8211; it has to be designed.</p><p>I worry that your attitude of &#8220;Architecture is not used, therefore it&#8217;s not needed&#8221; is counterproductive and will only serve to reinforce the already observed industry-wide skepticism about engineering in software.</p><p>What&#8217;s missing from this post is the acknowledgement that people can fit into one of the three categories but still be bad at what they do. Not all programmers &#8220;write awesome code&#8221;.  Not all computer scientists have 31337 math skills. Not all developers have awesome people skills.</p><p>I can only speak on my experience as a programmer &#8212; In projects without the discipline of clean, modularised architecture, programmers will often revert to worst practices. If they have the time, they might do some refactoring but in reality, in high pressure environments with looming deadlines and no architecture enforced by management, programmers will be expected to achieve their task as quickly as possible &#8211; and this is often at the expense of code quality and thorough testing.</p></div></div></li></li></ul></li></ul></li><li

There are economic ecosystems that drive the behaviors you&#8217;re talking about.  A computer scientist doesn&#8217;t /need/ well-factored code to write a good paper.

The only part I don&#8217;t fully agree with is the very small touch on what a software engineer is. I see those as being something kinda halfway between your definition of programmer and scientist, but definitely not a developer. SE is a bit beyond a developer. The UI/UX stuff involved is very developer-centric, but the math and coding involved is a bit above where your definition places them. Just my view, and SE is kind of a job title anyway. An SE at one company may be any of your three personas and different at another.</p></div></div></li><ul

/> Just like a bridge architect designs the bridge&#8217;s lines and function, converses with the structural engineer to validate the possibilities (and come up with new ones), gets shop drawings made by the field experts which are then built by the builders, so do software architects design the global component and interaction architecture, discussing with computer scientists the latest advances and possibilities, then getting key component pieces built by programmers and the glue finalized by developers.</p></div></div></li></li><li

Choosing the right components, technologies, hardware, network topology, etc. for the system framework, and then clarifying which features of each of these should be used (and why), for which aspect of the system. Simultaneously, they&#8217;re collecting brainstorming feedback, use cases, and design considerations, and developing a concise and consistent nomenclature with schemas/taxonomies, in order to enable all of the members of the design and development team to communicate with each other to efficiently instantiate the &#8220;progressively rendered&#8221; vision of their specific sub-systems, while also ensuring that the integration of these components into a coherent system goes smoothly and predictably with each build&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what term describes the role better than &#8216;Architect&#8217;.</p><p>It&#8217;s not an easy role, and it&#8217;s equal parts knowledge, experience, and intuition, but when it&#8217;s done well, it can be a beautiful thing.</p></div></div></li></li><li

/> then you have the software engineer who, according to the college curriculums I’ve seen, comes out with just being able to write a ‘clear’ spec, but in my experience, should be or deals with the software development PROCESS which includes stuff like implementation of enterprise services like (i.e.) MSMQ, (i.e.) couchDb, continuous integration, bug tracker, (and less like, but importantly) flowcharts, use cases, etc.<br
/> then, you have the programmer, who is concerned with the implementation of all of the above and as a senior programmer becomes more involved or aware of design patterns. a good programmer does not really get his dick hard about whether his code looks like the template pattern or a poor man&#8217;s template pattern. The good computer programmer knows that first you get it to work and then you refactor (maybe see duct-tape programmer with a grain of salt).<br
/> By the above definitions I don’t see how you can be an engineer of the process without being in the trenches programming first. Therefore, software engineering in college is bullshit.<br
/> Finally, the architect is the software engineer and computer programmer. he&#8217;s gotten to a point that can&#8217;t be reached by unless he&#8217;s been both a software engineer and a computer programmer. He might be a little below the software engineer in that he defines a pattern that can be a cookie-cutter pattern for the programmers in the team to follow and learn from to follow in similar features throughout the application but he does not give a shit about writing the shit down on paper or graphs or any of that bullshit. As a matter of fact the ‘engineer’ from school should consult with the architect as to whether the shit is plausible or not.<br
/> i also need to throw in there that engineering (i might need some backup here) is that which evaluates the tradeoffs between cost, quality, and price to get the job done.<br
/> a developer is that dude who works with the business to develop the product from the group up, somewhat akin to a real estate developer. Again, I don’t see how a good developer can justify his existence without being in the trenches first.</p></div></div></li><ul

/> I used to be the &#8220;computer scientist&#8221; back at the university years, probably because doing the maths was one of the requirements, even if I loved what I used to do.<br
/> After I started my first (and current) job I became more of a programmer because of the requirements of my job at that time, and then again, I loved what I used to do.<br
/> A few years later, as I get more freedom/promotions in my job, I am turning to be a proud developer :-) I like to write less implementation code and more &#8220;foundation code&#8221;, leaving the implementation details to the juniors and only helping them out with the &#8220;hard&#8221; problems :-)<br
/> I think many developers follow the same path as I did, and I don&#8217;t know if the order in which the three roles are presented was a coincidence or not, but I think for many people it&#8217;s the logical order of &#8220;evolution&#8221;.</p></div></div></li></li><li

So it depends on where u major and what u do. Am a programmer and also a developer. All to profesional level, holds my b.sc m.sc in cs. Thoug u need some raw knowledge(pratical knowlegde outside school)and certifications, to get the real deal. All will give u what u may need in lyf. Nice article</p></div></div></li></li><li

It appears in the job descriptions or job titles of a whole lot of people who make a whole lot of money doing work that matters. Search Monster for the term and you&#8217;ll find a very long list of available positions. A 2010 CNN/Money.com poll listed &#8220;software architect&#8221; as the top job in the US.

Of course they are simplified, but well, they are just categories, and there are Swedish people who are African American, if you want accuracy, you need to have as many categories as there are people. And yeah, some people don&#8217;t work under the same title that define them as a coder.</p><p>I think I myself fall in the category of a programmer, who would like to be a bit more of a developer. I love going into detail with code, refining every stupid space to their right place and crap like that. I enjoy making open source modules and making really obscure coding solutions that make other people tear their eyes out, but I just love how they look, and their cleverness. I tear my eyes out when I see my old code or some architect fella&#8217;s 50 file 10k-liner class mess that could&#8217;ve been a three-liner, and I really enjoy demo scene and all those things that are sometimes perceived as nerdy perversions.</p><p>But on the other hand, I&#8217;m pretty open and outgoing person, and I really don&#8217;t look like a programmer, I actually look more like a musician, which I also am. But still, I&#8217;m pretty much used to just coding alone, so I&#8217;d like to develop (program?) my communication skills to achieve better results in team projects.

id="dsq-comment-message-7222" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;m late to the party here.  Distinctions like this are mostly arbitrary, is there a use for drawing these lines?<br
/> But going by this system, I used to be very much a computer scientist when I was young &#8211; like High School before I could get a significant math  background.  Over time I became more of a Programmer, focusing more on simple code that works as well as possible.  Some of the very clever ways I&#8217;ve implemented things in the past would be unacceptable in my mind today for any product (as opposed to an experimental software).<br
/> Lately I&#8217;ve been moving toward being a Developer.  Building software is fundamentally a team activity.  You have to make it easy for the team to collaborate.  Using a third party component reduces the amount of code you must design, write and maintain.  Although it does come with its own risks, it&#8217;s usually the better choice.<br
/> The Architect is there to make sure the team as a whole produces good, cohesive code.  The members of a team might all produce great pieces with different mechanics that don&#8217;t fit together well, switching between these pieces you have to know each one individually.  I see a lot of value in this position, although the title sucks. :)</p></div></div></li></li><li

I first started programming BASIC in 1994 when I was 14 and now I like to find new ways to exploit whatever language (Ruby/Java) I&#8217;m working with while solving problems I come across in the clearest way possible. I am a stickler for things such as indentation, naming conventions, clean/maintainable code, DRY, etc&#8230; I am somewhat of an un-official mentor where I work to the &#8220;green&#8221; programmers so that they can learn about important topics early on. About a year ago, I started work on my own maven archetype/framework where I integrate Spring (Security), Vaadin/JPAContainer, JPA/Hibernate, et al&#8230; but haven&#8217;t really hammered at it for a minute.  This is eventually going to be one of my flagship projects. Despite the fact that I do not have a degree (I did go to college, though!), I think I&#8217;ve done pretty well for myself. I&#8217;ve come to the realization that a degree is good if you wanna get rich working for someone else, but you don&#8217;t really need one when working for yourself.</p></div></div></li></li><li

I also feel you left out one crucial group: hackers, but more about that later.</p><p>Firstly, the computer scientists. There are possibly degrees of computer scientist and I believe that one is the general comp sci grad of which you speak, who generally builds systems themselves to see how they work, rarely use frameworks or boilerplates. They prefer to pick it apart themselves rather than just have it handed to them. They write less emergent code and more building-block code. Then there&#8217;s the second degree of computer scientist, the ones who don&#8217;t have a bachelor&#8217;s or master&#8217;s, but a doctorate in comp sci; the sort of person who has dedicated their lives to advancing the actual science of programming. They normally write huge research software like Neural-nets, genetic algorithms and other sorts of software that are purely experimental. Computer scientists also like writing their own languages and toolchains for them. They&#8217;re the sort of people who write esolangs like Brainfuck, and some more useful languages like Scala.</p><p>Now hackers. I certainly don&#8217;t mean those snot-nosed skiddies that you see in the headlines nowadays, breaking into poorly protected sites with simple SQL injections or brute-force attacks on FTP ports. I&#8217;m talking about the kind of people who write cracks and hacks for software that involves disassembling the native binaries and re-writing them in C for the hell of it, or the authors of extremely advanced malicious code like stuxnet. The sort of people who LIVE in assembly, know the entire x86 assembly instruction listing and exactly which one to use. Hackers like ASM, C, and Perl.</p></div></div></li><ul

id="dsq-comment-message-7847" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think in part it depends on where you live &amp; work. Hwever, I would assume most of the respondents to this article are based in the US. I live &amp; work in Australia &amp; we obviously use the job titles &amp; terminology a little differently than you, although essentially its pretty close &amp; all of the above mentioned roles fall under a fairly small umbrella. Over here, the term computer scientist has pretty much died the last decade. Bachelor of Computer Science degrees as such are almost unheard of now &amp; have been replaced by a Bachelor of Computing, the course content is still the same sort of thing though. I think it&#8217;s because Computer Science used to be a part of university science faculty&#8217;s but as the student demand grew so much the last 10-15yrs universities began establishing separate faculties for their computing courses. So as they were no longer were a part of the science faculty they altered the degree title from Computer Science to Computing. Interestingly the Information Systems degrees that are still very common here, which sure are  pretty much the opposite of what we do, as in their graduates become specialist users of the programmes &amp; software we spend our lives creating, are all still part of the business/commerce facultiies in our universities&#8230;. In recent years though, Bachelor ofComputing degrees which take 3 years have begun to incorporate more aspects of web design than in the past. Quite a few degrees are even offered as a 4 yr combined degree in Computing &amp; Media, as sometimes called or Computing &amp; Graphic Design. It&#8217;s also really common for people wanting to go into our industry as &#8220;software engineers&#8221;  to study a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) which takes 4 yrs &amp; the first 2 are made up of the same subjects as every other engineering student. That&#8217;s what I did &amp; we weren&#8217;t able to select a specialty to study until year 3 so in the first 2 yrs we all had to do basic intro units in all engineering fields like civil, mechanical, aerospace &amp; chemical plus Calculus, Physics &amp; chemistry!!! So I&#8217;m a real engineer but qualified in Software &amp; yeah I&#8217;m a 27 yo chick too!!! The tern Software Engineer is really common here &amp; I think closest to being a cross of how you describe programming &amp; computer science. I think the longer your career goes on too the more blurred your title becomes because it&#8217;s pretty normal to migrate from one platform to the next learning new skills &amp; languages as we go. When I graduated I was more knowledgable about the client/back end side of things but I&#8217;ve since i graduated ive picked up PHP,  Perl &amp; Ruby. Plus I can of course write XHTML/CSS/JS &amp; am now learning some Ajax &amp; improving my SQL &amp; Java. Ive moved around a few jobs the last 10 yrs so its allowed me to branch out more so I&#8217;m not actually sure I fit in any of your little boxes!!!!.</p></div></div></li></li><li

The new category is called: IDIOTS. They know components and know what they&#8217;re for, but don&#8217;t have a clue at what it actually is. They don&#8217;t know anything about the internals and the only thing they know is that their bosses are even bigger idiots and that they will pay the salary even if they don&#8217;t solve the problems.</p></div></div></li><ul

From my experience, in a team of &#8216;programmers&#8217;, the least experienced is usually the team manager or &#8216;developer&#8217; in this instance. As a team&#8217;s &#8216;developer&#8217; I would be handling tasks such as hiring, communicating progress in lamex terms for clients etc in addition to what programming I could manage. There is value in a good developer though, e.g a good web dev would be specialized in seo, smm, and design, areas that few programmers specialize, in addition to understanding the web framework.</p></div></div></li></li></ul></li><li

/> Programmer Analyst: Expected to be able to progam applications that integrate between different systems.<br
/> Systems Analyst: Expected to Design Information Architecture to improve business information systems<br
