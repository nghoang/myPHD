<br />
In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's memory&nbsp;and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("72526",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("72526")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Branch_(computer_science)">branches</a><span class="hp" id="m72526"><div class="hpHeader">Branch (computer science)</div><div class="hpContent">A branch is sequence of code in a computer program which is conditionally executed depending on whether the flow of control is altered or not .

Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally&nbsp;so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("75040",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("75040")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Subroutine">subroutine</a><span class="hp" id="m75040"><div class="hpHeader">Subroutine</div><div class="hpContent">In computer science, a subroutine  is a portion of code within a larger program that performs a specific task and is relatively independent of the remaining code....</div><br></span>s by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.<br />
<br />
Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("25668",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("25668")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Control_flow">flow of control</a><span class="hp" id="m25668"><div class="hpHeader">Control flow</div><div class="hpContent">In computer science, control flow  refers to the order in which the individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imperative or a declarative program are executed or evaluated....</div><br></span>&nbsp;within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.<br />

Comparatively, a person using a pocket <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("26925",this,"calculator.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("26925")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Calculator">calculator</a><span class="hp" id="m26925"><div class="hpHeader">Calculator</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i26925"></div>An electronic calculator  is a small, portable, usually inexpensive electronic device used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic. Modern calculators are more portable than most computers, though most PDAs are comparable in size to handheld calculators.The first solid-state electronic...</div><br></span>&nbsp;can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time—with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. For example:<br />
<br />
       mov #0, sum     ; set sum to 0<br />
       mov #1, num     ; set num to 1<br />
 loop: add num, sum    ; add num to sum<br />
       add #1, num     ; add 1 to num<br />
       cmp num, #1000  ; compare num to 1000<br />
       ble loop        ; if num <= 1000, go back to 'loop'<br />
       halt            ; end of program. stop running<br />
<br />
Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in about a millionth of a second.<br />

The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode, the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from—each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data.

The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into a series of control signals which activate other parts of the computer. Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance.<br />
<br />
A key component common to all CPUs is the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("72168",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("72168")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Program_counter">program counter</a><span class="hp" id="m72168"><div class="hpHeader">Program counter</div><div class="hpContent">The program counter , commonly called the instruction pointer  in Intel x86 microprocessors, and sometimes called the instruction address register, or just part of the instruction sequencer in some computers, is a processor register that indicates where the computer is in its instruction sequence...</div><br></span>, a special memory cell (a <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("98739",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("98739")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Processor_register">register</a><span class="hp" id="m98739"><div class="hpHeader">Processor register</div><div class="hpContent">In computer architecture, a processor register is a small amount of storage available as part of a CPU or other digital processor.

<br />
The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:<br />

<ol>
<li> Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.</li>
<li> Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.</li>
<li> Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.</li>
<li> Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.</li>
<li> Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.</li>
<li> If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.</li>
<li> Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.</li>
<li> Jump back to step (1).</li></ol>
<br />
<br />
Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as "jumps" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("74681",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("74681")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Control_flow">control flow</a><span class="hp" id="m74681"><div class="hpHeader">Control flow</div><div class="hpContent">In computer science, control flow  refers to the order in which the individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imperative or a declarative program are executed or evaluated....</div><br></span>).<br />

<div class='thumb tright'><img src='http://image.absoluteastronomy.com/images/encyclopediaimages/m/ma/magnetic_core.jpg'/></div>A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered "address" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to "put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595". The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.<br />

<H3>Multitasking</H3><br />
<br />
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.<br />
<br />
One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("99637",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("99637")' href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Interrupt">interrupt</a><span class="hp" id="m99637"><div class="hpHeader">Interrupt</div><div class="hpContent">In computing, an interrupt is an asynchronous signal indicating the need for attention or a synchronous event in software indicating the need for a change in execution....</div><br></span>&nbsp;which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time", then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.<br />
<br />
Before the era of cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer.<br />
<br />
Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly&nbsp;— in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running. However, most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run at the same time without unacceptable speed loss.<br />
