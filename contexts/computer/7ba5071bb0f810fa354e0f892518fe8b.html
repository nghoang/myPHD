<b>Oct 2009: Where can I get my laptop repaired?
</b>
<i>
<p>
I reviewed old messages but didn't find any posting on computer
repair. Is it true that people have to go either to Best Buy or
Compuusa or something to repair their computer? Or buy a new
computer? My Laptop died suddenly and few people, including
Best Buy told us my hard desk died and needed a new one. Best
Buy says it will cost more than $350 to repair it. Of course,
that makes me think i should get a new laptop then. But really?
I looked around for computer repair service but it doesn't
exist. Does anyone know if there is such a service called
computer repair? or do we only have Best Buy?
can't afford new pc
</i>
<hr>
Try Area Computer and Service Center at 915 University Avenue
in Berkeley. I had a broken laptop and was quoted an outrageous
amount at Best Buy. My brother recommended this place and he
fixed my computer for a fraction of the price Best Buy was
charging. The number is 510-843-0388
anon

<hr>
Computer repair at Best Buy is a scam especially when it comes
to hard drive repair.  (Just do a Google search and you will
find tons of complaints.)  There geek guys are not trained to
do repairs, they are just trained to up-sell customers new
equipment.  The Geeks who do know how to fix computers
(especially hard drives) are threatened with being fired it
they do the simple repairs that do not make Best Buy a huge
profit.  There are blog posts from Geek Squad guys telling
customers how sorry they are for having to lie to customers
telling them their hard drive is beyond repair so they will buy
a new computer.
<p>
There's an association for IT Professionals in the Bay Area
called Pacific IT Professionals, http://www.pacitpros.org I
would contact them for a referral.
Anon

<hr>
I recommend you at least call Info-Gate, Mark Rosen, for a
consultation.  I trust them completely with all of my computer
issues and they have saved me tons in repair costs by noticing
something small.  Phone is (510) 808-0370, and they work all
over the Bay Area.  Email is mrosen@info-gate.com.  He owns the
company and has a terrific staff.

<hr>
There are SCADS of repair folks there.  Here are some.  I've used
the first (and would use them again), would have no qualms using
the next two (the first guy was just a little more convenient for
me to get to), and had the fourth recommended to me when I posted
a similar question last spring:
<pre>
1.  Authorized Computer Repair
    (510) 786-7103
    oncallcomputerguy@gmail.com
    www.authorizedcomputers.com
    (did a great job switching a new laptop from Vista to XP and
    then getting an old one working after it stopped booting)

2,  Berkeley Students Computer Service
    (510) 495-6333
    info@bscs.us
    http://bscs.us/
    (smart students / know what they're doing)

4.  Infogate
    (510) 808-0370

    (may be more business-oriented but you can always ask)

I have used LMi.net for computer repair. They are our Internet
Service Provider, but they also do computer repair. They are good
at virus removal as well as general computer tune-ups. I
recommend them for Internet service as well as computer repair.

<hr>
I had a really great experience with: My Computer Guy, 1501
Eastshore Hwy, Berkeley, CA 94710, Phone: (510) 524-9221.  He
fixes hardware problems, really knowledgeable, will tell you if
cost of repair is worth it. Will find used parts at less cost on
E-Bay or other places if he can. I hope it's not too rude to say
that like some engineer-types, he can be a little hard to
communicate with, he's not greatest at the social niceties, but
his work was excellent, reasonably priced, and he saved me from
having to buy a new laptop with a practical repair that was
elegant in its simplicity (disconnected something that was
interfering with entire computer, and since I never used it, it
did no harm to just disconnect, and much cheaper than trying to
actually fully replace).


<hr>
There are lots of small computer repair businesses around.  Ask
friends and co-workers if they recommend anyone.  Jonathan at
Authorized Computer Repair in Berkeley fixed some hardware
problems with my PC laptop, and I would call them back in a
heartbeat if I had another problem.  You can reach them at 510-
786-7103.
Andi

<hr>
We've taken our computers to Leon, who owns/runs Domino
Computers, on Adeline, for years.  We've sent lots of friends and
family to him, too.  His number is 653-6286.

<hr>
Give Jonathan Wishnev a call.  He's great to work with-
knowledgeable, trustworthy and super friendly.  He's incredible
with all sorts of Mac & PC repairs.  He'll come to your house or
office and even does remote support. (So weird to see the cursor
moving on someone else's command)  His know-how is responsible
for keeping countless Bay Area computers out of landfills.

Jason Webster of MacAssistant is great!  He is extremely knowledgeable

audio and video
solutions for Macs.  His number is (415) 987-1280.

I highly recommend Ron Huppert of rhSystems.  He's worked
wonders for me and my family soloving a wide range of computer
problems including pc troubleshooting, wireless networking
problems, and general questions about what products to
purchase. (He recently saved the contents on my 83 year old
fathers's hard drive that had crashed.)  He's knowledgable,
reliable and reasonably priced.  He even does house calls.  I
can't say enough about him.

We recently called Becky Waring (becky@waring.org) to help clean out old PCs, upgrade
a Mac, connect printers, and solve a seemingly intractable printer problem.  Becky went
to MIT, is extremely knowledgeable, tenacious and competent, and will really take the
time to solve the problem. In one instance, Becky used her own time to devise a
solution without charging us for it.  I definitely plan to have her help us in the future.

Bought a new Dell laptop.  Had to accept Vista.  Would rather have

http://www.tech-buddies.net/ Came highly recommended by others that 
have used them so I called and these guys are GREAT!! And VERY 
reasonably priced. Having a little one of my own it's often hard to 
find the time to get things done let alone take a heavy computer 
somewhere. These guys came to ME and fixed everything within an hour 
and took care of other issues and answered all of my questions...and I 
know my questions were silly. I felt very safe when they were in my 
home. Call them...you won't be disappointed.

Original poster here.  Had a couple of tips (thanks), but wanted to 
let the community know about a super company in town:  Authorized PC 
Repair, conveniently located in new digs at Virginia and MLK Way.

Our Dell also went kaput a couple of years ago, following a 
cross-country move.  I did a hasty internet search and found 
Carl Nussbaum, of Nussbaum Computer Repair (carlnuss@yahoo.com, 
(510) 540-8347, 2618 College Ave, Berkeley).  For ~$120 (way 
cheaper than buying a new one), he quickly repaired our poor 
PC, saving most of our files, and reinstalled MS Office Suite.  
He's very friendly, and I would absolutely recommend his 
services.  BTW, our Dell is still working, and it has been over 
two years since he repaired it!

<hr>
I can't recommend this guy highly enough - George Tsai, 510-307-
9878. I'm not sure he would want me to give out his cell and 
that's what he usually answers, but leave a message on that 
land line & he'll get back. He has been repairing my computers 
& dealing with viruses, hackers, firewalls, networks, updates, 
cloning, etc. for my business for over 10 years. He is 
reasonable, does not nit-pick on fees, takes responsibility and 
comes back without charge if the problem persists (it usually 
doesn't). Security threats constantly morph and he's on top of 
it. He has large co. clients with giant, multi-location 
networks, and he also works with the little people like me. 
He's a little brash but he's a genius and he's fair. I know 
nothing, but it sounds like either a security issue or maybe 
your equipment is obsolete. Anyway, tell him I sent you and 
good luck.

I need computer tech help in Walnut Creek.  Can you recommend 
someone who makes house calls, is reasonably priced, and who can 
talk to an elderly person in non-tech speak?  Thanks!
Computer Idiot

<hr>
I've been using Info-Gate for several years now and am thrilled at 
the service and care I've received.  My elderly mother has used 
them as well.  Mark Rosen is the owner, and has a wonderful staff 
that makes house calls.  His office is in Oakland, but I've never 
been there as the techs always come to me!  Call him at (510) 
808-0370.  He lives in Pleasant HIll, I think, so has an affinity 
for the East Bay.  email is mrosen@info-gate.com

<hr>
I have a guy I can recommend. His name is Bryan, and he 
specializes in 'tweaking' computers that have become slow. He also 
does diagnosis and repair of other computer problems, as well as 
installation and setup of new computers. He also does training on 
internet, email and windows updates.  He can recommend and install 
software to keep your computer tuned, and show you how to use it. 
He's worked on my computer as well as my sister's and my parents', 
and we can all recommend him. He doesn't work on Macs or network 
problems, so he charges a lot less than others, like Geeksquad. 
He's in WC, but makes housecalls throughout the Bay Area. He can 
be reached at 925-285-1507.
Good luck with your PC.
<hr>
Definitely call CyberDoc, they came to my home office and quickly 
dealt with my computer issues, they are very nice, knowlegeable 
and accessible. I also felt their pricing was fair and affordable. 
If you have internet access they can then help you remotely which 
means that any future problems you have can be solved in minutes. 
Contact Sebastian Stuart at 510-492-9237 and their website is

<b>Nov 2008: computer technician to help with disk problem
</b>
<p>
<i>
Hi, I've checked the archives, but would like current recommendations 
for a trusted computer service repair person.  We've never gotten in the 
habit of backing up the computer hard disk-drive.  Once the drive became 
full, we installed a second drive and a friend copied everything over to 
the new larger drive.  The problem being the digital photos (our 
wedding, babies, etc) somehow aren't fully readable (we used Adobe 
Photoshop for storage).  The images seem to be there, but when you click 
to open a file, a different image displays.  And now the kicker, the new 
disk-drive won't boot up.  I fear we've permanently lost our photos and 
other miscellaneous files.  I'd like to find someone to get the drive 
working, but more importantly to recover the photos and files.
Thanks.

<hr>
I highly recommend Sebastian Stuart with CyberDoc. He and the other 
technicians in the company are knowleable, friendly and very responsive.

I was having some computer problems, probematic firewall, decreasing 
computer performance and I needed help fine-tuning my small office 
network. They came and did all of that for a reasonable price. They also 
set up a program that enables them to troubleshoot and fix my computers 
from a distance which is amazing! I call them and we initiate a online 
session where CyberDoc gains access to my computer and they go about 
fixing the problem remotely. They returned my call promptly and I had 
some printer issues that they fixed in a matter of minutes.

You can contact Sebastian at 510-452-9237 - ext 101.

If you want further information, please contact me at 510-569-7246 or 
email.

Tell Sebastian that Catherine sent you.

I wanted to offer my recommendation for a fantastic computer consulting company here 
in Berkeley. Computer Courage, ran by Adam Schwartz is wonderful. Our company had gone 
through 5 computer techs in 2 years... I finally buckled down and started doing phone 
interviews with several computer techs in the area. Using BPN as a resource, I found 
Adam and his company Computer Courage. A young dynamic professional who has a crew 
that is both highly knowledgeable, professional and personable. We are very pleased, 
excited and confident to have Adam and his team as our computer techs. I highly 
recommend them for your business and/or home.

<b>June 2007: Computer (PC) repair
</b>
<p>
<i>
I have a desktop computer (originally custom-built) which is a bit old (Windows 2000 
Pro), but has a lot of data on it and is attached to many peripherals (scanner, 
printers, Network, etc.).  It has recently been showing signs of ''age'' with 
unexplained dropping out of USB connections, temporary loss of sound capabilities, etc., 
and I am looking for someone who will come to my Home Office (El Sobrante) to check the 
machine out; fix it; or consider installation of a totally new machine, but with 
preservation of the data on the old machine.  I am of ''intermediate'' computer savvy 
but will not attempt to ''open up the box'', and need someone who will help me to get 
fully up and running again.  I prefer someone with a ''track record'' (who has been in 
business for a while).  Please contact me via e-mail and give your phone number, as I 
would like to speak with you in person.  Many thanks,  Bob Fink

<b>June 2006: Computer overhaul recommendation?

Can anyone recommend a person or business who can overhaul 
our son's laptop computer. It is full of viruses 
and ''bugs'' so he needs it made ''like new'' before he goes 
off to UC Santa Cruz in the fall (as a freshman). I took 
it to a place on Bancroft near the Cal campus and they did 
not do a satisfactory job.

We had a similar problem with my son's laptop last fall and
used BBC Computer Specialist at 510-325-5522. We got their
name from a previous recommendation on the Parents Network
and I strongly second that recommendation. They came and
picked up the computer, kept it for a day or two and retured
it problem free, after rebuilding the hard drive. Cost was $100

In response to the person who needs someone to overhaul a computer:  I have had very good 
experience with Andy Spalaris.  He does computer work for UC Berkeley, but also does private 
consulting.  He will come to your house or, if it's a laptop, you can let him take the

For several years now, I have used a great computer tech
named Paul Paz y Mino for work like this. He has done
several computers for me, with a total overhaul including
reinstalling the operating system and all the software to
make it really clean. He also checks it over and suggests
easy things to make it run better like more memory or a
faster drive, then tells you exactly what you need and the
absolute cheapest place to buy it. His rates are very
reasonable. I recently bought two used computers for my
business that were a real steal (a business liquidation)
and Paul got them up to speed for me. He's also a really
nice guy! You can reach Paul at ppaz[at]igc.org

I strongly recommend Berkeley computer consultant Max Weinryb (848-8996).
He has done numerous projects for me, my husband, and many friends
including dealing with hardware and software problems, installing upgrades,
adding memory, replacing fans, eliminating viruses, and setting up networks.
Excellent skills, completely reliable, and a nice guy. For most projects, he
guarantees his work: If he doesn't solve your problem, he doesn't charge you. He
has always solved our problems -- fast -- and his rates are low.

Hi - I'm looking for recent recommendations for a computer geek-type service to come and 1. install a wireless network (this may include setting up one of the computers which is still in the box, printer, etc.), and 2. advising about/fixing the "???" that constantly (CONSTANTLY!) runs on the older/current PC.  Something is running in the background which I can neither find, nor stop.  Not sure if I have a virus, spyware, or ???

Here's a recommendation for a remarkable computer consultant. 
His name is Rob Gross, and you can reach him at 338-0101. One of
my favorite things about him is that he will come to your house
or business, fix your computer, and tell you what you need to do
in terms of ongoing hardware and software protection and safety.
 He is competant, reliable and amazingly personable.
Need to use it, don't want to fix it!

I'd like to recommend Steve Abbitt of MOJO-IT for computer

with a complete disaster, and once with some minor problems.

I work from home and don't have IT support; I'm sleeping much 
better knowing that I can call Steve if my computer crashes.  
He's fast, friendly, reasonably priced, knowledgeable, and 
soothing when you're on the edge of hysteria.

<b>March 2005: someone to clean up our computer?</b>

Our Windows XP computer is rife with pop-ups, arcane error 
messages, and possibly spyware. It works OK, but not as 
efficiently as we'd like, particularly since we have a 15-year-
old (and sometimes her friends) roaming around on it. The BPN 
computer consultant postings are a little old; can anyone 
recommend a consultant who'd come over to our house in central 
Berkeley for an hour or two, do some clean-up, and make some 
recommendations? Some idea of his/her hourly rate would be nice 
as well.

Help!  I need someone to fix my computer, which has gone 
bonkers.  I  have a 3.5-year-old Dell that I 've never had any 
problems with.  But now I am constantly getting messages I 
cannot understand and, being a technophobe, I just ignore them 
and plow ahead.  Lately I have trouble shutting down or 
rebooting (is that the word?).  I was keeping track of the 
various error messages; now I have given up.  I need a computer 
repair person to come to my home.  I don't do anything with my 
computer other than check email, draft the occasional document 
for work and download (upload?) digital photos.  I checked the 
recommendations; the most recent is from May 2002.  Does anyone 
have any current recommendations?  I did find one person whose 
rate was $100/hour.  Is that the going rate?  What should I 
expect?  I need this person to 1) fix what is ailing my computer 
and 2) do any maintenance stuff I should've been doing all 
along.  Thanks!

$100/hr for PC diagnostics and repair sounds steep.  You should 
be able to find qualified help for half that cost.  That $100/hr 
rate may include a premium for making a house call and you will 
surely find a better rate at a shop if you take the computer in 
yourself.

Ludovic Ibarra 415-652-2068-he's in Alameda. He has been very

I'd like to recommend BBC Computer Specialists (510-325-5522). 
We had a problem with our PC that Dell's lousy Customer Service 
couldn't help us fix. Based on a yellow pages listing, we 
called BBC. Charley Plock, one of the cofounders, picked up the 
computer within hours, did the appropriate first-step 
troubleshooting and recovering, and dropped it off. 
Unfortunately, the problem recurred. Again, Charley picked up 
the computer, determined that the hard drive needed to be 
replaced, helped get one within 24 hours from Dell, and had the 
computer back in our hands within one business day after 
receiving the hard drive. We didn't have to drive anywhere and 
the total bill was only $100. Charley was pleasant and 
professional, and responsive to questions that we phoned in 
during and after the repair.

I'm not sure if you are willing to take your computers to

you're willing to take them somewhere, I highly recommend Leon,

diagnose and fix anything.  Their phone number is 653-6287.

From your description, it sounds like you have the RPC bug, which
came out back in November. You can remove it using a tool from the Symantec
website.
If you're not a computer person, you should definitely keep virus software
up to date and automatic updates for both it and Windows enabled. Don't 
cancel out of it when it pops up... You need for it to be keeping track of it.

I'm hoping to hire someone with software management skills who can help
clean up a hodge-podge hard drive and teach me how to maintain it better.
                
I have a 4-year-old PC with Windows 95 OS.  It came with a bunch of
software, much of which we don't use, and we've installed more.
Recent software additions have started to affect unrelated
programs, for example, upgrading NetScape resulted in problems
shutting the computer down.  I don't think this is due to a virus, but
results from my limited software-management skills.  Recently
I bought a computer program for my academic work that that operates best
using virtual memory.  I'm afraid to use it because of what I might mess
up.  I hope you know someone who can help me reorganize my machine!

If you are on campus you might check out the Computer Assistance Program. They

of undergraduates that have some computer experience and are often quite skilled. 


<hr>
I've seen several calls for computer help on the list recently so
I thought I would try to start a response thread on how to hire
someone and have the best chance of success. I'm sure there are
other computer professionals on the list who can add to this.
Consider whether taking the computer to a store might not make the
most sense. The advantages include having a reputation, clear
policies (not necessarily good, just clear), presumably some measure
of training and oversight, better recourse in the event of a problem.
It's unlikely that you would be ripped off at a brick and mortar
store. The disadvantages are that you have to schlep the computer,
some problems can only be solved in situ, the best computer techs
are not working for $8/hour at CompUSA.
<p>
If you decide to find someone to visit your house to look at your computer,
here are some suggestions for what to do:
<p>
1. Have a written list of your issues and the resolutions that you
would like to see. Make a checklist that will be used at the end
of the tech's visit to agree upon what has been completed. You
should run through a standard list of checks beyond the work that
was done to make sure the machine still functions properly. While
the tech is still there, you should include in your check the
following frequent problems (ideally you would do these checks before the
tech starts, also - that way everyone agrees that they used to work):
<p>
Can you still print (Number one problem after the tech leaves)?
Does the modem still work? Connection to the internet? 
Zip drive still working? If on a PC, does it have its old drive letter? 
CD ROM drive still working? If on a PC, same drive letter? 
Screensaver setting still the same? 
Does "mission-critical" software still launch?
Has the screen resolution or color depth been changed? If so you should 
check any programs that might rely on those settings (mostly  games, 
but also some high end graphics programs).
<p>
2. Know how much you want to spend. Have your prospective employee
look over your list and give you an estimate. Some people may not be
willing to give you a firm amount (the situation is often difficult
to discern without sitting at the console).  I think that's okay,
but they should be able to give you a rough guess of the time
involved. Certainly after they examine the machine they should be
able to give you an accurate measure of how long it will take.
<p>
3. Get references.
<p>
4. Backup your machine before your techie arrives or pay the tech
to do it. It cannot be stressed enough. You must backup the files
you cannot afford to lose.
<p>
5. Have everything about your computer, hardware and software, out
and available including all manuals, the registration numbers and/or 
cd keys. There's no sense in paying the tech to wait for you to find
stuff. As an aside, do not ask the tech to install pirated software.
<p>
6. Offer the tech a glass of water. Often they like chocolate, too.
<p>
7. Clean and organize the area the tech will be working in before
she arrives.
<p>
I hope this helps get the ball rolling and we can generate a thorough 
list regarding hiring a tech to work on your home computer.

I don't know anyone that could come to your house but I do know of a Mac

questions.  If your connection is as slow as you say it is, it may be

and he may be able to give you some insight into your problem, if you can
get there. You can find the message board at:

I can't recommend <b>Rob Bradshaw</b> highly enough! He does Mac and Windows, 
and is very good - software and hardware configuration, installation, 
troubleshooting... He used to be a Software QA Engineer, and then went 
out on his own so that he could work more directly with people. Give hime 
a call and tell him I (John Tangney) sent you. 
<p>

Almost all his clients are private individuals with computers at home, 
some of them in a home office situation. He has also worked at Head Royce 
in a computer support role, and one of his clients is the new Chabot 
Observatory. 

<p>


Rob's is very people oriented. His first priority is making sure that the 
client gets what s/he needs in a timely and cost-effective fashion. He is 
NOT ego-bound!

<p>

Rob and I worked together at two separate companies over the years, he in 
a QA role, and I in a Software Engineerin role. If you know the way that 
goes, you'll appreciate it when I say that the stereotypically 
adversarial relationship between Engineering and QA was greately 
softened, largely due to Rob's efforts. He would do things like bring in 
cookies for all the engineers to make the bug reports more palatable!

Rob's number: 
     (925) 256-5673 (pager)

I want to recommend Rob Gross (510-338-0101,
rgross[at]esoftltd.com).  I have a small business and he has been my
technology consultant for many years.

Here are the things I especially like about him:

1. He is very intelligent, clear and articulate.  If I have a
problem, he tries to see if he can tell me how to fix it (good to
be educated), or if he can fix it remotely (and therefore, reduce
the amount of time I need to be off my computer)

2. He is interested in empowering his clients to do what they can
by themselves.

3. He sets up systems (backup, spyware removal, etc) that keep my
computers functioning optimally

 
I recommend him highly!

What do others do about backing up the data they have on their home 
computer? The most important thing to me are the pictures I have. 
Now that I only take digital pictures, what if I lost them all? I 
do have them backed up onto a external HD, and some are on CD, and 
a selection are uploaded to a share site so I guess I'd still have 
access to some of them there. But I'm worried about hard drive 
failure or my computer or backup HD being stolen. (There have been 
breakins in our neighborhood, we have been lucky.) What are others 
doing? Are there good online backup sites? I have 20+ GBs worth...
a little worried
</i>
<hr>
I don't know if this is the perfect solution, but it works for
me so far: Once a month (I make a note on my calendar), I back
up all my ''My Documents'' files (I don't worry about software,
just the content) onto a 250GB external USB hard drive (less
than $100) and walk it down to our safe deposit box, and at the
same time pick up my second external drive from the box for the
next month's backup, just swapping them in and out. The one
that's at home could still get stolen, but at least I have a
copy of everything relatively safe from fire/theft at all
times.  I also periodically burn CDs of photos to store at home
or in the safe deposit box.

Backup, backup, backup. And backup again! I keep at least triple
backups of all of my data. I have over 600 GBs of photography work
and 700 GBs of music. I backup all the time and keep several off
site. I've spent too much time ripping music and my photography
work is too important to me to lose any of it.
<p>
If you have a Mac you can use Carbon Copy to back either entire
drives or specific content. 1 TBs drives are priced reasonably
these days.

I buy most of my drives from OWC.

Backup often and have more than one backup! Keep one at work or at
a friends house.

<hr>
I use an online backup program called SugarSync, available at
https://www.sugarsync.com/  I pay about $50 per year for 30 Gb
of storage.  Whenever you add a file or change a file on your
computer, it automatically uploads to the online website
(password protected and secure).  It also saves the last five
versions of everything so if you make a mistake, you can go
back to a previous version.  You can turn it off when you need
bandwidth for other things, like streaming video, etc.  There
are different plans with different storage maximums.  You can
try it free for a month too.  You can also share files with
others easily and share photo albums, and sync files from
differnt computers.  I love the piece of mind knowing that all
my files are online in case my house burns down or everything
is stolen.  I can access all my files from any computer hooked
up to the internet too, which is very handy.  I am VERY happy
with this service.

<hr>
When thinking about backing up data, the rule of thumb is that
data must exist on two completely different 'things'.  that can
be an external hard drive, CDs, another computer, etc.  Hard
drives fail often and data can usually be restored but you
don't want that kind of worry.
<p>
The other rule is that if you are protecting the data from
theft or damage like fire/water, you will need to have the data
in two different physical locations.  I am now a fan of going
with an online storage/backup service.  You can either use
something like a photo sharing service or get a service that
stores yours files for you.  I would recommend getting a large
external hard drive and synching it to a hosted site--that
would be your belt with a pair of suspenders......

<hr>
You should check out either www.mozy.com or www.BackBlaze.com. For about $5 per
month you can back up your entire hard-drive to Internet based storage.

Mozy asks you to define what you want to back up. BackBlaze backs up everything by
default. I prefer latter but it's a matter of opinion really. What I love most: both 
support
both Mac and PCs.
Nik

<hr>
I back up my computer on Mozey.com (I think that's what it
is...I'm out of town right now and using another computer).
It's about $10.00 per month. It automatically backs up
everything daily. There are many sites like this.
It also backs up  my pics, BUT I also put all of my pics into a
Kodak site. That way I can send them to other people without
taking up too much of their computer space) and they/I can
order prints etc.
<p>
Hope this helps. It's important to have some kind of back up.
Good you are doing this now.

<hr>
Mozy.com
$5 per month - we use it - it's great. YOu can schedule it on
your computer so you don't have to remember to back it up
yourself. And it's offsite.


<hr>
When searching for an online site, I would recommend to use one
that functions as a storage database so you can get your
originals back, rather than a photo-sharing site like Snapfish.
 Flikr will allow you to upload pictures and retrieve your
originals.  You can get a small monthly allotment for free (100MB
I think), but to upload more than that you pay a monthly fee.  I
also back up my pictures onto DVDs and put it in a bank safety
deposit box.  That way if there is a fire, flood, etc. in the
house, all my backup won't be in one place.  Good luck!
Stacy D.

<hr>
Here's what I do for backups:
<p>
I have two small USB disk drives (I like the little Western
Digital Passport -- tiny, and about $100 from Amazon for 500 GB;
only $75 if 250GB will do).  I format the whole partition with
TrueCrypt (www.truecrypt.org) -- free and very secure, so if the
drive is lost or stolen I don't worry.
<p>
I keep one at home, and one in my safe deposit box at the bank.
I use the one at home to back up every few days (incremental
backup, so it takes very little time).  I store the drive AWAY
from the computer, so if it's stolen they won't think to take the
backup drive.  About every three months, I swap the home drive
with its twin at the bank, so I have one that's no more than a
couple months old totally safe even if my house burns down.
<p>
There are various ''cloud storage'' options these days, but I
haven't used them and don't know how to evaluate their security
or permanence (what if the company goes out of business? or an
irate employee erases everything? etc.).
--Careful about backups

<hr>
I use an online service called Mozy that backs up everything
automatically.  It's affordable and gives me peace of mind.  The
website it mozy.com/home
<hr>
Yes, you should definitely back up your photos (though it sounds
like a lot of yours are already sort of backed up).  Don't do
what I did.  My hard disk died a couple of years ago.  I had
years and years of photos on it, never backed up.  Sometimes you
can recover data from a failed hard drive yourself, using
software, but mine was beyond that.  I ended up paying $2,000 to
have an organization in Novato recover all my data.  Ouch!  Since
then, I back up regularly.  The easiest way is using an online
backup service. You might want to take a look at Carbonite
(www.carbonite.com).  It's very easy to set up and use.  The
first 15 days are free, so you can see if you like it.  It costs
about $60 a year to keep it going.  Another, cheaper,
alternative, if you have a DVD burner, is to burn all of your
photos to DVD now and then.  If photos are mostly what you're
concerned about, online backup might be overkill.  The
disadvantage of the DVD solution is that you actually have to do
it!  Carbonite is automatic.  If you don't have a DVD burner, how
about just copying all of your photos to an online photo site?

I  just love my new backup software/website.  It was recommended by the 
tech Q&A guy in the SF Chronicle.  It's at www.sugarsync.com  You 
download their program to your computer.  You tell the program which 
files to back up and then it backs up all the files online to 
sugarsync's website.  The great thing is, everytime you add a new photo 
or song or file to your computer, or save a new version of a document, 
it automatically backs it up to sugarsync.  This way, you always have a 
100% current back up online should there be an earthquake or your house 
burns down.  You can access your files (securely) using any computer 
with internet access, which is very handy.  You can also share your 
photos online with people through sugarsync's website, and you can 
share large files or folders with others if you choose to.  I bought 30 
Gb of storage for $50/year.  I think it's a bargain for the piece of 
mind. They have different packages depending on how much storage you 
need. You can do a!
  free trial if you'dike to check it out (30 days?).  It's also very 
easy to use, and quick to set up.
Andi

<hr>
I'm not expert, but on the suggestion of the Chronicle's computer 
columnist, I started backing up my PC files online at idrive.com.  You 
set up when, how often, and what you want backed up, and then it runs 
automatically (your computer has to be on, but you don't need to be 
signed on).
<p>
Their basic program is free, but will only back up 2 GB.  That's what I 
use, but I don't have it back up everything - especially photos, since 
they take so much space.  They also offer $50/year for 150 GB.
<p>
For photos, as soon as I put them on my computer, I try to remember to 
upload them to two different online photo sites (I use Shutterfly and 
Koday Gallery) - in case one of them goes belly-up - so I don't have to 
use a ton of CDs.  Not as convenient, but I don't have to do it often.
R.K.

<hr>
There are two main options for computer backup, online and external 
hardware, each has advantages.
<p>
You can use an online service like http://mozy.com and get 2GB of 
storage for free or they have paid plans that accommodate more space. 
You set the computer to backup at a certain time and day and it takes 
care of the rest.  The disadvantage is the data is stored elsewhere and 
may not be immediately accessible.  If you have a catastrophic failure, 
you're going to have to know how to access the data from another 
computer for retrieval.
<p>
Personally, I use an external hard-drive that backs up all my important 
data daily without intervention.  Most external drives will come with 
some type of software which will allow you to accomplish this in very 
easy fashion.  For less than, $100 you should be able to find an 
external hard-drive to accommodate most needs.  Your photos will take 
up the most space.  I recently purchases a 1 terabyte drive for about 
$200 which should be more than enough for quite some time.
<p>
The downsides to the external hard-drive would be the potential for 
theft, damage (such as fire/flood) and cost. They will also wear out 
eventually since they are mechanical.
<p>
Eventually I will probably move to a dual external hard-drive 
configuration where one gets saved in a fire resistant safe.
<p>
Hope this helps!

<p>
1. Domain name - I do understand how to buy one. Is there a 
reason not to use GoDaddy?
<p>
2. If you have a domain name who hosts you -- or is that even 
the right terminology? If I want JaneSmith.com who does someone 
send email to -- is it Jane@JaneSmith.com? But then who do I 
get my email from? Is that the same as whomever provides my DSL

<p>
3. What are the advantages or disadvantages of having these 
services bundled or not from a single provider? Recommended

4. I want my email to download to my computer not just exist on

As a web designer, I get these types of questions a lot from my clients.  Here are the basics:  
You buy hosting from a hosting company - there are a million of them out there.  Most hosting 
companies (GoDaddy included, since you mentioned them) also do domain registration, often as 
part of the hosting package, and it usually makes sense (convenient and cheap) to do both 
through the same company. 
Whatever hosting package you choose should come with email accounts that you set up with 
whatever name(s) you want - Jane[at]JaneSmith.com, etc.  You generally check this email online.  
There are ways to hook it up to your Outlook, etc. box, but I've never done that.
<p>
Make sure that whatever host/package you choose provides the tools you need - if you plan to use 
Front Page, ASP, FTP access, etc., check that those features are included/supported.  If you're 
working with a web designer, ask them what they need.
<p>
In my experience, the smaller hosting companies (my current fav is 1and1.com) are better than 
the big providers (Yahoo, Verio, SBC, etc.) when it comes to customer service, features and 
price.  There are a bunch of sites out there that rate and compare various hosts - 
www.hostsearch.com, www.hostcompare.com, etc.  Or ask around and see what other people like
jpp
<hr>
You have asked very good questions. I would go for bundled services - one host with web, email 
and other functionalities all provided. It's more convenient for you service-wise and more cost 
effective. My company offers full webcenter services with complete email package so that you can 
access email accounts directly through such favored Pop3 email clients as Outlook, Thunderbird

<h4><a name=full>Computer Hard Drive Full!</a>

My problem is 
that I have two local disks (C and D; the floppy, and CD drives 
are A, F and G respectively).  Drive C is 16 GB but only has 
500 MB available.  Drive D is 58 GB and is essentially empty 
although I have moved all of my personal files and pictures 
onto the D drive.  It appears that the C drive is full of 
programs (including ITunes).  Is it possible to move some of 
the programs from the C to D drive or do I need to uninstall 
and reinstall on the D drive?  Is this DYI project or do I need 
to call in the professional?  Any websites that might address 
issues like this?  Thanks!
Cindy 
</i>
<hr>
To answer your main question, about moving software from your C to your D drive, 
unfortunately, the only surefire way to do this is to uninstall the software and 
reinstall it on D.  If you've got the original CDs for the software (or downloaded 
copies, or in the case of software like iTunes, access to the WEB site), you can 
certainly do this yourself.  The tricky part will be moving all of your associated 
data over to D.  It's not that hard if you're pretty comfortable in general with 
moving files around.  After you uninstall software, those data files are left around.  
Unfortunately, they can sometimes be hard to find.  For instance, Microsoft tends to 
place your data in some obscure folder that's shared by lots of other software.  If 
you were to uninstall Outlook, for instance and reinstall it on D, when you ran the 
newly installed program, you wouldn't see any of your data (e-mails, contacts, 
calendar) until you found your old data and either moved it or told Outlook where to 
find it.  
A bit tricky, but it completely depends on which software you're moving.
<p>
All that said, if you can afford to, I'd recommend a different fix.  A larger C drive 
would be a much better solution.  You could even get a used one, cheaply.  There are 
lots of things that just have to be on C, so you're likely to run into this pretty 
constantly.  Copying the contents of your old C drive to a new one can be done without 
reinstalling everything, but you'd want to hire a pro to do it.
Patty

<hr>
It is possible to uninstall programs from your C drive and re-install them on your D 
drive, but that's kind of tedious. The simplest solution  is probably buying a new 
hard drive and using it as a replacement for your C: drive. Hard drives are so 
inexpensive now that it will cost less than $100. Maxtor hard drives come with 
instructions and software to help you copy the contents of an old drive to a new 
drive. (Other manufacturers probably have the same thing, but I've done this with a 
Maxtor drive). Whether you can do it yourself depends upon how comfortable you are 
with opening up your computer and removing components. It is a process intended for 
consumers to complete, but you have to be comfortable at installing/uninstalling and 
connecting/disconnecting your hard drives. If you're not, BestBuy (for instance) 
advertises they will installl a hard drive for $39. Finally, there are a lot of 
different acronyms associated with hard drives and you need to make sure to get one 
that is compatible with your computer. If it currently has only a 16GB drive then it's 
probably pretty old, maybe mid to late 90s? It might be time to consider upgrading to 
a new computer to solve your hard disk limitations.
Upgrading all of the Time

<hr>
You could temporarily transfer all your documents (photos, etc.) to an external hard 
drive (HD) or burned on DVD, then reinstall your operating system (OS) and all 
programs on the large HD (58GB), then transfer all your docs back to the 16GB HD.
Another way of doing it is getting a larger HD, say 150 GB, setting that up as your 
storage HD, then transfering all contents of your 16GB to it and converting the 58GB 
as your OS HD, for programs only.
The reasoning is that you will accumulate docs more quickly than programs, so you will 
need more storage space eventually.  And 16GB is small for an OS HD; they work faster 
when there is empty space, at least twice as much as taken space.
And your 16GB could remain a back up HD, a MP3 HD or an external HD.

<h4>Upgrading a Computer Yourself

I'm needing to upgrade my IBM-compatible PC (memory and hard drive). Any 
good suggestions about
where I could have this done in the East Bay?
<hr>
Tim<br>
The cheapest way is to do it yourself. Neither installing more memory nor
a new hard drive is beyond the abilities of anyone who can turn a
screwdriver and plug in a lamp. Get a copy of a book like Upgrading and
Repairing PC's (Pub. QUE, any recent edition will do) at the library if
you're nervous. Ask a computer literate friend to help. At $50/hr. and up,
you'll save some money.
<p>
If you still want to find a shop to do it, the folks at PC Ten (on Solano
in Albany, and Piedmont in Oakland) are reliable. 5271388/6525268. Or any
small computer shop -- take a look in Computer Currents for lots of
listings.

<hr>

Putting in new memory is a snap. It is as easy as inserting new batteries 
into a flashlight.
Read in your literature that came with the machine to see if you can find 
the kind of
memory required for the machine and then go to a catalog and order it. Make 
sure
they send instructions. Changing the hard drive is a little bit more 
difficult, more screws
  to unfasten and to remember where to replace, but is like putting in a 
new can of oil into
  your car engine. If you can be assured that it is easy and that you can 
do it, you will save
a bundle of money. You can order a hard drive directly from IBM or you can 
try Le Cie.
Their web page addresses are obvious. Also, to get more experience you 
could sign up for
an adult school class dealing in sevicing your computer. I did not go to a 
class, but I changed
my own hard drive from a 2 gig to a 9 gig and doubled my memory on my own, 
no instruction.

I want to have  access to my computer network from the downstairs living room.  
The computer room is just almost above the living room, upstairs.  I think we could 
get a very long network wire and string it inside the wall so it isn't visible. We 
need to be concerned about a fireblock in the wall because this wall is very tall, 
so we might have to poke a hole through the wall and drill a little hole in the fireblock
so the wire can pass through and down to the bottom of the wall.  But, then we have 
to be concerned about patching up the hole.  Does anyone have suggestions to make
this procedure as painless as possible?  Maybe you can recommend a handy person
to do this?
Hana 
<hr>
A handyman who did something like this for us a long time ago use a VERY
long drill bit (5 feet?) to get through the fireblock from the top the
the wall in the attic.

You might also consider various wireless networking stuff, there are
Airports for Macs, and for PCs there are wireless options and there are
products that communicate through the power wiring in your home.  For
200-500 bucks you can get a complete setup, that's probably as much as
you'd pay a handyman to make all these holes and patch them.

We have an Apple Airport hub that we got just for this
purpose. It is meant for Macs but we adapted for use on our PCs (you can find instructions
on the web but you will need a little technical expertise).

<h4><a name=water>Water Spilled on Laptop Computer</a>

Hi, my husband brought me water last nite when I was working on 
our new Dell laptop and he spilled water on the keyboard. I 
immediately wiped the water off but within a few minutes the 
computer just blew off and shut down. It would not turn on 
again. We didn't get the accident insurance and we know the 
warranty won't cover the damage. Any advice? Are you a techie 
or have a techie partner that might have some feedback? Nancy
</i>
<hr>
I'm not a techie, but my husband is. In any case, you probably
shorted your motherboard. There's nothing you can do, other than
replacing it. I had the same thing happen to me with my
(company-supplied) ThinkPad. 
<p>
I don't know Dell's arrangements, but even though I recovered
most of the data on my hard drive before sending the laptop to
IBM for repair, I was pleasantly pleased to find out that all the
data was still on the machine after the repair. I believe they
just swapped out the motherboard.
<p>
I doubt it's covered under warranty, but I also doubt that it
will be a huge fee. I think our repair was in the neighborhood of
$40; the computer was also returned in a week.
<p>
It has been my experience, however, that you can't always count
on having your data on a computer after a repair. Often machines
are ''wiped'' clean when during the repair.
<p>
What you may want to do before you send it in for repair is
purchase a ''shell'' ($15 to $50 at Fry's or similar stores) and
get some somewhat savvy person to remove your hard drive and
place it in the shell, connected to a working computer through a
USB port (it's best if you have the same operating systems). You
may be able to recover the data on your hard drive. If you can't
see any of your files, try Googling for free- or shareware
data-recovery programs.

Good luck.
