<div align="justify">
      <p>This page is meant to serve as a guide to the vast
      quantity of computer terms and acronyms in common use for the
      casual computer user. It is divided into two main sections,
      the <a href="#basic">first</a> is dedicated to the basics and
      is meant more for beginners, while the <a href="#reference">second</a> is meant instead to be used as a
      reference. In reality many of the terms in the second section
      are still quite common; the first section was deliberately
      kept as short as possible.</p>

      <p>Terms in the second section may be looked up by either
      using the &quot;find in page&quot; function of your <a href="/Computer/Terms/browser/view">browser</a>, or by
      appending &quot;<em>#term</em>&quot; (without the quotes and where
      <em>term</em> is the term of interest) to the &quot;<a href="/Computer/Terms/URLa/view">URL</a>&quot; or &quot;go
      to&quot; section of your browser, keeping in mind that case
      matters. The best method of searching for a term though is
      to use the <a href="/Computer/Search/" onmouseover="window.status='Search computer knowledgebase...';return true" onmouseout="window.status='Saugus.net';return true">Search
      Interface</a> that will return not only the specific term
      sought but also other entries that reference it. Be aware
      that the terms referenced in the second part of this page
      will freely assume familiarity with the first part.</p>

      <p>If you are instead actually trying to figure out what a
      particular <a href="/Computer/Terms/extension/view">filename extension</a>
      means, you might instead try the <a href="/Computer/Extensions/">filename extensions page</a>.</p>

      <p>If you want something added or see a problem with
      something already here (but keep in mind this guide is not
      meant to be overly technical) please send <script type="text/javascript">document.write('<a href="&#109;&#97;&#1'+'05;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#'+'58;&#119;&#101;&#98;&#1'+'09;&#97;&#115;&#116;&#1'+'01;&#114;&#64;&#115;&#9'+'7;&#117;&#103;&#117;&#1'+'15;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#1'+'16;&#63;&#115;&#117;&#9'+'8;&#106;&#101;&#99;&#11'+'6;&#61;&#67;&#111;&#109'+';&#112;&#117;&#116;&#10'+'1;&#114;&#84;&#101;&#11'+'4;&#109;&#115;" title="'+'&#67;&#111;&#109;&#112;'+'&#117;&#116;&#101;&#114'+';&#84;&#101;&#114;&#109'+';&#115;">&#101;&#45;&#1'+'09;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#3'+'2;&#116;&#111;&#32;&#11'+'6;&#104;&#101;&#32;&#11'+'9;&#101;&#98;&#109;&#97'+';&#115;&#116;&#101;&#11'+'4;</a>');</script>.</p>

<dt>
        <strong>application</strong>  &amp;  <strong>app</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  An application (often called &quot;app&quot; for short) is simply a <a href="/Computer/Terms/program/view">program</a> with a <a href="/Computer/Terms/GUI/view">GUI</a>. Note that it is  different from an <a href="/Computer/Terms/applet/view">applet</a>.
    </dd>

        <a name="boot" id="boot"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>boot</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Starting up an <a href="/Computer/Terms/OS/view">OS</a> is booting it. If the
  computer is already running, it is more often called
  rebooting.
    </dd>

        <a name="browser" id="browser"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>browser</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A browser is a <a href="/Computer/Terms/program/view">program</a> used to
  browse the <a href="/Computer/Terms/WWW/view">web</a>. Some common browsers
  include <a href="/Computer/FreeSoftware/Netscape/view">Netscape<a>,
  <a href="/Computer/FreeSoftware/MSIE/view"><acronym

    </dd>

        <a name="bug" id="bug"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>bug</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A bug is a mistake in the design of something, especially
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/software/view">software</a>. A really severe bug can
  cause something to <a href="/Computer/Terms/crash/view">crash</a>.
    </dd>

        <a name="chat" id="chat"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>chat</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Chatting is like <a href="/Computer/Terms/e-mail/view">e-mail</a>, only it is
  done instantaneously and can directly involve multiple
  people at once. While e-mail now relies on one more or
  less standard <a href="/Computer/Terms/protocol/view">protocol</a>, chatting
  still has a couple competing ones. Of particular note are
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/IRC/view">IRC</a> and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/IM/view">Instant Messenger</a>. One step
  beyond chatting is called <a href="/Computer/Terms/MUD/view">MUDding</a>.
    </dd>

        <a name="click" id="click"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>click</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  To press a <a href="/Computer/Terms/mouse/view">mouse</a> button. When done
  twice in rapid succession, it is referred to as a
  double-click.
    </dd>

        <a name="cursor" id="cursor"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>cursor</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A point of attention on the computer screen, often marked
  with a flashing line or block. Text typed into the
  computer will usually appear at the cursor.
    </dd>

        <a name="database" id="database"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>database</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A database is a collection of data, typically organized
  to make common retrievals easy and efficient. Some common
  database programs include Oracle, Sybase,
  <a href="/Computer/FreeSoftware/PostgreSQL/view">Postgres</a>,
  Informix, Filemaker, Adabas, etc.
    </dd>

        <a name="desktop" id="desktop"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>desktop</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A desktop system is a computer designed to sit in one
  position on a desk somewhere and not move around. Most
  general purpose computers are desktop systems. Calling a
  system a desktop implies nothing about its platform. The
  fastest desktop system at any given time is typically
  either an <a href="/Computer/Terms/Alpha/view">Alpha</a> or
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/PowerPC/view">PowerPC</a> based system, but the
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/SPARC/view">SPARC</a> and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/PA-RISC/view">PA-RISC</a>
  based systems are also often in the running. Industrial
  strength desktops are typically called
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/workstation/view">workstations</a>.
    </dd>

        <a name="directory" id="directory"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>directory</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Also called &quot;folder&quot;, a directory is a collection of
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/file/view">files</a> typically created for
  organizational purposes. Note that a directory is itself
  a file, so a directory can generally contain other
  directories. It differs in this way from a
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/partition/view">partition</a>.
    </dd>

        <a name="disk" id="disk"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>disk</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A disk is a physical object used for storing data. It
  will not forget its data when it loses power. It is
  always used in conjunction with a <a href="/Computer/Terms/drive/view">disk
  drive</a>. Some disks can be removed from their drives,
  some cannot. Generally it is possible to write new
  information to a disk in addition to reading data from
  it, but this is not always the case.
    </dd>

        <a name="drive" id="drive"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>drive</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A device for storing and/or retrieving data. Some drives
  (such as disk drives, zip drives, and tape drives) are
  typically capable of having new data written to them, but
  some others (like CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs) are not. Some
  drives have <a href="/Computer/Terms/randomaccess/view">random access</a>
  (like disk drives, zip drives, CD-ROMs, and DVD-ROMs),
  while others only have
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/sequentialaccess/view">sequential access</a>
  (like tape drives).
    </dd>

        <a name="e-book" id="e-book"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>e-book</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  The concept behind an e-book is that it should provide all
  the functionality of an ordinary book but in a manner
  that is (overall) less expensive and more environmentally
  friendly. The actual term e-book is somewhat confusingly
  used to refer to a variety of things: custom
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/software/view">software</a> to play e-book titles, dedicated
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/hardware/view">hardware</a> to play e-book titles,
  and the e-book titles themselves. Individual e-book titles
  can be free or commercial (but will always be less
  expensive than their printed counterparts) and have to be
  loaded into a player to be read. Players vary wildly in
  capability level. Basic ones allow simple reading and
  bookmarking; better ones include various features like
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/hypertext/view">hypertext</a>, illustrations, audio,
  and even limited video. Other optional features allow the
  user to mark-up sections of text, leave notes, circle or
  diagram things, highlight passages, program or customize
  settings, and even use <a href="/Computer/Terms/IF/view">interactive
  fiction</a>. There are many types of e-book; a couple
  popular ones include the <a href="/Computer/Terms/Newtonbook/view">Newton
  book</a> and <a href="/Computer/Terms/PalmDOC/view">Palm DOC</a>.
    </dd>

        <a name="e-mail" id="e-mail"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>e-mail</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  E-mail is short for electronic mail. It allows for the
  transfer of information from one computer to another,
  provided that they are hooked up via some sort of
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/network/view">network</a> (often the
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Internet/view">Internet</a>. E-mail works similarly to
  FAXing, but its contents typically get printed out on the
  other end only on demand, not immediately and
  automatically as with FAX. A machine receiving e-mail
  will also not reject other incoming mail messages as a
  busy FAX machine will; rather they will instead be
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/queue/view">queued</a> up to be received after the
  current batch has been completed. E-mail is only seven-<a
  href="/Computer/Terms/bit/view">bit</a> clean, meaning that you should not
  expect anything other than <a href="/Computer/Terms/ASCII/view">ASCII</a>
  data to go through uncorrupted without prior conversion
  via something like <a href="/Computer/Terms/uucode/view">uucode</a> or
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/bcode/view">bcode</a>. Some mailers will do some
  conversion automatically, but unless you know your mailer
  is one of them, you may want to do the encoding manually.
    </dd>

        <a name="file" id="file"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>file</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A file is a unit of (usually named) information stored on a computer.
    </dd>

        <a name="firmware" id="firmware"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>firmware</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Sort of in-between <a href="/Computer/Terms/hardware/view">hardware</a> and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/software/view">software</a>, firmware consists of
  modifiable <a href="/Computer/Terms/program/view">programs</a>
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/embedded/view">embedded</a> in hardware.  Firmware
  updates should be treated with care since they can literally
  destroy the underlying hardare if done improperly.  There are
  also cases where neglecting to apply a firmware update can
  destroy the underlying hardware, so <a href="/Computer/Terms/user/view">user</a>
  beware.
    </dd>

        <a name="floppy" id="floppy"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>floppy</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  An extremely common type of removable
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/disk/view">disk</a>. Floppies do not hold too
  much data, but most computers are capable of reading them. Note though
  that there are different competing
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/format/view">format</a> used for floppies,
  so that a floppy written by one type of computer might not directly work
  on another. Also sometimes called &quot;diskette&quot;.
    </dd>

        <a name="format" id="format"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>format</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  The manner in which data is stored; its organization. For
  example, <acronym title="Video Home System">VHS</acronym>,
  <acronym title="Super Video Home System">SVHS</acronym>,
  and Beta are three different formats
  of video tape. They are not 100% compatible with each
  other, but information can be transferred from one to the
  other with the proper equipment (but not always without
  loss; SVHS contains more information than either of the
  other two). Computer information can be stored in
  literally hundreds of different formats, and can
  represent text, sounds, <a href="/Computer/Terms/graphics/view">graphics</a>,
  animations, etc. Computer information can be exchanged
  via different computer types provided both computers can
  interpret the format used.
    </dd>

        <a name="function_keys" id="function_keys"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>function keys</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  On a computer <a href="/Computer/Terms/keyboard/view">keyboard</a>, the keys
  that start with an &quot;F&quot; that are usually (but not always)
  found on the top row. They are meant to perform
  user-defined tasks.
    </dd>

        <a name="graphics" id="graphics"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>graphics</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Anything visually displayed on a computer that is not text.
    </dd>

        <a name="hardware" id="hardware"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>hardware</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  The physical portion of the computer.
    </dd>

        <a name="hypertext" id="hypertext"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>hypertext</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A hypertext document is like a text document with the
  ability to contain pointers to other regions of (possibly
  other) hypertext documents.
    </dd>

        <a name="Internet" id="Internet"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>Internet</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  The Internet is the world-wide
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/network/view">network</a> of computers. There is only one
  Internet, and thus it is typically capitalized (although
  it is sometimes referred to as &quot;the 'net&quot;). It is
  different from an intranet.
    </dd>

        <a name="keyboard" id="keyboard"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>keyboard</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A keyboard on a computer is almost identical to a
  keyboard on a typewriter. Computer keyboards will
  typically have extra keys, however. Some of these keys
  (common examples include Control, Alt, and Meta) are
  meant to be used in conjunction with other keys just like
  shift on a regular typewriter. Other keys (common
  examples include Insert, Delete, Home, End, Help,
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/functionkeys/view">function keys</a>,etc.) are meant
  to be used independently and often perform editing tasks.
  Keyboards on different <a href="/Computer/Terms/platform/view">platforms</a>
  will often look slightly different and have somewhat
  different collections of keys. Some keyboards even have
  independent shift lock and caps lock keys. Smaller
  keyboards with only math-related keys are typically
  called &quot;keypads&quot;.
    </dd>

        <a name="language" id="language"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>language</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Computer <a href="/Computer/Terms/program/view">programs</a> can
  be written in a variety of different languages. Different languages
  are optimized for different tasks. Common languages
  include <a href="/Computer/Terms/Java/view">Java</a>,
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/C/view">C</a>,
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/CPlusPlus/view">C++</a>,
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/ForTran/view">ForTran</a>,
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Pascal/view">Pascal</a>,
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Lisp/view">Lisp</a>, and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/BASIC/view">BASIC</a>. Some people
  classify languages into two categories, higher-level and
  lower-level. These people would consider
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/assemblylanguage/view">assembly language</a> and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/machinelanguage/view">machine language</a>
  lower-level languages and all other languages higher-level. In
  general, higher-level languages can be either
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/interpreted/view">interpreted</a> or
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/compiled/view">compiled</a>; many
  languages allow both, but some are restricted to one or the other. Many
  people do not consider machine language and assembly language at
  all when talking about programming languages.
    </dd>

        <a name="laptop" id="laptop"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>laptop</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  A laptop is any computer designed to do pretty much
  anything a <a href="/Computer/Terms/desktop/view">desktop</a> system
  can do but run for a short time (usually two to five hours) on
  batteries. They are designed to be carried around but are
  not particularly convenient to carry around. They are
  significantly more expensive than desktop systems and
  have far worse battery life than <a href="/Computer/Terms/PDA/view">PDAs</a>.
  Calling a system a laptop implies nothing about its
  platform. By far the fastest laptops are the
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/PowerPC/view">PowerPC</a> based
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Mac/view">Macintoshes</a>.

        <a name="memory" id="memory"></a>
<dt>
        <strong>memory</strong>  </dt>
<dd>
  Computer memory is used to temporarily store data. In
  reality, computer memory is only capable of remembering
  sequences of zeros and ones, but by utilizing the
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/binary/view">binary</a> number system it is possible to
  produce arbitrary rational numbers and through clever
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/format/view">formatting</a> all manner of
  representations of pictures, sounds, and animations. The
  most common types of memory are <a href="/Computer/Terms/RAM/view">RAM</a>,

  One megahertz is equivalent to 1000 <a href="/Computer/Terms/kHz/view">kilohertz</a>, or 1,000,000 <a href="/Computer/Terms/Hz/view">hertz</a>.  The clock speed of the main <a href="/Computer/Terms/processor/view">processor</a> of many computers is measured in MHz, and is sometimes (quite misleadingly) used to represent the overall speed of a computer.  In fact, a computer's speed is based upon many factors, and since MHz only reveals how many clock cycles the main processor has per second (saying nothing about how much is actually accomplished per cycle), it can really only accurately be used to gauge two computers with the same generation and family of processor plus similar configurations of memory, co-processors, and other peripheral hardware.

<dd>
  The ASCII <a href="/Computer/Terms/characterset/view">character set</a> is
  the most popular one in common use. People will often
  refer to a bare text file without complicated embedded
  format instructions as an ASCII file, and such files can
  usually be transferred from one computer system to
  another with relative ease. Unfortunately there are a few
  minor variations of it that pop up here and there, and if
  you receive a text file that seems subtly messed up with
  punctuation marks altered or upper and lower case
  reversed, you are probably encountering one of the ASCII
  variants. It is usually fairly straightforward to
  translate from one ASCII variant to another, though. The
  ASCII character set is seven <a href="/Computer/Terms/bit/view">bit</a> while
  pure <a href="/Computer/Terms/binary/view">binary</a> is usually eight bit,
  so transferring a binary file through ASCII channels will
  result in corruption and loss of data. Note also that the
  ASCII character set is a subset of the
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Unicode/view">Unicode</a> character set.

<dd>
  There are two meanings for binary in common computer
  usage. The first is the name of the number system in
  which there are only zeros and ones. This is important to
  computers because all computer data is ultimately a
  series of zeros and ones, and thus can be represented by
  binary numbers. The second is an offshoot of the first;
  data that is not meant to be intepreted through a common
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/characterset/view">character set</a> (like
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/ASCII/view">ASCII</a>) is typically
  referred to as binary data. Pure binary data is typically eight
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/bit/view">bit</a> data, and transferring
  a binary file through ASCII channels without prior modification will
  result in corruption and loss of data. Binary data can be
  turned into ASCII data via <a href="/Computer/Terms/uucode/view">uucoding</a>
  or <a href="/Computer/Terms/bcode/view">bcoding</a>.

  A bit can either be on or off; one or zero. All computer
  data can ultimately be reduced to a series of bits. The
  term is also used as a (very rough) measure of sound
  quality, color quality, and even
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/processor/view">procesor</a> capability by
  considering the fact that series of bits can represent binary numbers.
  For example (without getting too technical), an eight bit
  image can contain at most 256 distinct colors while a

  colors.

  Boolean algebra is the mathematics of base two numbers.
  Since base two numbers have only two values, zero and
  one, there is a good analogy between base two numbers and
  the logical values &quot;true&quot; &amp; &quot;false&quot;. In
  common usage, booleans are therefore considered to be simple
  logical values like true &amp; false and the operations that
  relate them, most typically &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and
  &quot;not&quot;. Since everyone has a basic understanding of the

  A byte is a grouping of <a href="/Computer/Terms/bit/view">bits</a>. It is

  non-standard byte sizes. Bytes are usually measured in
  large groups, and the term &quot;kilobyte&quot; (often abbreviated
  as K) means one-thousand twenty-four (1024) bytes; the
  term &quot;megabyte&quot; (often abbreviated as M) means
  one-thousand twenty-four (1024) K; the term gigabyte
  (often abbreviated as G) means one-thousand twenty-four
  (1024) M; and the term &quot;terabyte&quot; (often abbreviated
  as T) means one-thousand twenty-four (1024) G.
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/memory/view">Memory</a> is typically

  While the specifics are well beyond the scope of this

  philosophy of <a href="/Computer/Terms/software/view">software</a> creation.
  Often this philosophy is referred to as object-oriented
  design (sometimes abbreviated as OOD), and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/program/view">programs</a> written with it in mind are
  referred to as object-oriented programs (often
  abbreviated OOP). Programming
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/language/view">languages</a> designed to help
  facilitate it are called object-oriented languages (sometimes
  abbreviated as OOL) and <a href="/Computer/Terms/database/view">databases</a>
  built with it in mind are called object-oriented
  databases (sometimes abbreviated as OODB or less
  fortunately OOD). The general notion is that an
  object-oriented approach to creating software starts with
  modeling the real-world problems trying to be solved in
  familiar real-world ways, and carries the analogy all the
  way down to structure of the program. This is of course a
  great over-simplification. Numerous object-oriented
  programming languages exist including:

  UNIX is a family of <a href="/Computer/Terms/OS/view">OSes</a>,
  each being made by a different company or organization but all
  offering a very similar look and feel. It can not quite
  be considered non-<a href="/Computer/Terms/proprietary/view">proprietary</a>,
  however, as the differences between different vendor's
  versions can be significant (it is still generally
  possible to switch from one vendor's UNIX to another
  without too much effort; today the differences between
  different UNIXes are similar to the differences between
  the different <a href="/Computer/Terms/MS-Windows/view">MS-Windows</a>;
  historically there were two different UNIX camps,
  Berkeley / BSD and AT&amp;T / System V, but the assorted
  vendors have worked together to minimalize the
  differences). The free variant <a href="/Computer/Terms/Linux/view">Linux</a>
  is one of the closest things to a current,
  non-proprietary OS; its development is controlled by a
  non-profit organization and its distribution is provided
  by several companies. UNIX is powerful; it is fully
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/multitasking/view">multitasking</a> and
  can do pretty much anything that any OS can do (look to the
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Hurd/view">Hurd</a> if you need a more powerful
  OS). With power comes complexity, however, and UNIX tends not to be
  overly friendly to beginners (although those who think
  UNIX is difficult or cryptic apparently have not used
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/CPM/view">CP/M</a>).
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/windowmanager/view">Window
  managers</a> are available for UNIX (running under
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/X/view">X-Windows</a>) and once properly
  configured common operations will be almost as simple on
  a UNIX machine as on a <a href="/Computer/Terms/Mac/view">Mac</a>. Out of all

  hardware support. It will <a href="/Computer/Terms/run/view">run</a> on
  machines built around many different
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/processor/view">processors</a>.
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/lightweight/view">Lightweight</a> versions of

  and in the other direction, full featured versions make full advantage of

  The general class of problems resulting from the wrapping
  of computers' internal date timers is given this label in
  honor of the most obvious occurrence -- when the year
  changes from 1999 to 2000 (abbreviated in some
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/program/view">programs</a> as 99 to 00 indicating a
  backwards time movement). Contrary to popular belief,
  these problems will not all manifest themselves on the
  first day of 2000, but will in fact happen over a range
  of dates extending out beyond 2075. A computer that does
  not have problems prior to the beginning of 2001 is
  considered &quot;Y2K compliant&quot;, and a computer that does not
  have problems within the next ten years or so is
  considered for all practical purposes to be &quot;Y2K clean&quot;.
  Whether or not a given computer is &quot;clean&quot; depends upon
  both its <a href="/Computer/Terms/OS/view">OS</a> and its
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/application/view">applications</a> (and in some
  unfortunate cases, its <a href="/Computer/Terms/hardware/view">hardware</a>).
  The quick rundown on common home / small business machines (roughly
  from best to worst) is that: 
  <ul>
    <li>All <a href="/Computer/Terms/MacOS/view">Mac OS</a> systems are okay
    until at least the year 2040. By that time a patch
    should be available.</li>
    <li>All <a href="/Computer/Terms/BeOS/view">BeOS</a> systems are okay until
    the year 2040 (2038?). By that time a patch should be
    available.</li>
    <li>Most <a href="/Computer/Terms/UNIX/view">UNIX</a> versions are either
    okay or currently have free fixes available (and
    typically would not have major problems until 2038 or
    later in any case).</li>
    <li><a href="/Computer/Terms/Newton/view">NewtonOS</a> has a problem with
    the year 2010, but has a free fix available.</li>
    <li>Newer <a href="/Computer/Terms/AmigaOS/view">AmigaOS</a> systems are
    okay; older ones have a problem with the year 2000 but
    have a free fix available. They also have a year 2077
    problem that does not yet have a free fix.</li>
    <li>Some <a href="/Computer/Terms/OS2/view">OS/2</a> systems have a year
    2000 problem, but free fixes are available.</li>
    <li>All <a href="/Computer/Terms/CPM/view">CP/M</a> versions have a year
    2000 problem, but free fixes are available.</li>
    <li><a href="/Computer/Terms/PC-DOS/view">PC-DOS</a> has a year 2000
    problem, but a free fix is available.</li>
    <li><a href="/Computer/Terms/DR-DOS/view">DR-DOS</a> has a year 2000
    problem, but a free fix is available.</li>
    <li>Different versions of <a href="/Computer/Terms/GEOS/view">GEOS</a> have
    different problems ranging from minor year 2000
    problems (with fixes in the works) to larger year 2080
    problems (that do not have fixes yet). The only problem
    that may not have a fix in time is the year 2000
    problem on the Apple ][ version of GEOS; not only was
    that version discontinued, unlike the other GEOS
    versions it no longer has a parent company to take care
    of it.</li>
    <li>All <a href="/Computer/Terms/MS-Windows/view">MS-Windows</a> versions
    (except possibly <a href="/Computer/Terms/Win2K/view">Windows 2000</a>
    and <a href="/Computer/Terms/WinME/view">Windows ME</a>) have multiple
    problems with the year 2000 and/or 2001, most of which
    have free fixes but some of which still lack free fixes
    as of this writing. Even new machines off the shelf
    that are labelled &quot;Y2K Compliant&quot; usually are not
    unless additional software is purchased and installed.
    Basically <a href="/Computer/Terms/WinNT/view">WinNT</a> and
    <a href="/Computer/Terms/WinCE/view">WinCE</a> can be properly patched,
    <a href="/Computer/Terms/Win98/view">Windows '98</a> can be patched to work
    properly through 2000 (possibly not 2001),
    <a href="/Computer/Terms/Win95/view">Windows '95</a> can be at least
    partially patched for 2000 (but not 2001) but is not being
    guaranteed by Microsoft, and <a href="/Computer/Terms/Win3.1/view">Windows
    3.1</a> cannot be fully patched.</li>
    <li><a href="/Computer/Terms/MS-DOS/view">MS-DOS</a> has problems with at
    least the year 2000 (and probably more). None of its
    problems have been addressed as of this writing.
    Possible fixes are to change over to either PC-DOS or
    DR-DOS.</li>
  </ul>
  Results vary wildly for common applications, so it is
  better to be safe than sorry and check out the ones that
  you use. It should also be noted that some of the biggest
  expected Y2K problems will be at the two ends of the
  computer spectrum with older legacy
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/mainframe/view">mainframes</a> (such as power
  some large banks) and some of the various tiny
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/embedded/view">embedded</a> computers (such
  as power most burgler alarms and many assorted appliances). Finally, it
  should also be mentioned that some older
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/WinTel/view">WinTel</a> boxes and
  <a href="/Computer/Terms/Amiga/view">Amigas</a> may have Y2K problems
  in their hardware requiring a card addition or replacement.
