<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Go
is a two player board game in which chance plays no part. It is an Oriental
game which originated between 2500 and 4000 years ago and enjoys a similar
status in <st1:country-region u2:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region u2:st="on">China</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region u2:st="on">Taiwan</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region u2:st="on"><st1:place u2:st="on">Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as Chess does in Western countries. </p>

<p>Go is played on a board which consists of a grid made by the intersection of
horizontal and vertical lines. The size of the board is generally 19 x <span
class=grame>19,</span> however, 9 x 9 and 13 x 13 sized boards are also used
for playing quicker games. Intersection points are connected along the
horizontal and vertical lines such that the <span class=spelle>neighbours</span>
of any given point are the intersection points that are horizontally and
vertically adjacent to it. Two players alternate in placing black and white
stones on the intersection points of the board (including edges and corners of
the board) with the black player moving first. The aim of Go is to capture more
territory and prisoners than your opponent. <o:p></o:p></p>

being horizontally or vertically connected to each other (Figure 4). Single
stones can also be described as strings which we will refer to as unitary
strings. Instead of the stones in a string having individual liberties, the
liberties of the constituent stones of the string become the liberties of the
string (points marked L in Figure 5). To be captured, a string must be surrounded
by opponent stones such that no stone in the string has any liberties (black
stones in Figure 6). When a player fills the penultimate liberty of a stone or
string, it is courtesy to declare &quot;Atari!&quot; which alerts the owner of
the stone or string of its impending capture. </p>

are formed when a string surrounds one or more empty intersection points (point

first being surrounded and then the eye being filled (Figure 8). Filling the
eye does not violate the suicide rule since the opponents captured stones are
first removed, creating liberties for the last stone played. A string that has
two eyes (points marked E in Figure 9) is safe from capture since there is no
way for an opponent to capture such a string. The reason for the inability to
capture a string with two eyes is that the stone played in the first eye will
be subject to the suicide rule. </p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2.11 The Go
Handicap and Ranking Systems <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Go
has a sophisticated handicap and ranking system. Players are ranked according
to their ability with a complete novice being ranked at 30 <span class=spelle>kyu</span>
(pronounced &quot;cue&quot;). After playing between 10 and 15 games, a player's
rank would likely be around 20 <span class=spelle>kyu</span>. After reaching 1 <span
class=spelle>kyu</span>, further improvement would result in a rank of 1 <span
class=spelle>dan</span> or first-degree master. Amateur ranks continue <span
class=grame>up to 6 </span><span class=spelle>dan</span>. Professional ranks start
at what would be <span class=grame>7 </span><span class=spelle>dan</span><span
class=grame> amateur</span> and extend from 1 <span class=spelle>dan</span> to
9 <span class=spelle>dan</span>. </p>

<p>The amount of effort required to increase to the next best rank becomes
harder as a player moves up in ranks. For instance, to rise from 20 <span
class=spelle>kyu</span> to 10 <span class=spelle>kyu</span> would require
playing 1 or 2 games a week for around a year and possibly reading a few books
on Go tactics and strategy. [The differentiation between professional ranks is
also smaller than between amateur ranks. The difference between a 1 <span
class=spelle>dan</span> professional and a 9 <span class=spelle>dan</span>
professional is approximately equivalent to the relative difference of 2
amateur <span class=grame>ranks,</span> say 4 <span class=spelle>dan</span> to
6 <span class=spelle>dan</span>.] Many years of full-time play is required to
reach professional ranking. </p>

<p>To provide balance for both weak and strong players, the weak player is
given handicap stones at the start of the game. In the Chinese rules, the
handicap stones are placed at the weaker player's discretion whereas in the
Japanese rules, the handicap stones are placed on set points called <span
class=spelle>hoshi</span> points. The weaker player is given as many handicap
stones as the difference between the <span class=grame>players</span> rankings.
For instance, a 10 <span class=spelle>kyu</span> player would give 5 handicap
stones to a 15 <span class=spelle>kyu</span> player. Ranks are usually
determined in one of two ways. The first is by finding the number of handicap
stones a player needs to win about half the games played against a stronger
player on a 19x19 board. The other is by giving 1 handicap stone for each 10
stones that a player is beaten by. The relative <span class=grame>value of
handicap stones diminish</span> as the board size increases. One handicap stone
on a 9x9 board is worth two on a 13x13 board and four on a 19x19 board. </p>

<p>Playing first without handicap is equivalent to a 5 point advantage. It is
customary for the weaker player to play first using black stones. If both
players are ranked equally, the White player is given a 5 point bonus or <span
class=spelle>komi</span> (pronounced &quot;<span class=spelle>ko-mee</span>&quot;).
In tournaments the <span class=spelle>komi</span> is usually 5 1/2 points so as
to avoid ties. <o:p></o:p></p>

A strong commitment to research on programming Chess in the 1960's and 70's has
not been replicated in the Go field. There are fundamental differences between
Chess and Go which have contributed to making Chess a more attractive research
domain so far. However, even allowing for the smaller amount of work done on
programming Go, the performance of Go programs have not kept pace with the
performance of Chess programs. There are several reasons for this disparity,
which is in part due to the complexity of Go and also the unsuitability of the

<p><b>1. </b>There are fewer types of pieces in Go than chess (in chess there
are 6 types of pieces, whereas in Go each player has only one type, called a
stone). However, the board size is much greater in Go (8x8 squares in chess <span
class=spelle>vs</span> 19x19 grid in Go). </p>

<p><b>2. </b>The size of the board, and the relative freedom in the placement
of stones mean that there are also many more moves made in a typical Go game
(about 80 moves in chess vs. about 300 moves300 moves in Go). </p>

<p><b>3. </b>Stones can be placed anywhere on the board, making for a very
large branching factor in the selection of each move (estimated at ~200),
whereas pieces in chess are constrained to a much smaller set of legal moves
(branch factor of ~ 40). The diversity of chess pieces is exploited to reduce
the branching factor in chess programs in a way that is not possible in Go (see
discussion of evaluation functions in 7. below). The branching factor also
plays a role in the different stages of both games (beginning, middle and end).
In the opening stage of chess, there are many well-known openings, and these
are often followed for up to 10 moves. In Go, the number of sensible openings
is much larger, and set openings are rarely followed for more than about 3
moves. However, there are sequences of moves in local skirmishes, known as <span
class=spelle>joseki</span>, that reflect optimal play (for both sides) in
tactical battles in the corners. Skill in the use of <span class=spelle>joseki</span>
libraries lies in selecting the right <span class=spelle>joseki</span> to <span
class=spelle>optimise</span> interactions with stones outside the region of
interest or diverge from the known sequence to serve other interests. </p>

<p><b>4. </b>Both games can be won by resignation of the opponent, or by an
outright win - check-mate in chess, or surrounding more territory and taking
more prisoners in Go. In chess, the end of a game is easy to determine:
checkmate is simply defined in terms of the position and threats to the King.
In Go, a game is finished when both players pass, but it is frequently
difficult for beginners to know when the end of a game has been reached.
Beginners typically prolong play beyond the point where experts would stop, and
their difficulties are echoed by Go programs, which also have difficulty estimating
when to end a game. The natural end of the game occurs when playing additional
stones reduces the player's score, either by filling in their own territory, or
giving unnecessary prisoners to the opponent. Go programs are often inefficient
in both these ways. There are several different rule systems for scoring in Go:
they are all similar, based on calculating the sum of territory surrounded plus
prisoners taken during the game for each player, and taking the difference
between these scores (a typical margin in a professional game would be less
than five points). </p>

<p><b>5. </b>In both chess and Go, pieces can have long range effects. In chess
the effect is directly a result of some pieces' ability to move many squares (<span
class=spelle>e.g</span>, queens, rooks, bishops). In Go, a stone once placed on
a grid point does not move (although it can be captured and removed from the
board). However, a group (or pattern of stones) does have long range effects in
that it can play a role in a capturing race, or can affect the life and death
struggle of another group. For example, a stone played in the path of a ladder
(a group of stones involved in a certain type of capturing race) can change the
potential to link two stones later in the game - even though the stones are on
the other side of the board. </p>

<p><b>6. </b>The state of the board changes rapidly in chess, as pieces move
positions. In Go, the board is only gradually changing, as stones are added to
the existing configurations. This gradual change compensates significantly for
the greater memory load imposed by the larger board. It also allows accurate
&quot;read-out&quot; of board positions later in the game - even beginners can
read out ladders up to 60 moves ahead (a deep but narrow search). The only time
the physical state of the board changes significantly is when a group is
captured, and the stones are removed from the board. Groups worth as much as 30
points are often won or lost in a game as trade-offs for other groups, even
though the final difference in scores may be just 2 points. </p>

<p><b>7. </b>Evaluation of board positions (in expert human play) typically
reflects both tactical and strategic factors in both chess and Go. However, in
chess, there is a good correlation between the likelihood of winning (from any
stage of the game) and the number and quality of pieces on each side. Thus in
computer chess programs, strategic factors have not been essential in
evaluating board position. In Go, there is no strong correlation between
winning a tactical struggle over a group, and winning the game, as each
tactical struggle over a group requires moves that are not contributing to
another group. Early in the game, players strive to achieve influence on the
board, rather than directly taking territory. In fact, taking territory at the
start of the game can indicate an over-concentrated <span class=grame>position,
that</span> will not be effective in containing the opponent's territorial
moves much later in the game. Algorithmic approaches to measuring the influence
of a position are a standard part of most Go programs but there are no methods
to confirm their efficacy, except for the strength of the program itself which
is usually very weak. </p>

<p><b>8. </b>For all the reasons discussed above, programming approaches to
chess are amenable to tree searches, with good evaluation criteria. Such
approaches have not succeeded in Go, because the branching factor is too large
for brute force search techniques, and pruning is not a viable option without
good evaluation measures. </p>

<p><b>9. </b>Human <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> in chess and Go is very
different. Beginners of both games might start by only looking ahead a few
moves, but in Go, patterns such as ladders can be read out with very little
effort, and beginners are soon able to trace the path of a ladder across the
board (which can require up to 60 moves). However, in these read-out sequences,
there is only one sensible move at each stage, <span class=spelle>i.e</span>, a
series of forcing moves, so there are no alternative paths to follow (see the
horizon effect below). In a typical chess game, expert players may search
alternative possible moves many steps ahead (although typically about 10), but
for each move there are several alternatives. In Go, there are too many
alternatives that are reasonable to search far ahead in most moves, although
for any move, there are likely to be some sequences that can be very deep (e.g.,
ladders). This combination of factors is not captured well by either
breadth-first or depth-first search techniques. </p>

<p><b>10. </b>The horizon effect in chess is where a search to a specific depth
(such as 12 moves ahead) elicits an evaluation that would be radically altered
if a few more moves had been studied. This effect is often seen in sacrifice
moves. The horizon effect begins to be a problem at the Grandmaster level in
chess. In Go, the horizon effect is seen in assessment of even beginner level
play (e.g., ladders). </p>

<p><b>11. </b>Chess was used in the early 1970s to study human grouping
processes, and Chase and Simon (1973) showed that expert chess players view the
board in terms of hierarchical groups of stones. In trying to replicate the
results with Go players, <span class=spelle>Reitman</span> (1976) found a
completely different structure, in which stones are seen as part of many
intersecting groups. Identifying the eventual group to which stones belong is
critical in determining their safety, however, from <span class=spelle>Reitman's</span>
<span class=grame>research,</span> it appears that no clean assignments can be
made until the end stage of the game. Such results indicate sources of
potential problems for computer go programs that assign stones into
hierarchical groups in order to estimate features such as influence. </p>

<p><b>12. </b>One major difference in the actual playing of chess and Go lies
in the standards of the opponents. In chess, a similar standard is required for
an even game. In Go, there is a very effective handicap system, in which a
weaker player starts with a predefined number of stones (usually 2-9) placed at
influential points on the board. Thus the greater skill of one player is offset
by the material advantage of the weaker one. In such contests (and most Go
games are of this type) neither player can assume an infallible opponent, for
the weaker player tries to simplify the game, and play safely, whereas the
stronger player must take more risks, and exploit the weakness of the other
player. Although the final score of a Go game is often used as an indication of
the relative strengths of the players, the important factor is winning, by
however small a margin, rather than taking chances that may increase the
margin, but are not as safe. Thus, estimating the other player's level of skill
is a critical aspect of many Go games. It is also the case that a Go player
needs to be skilled at all facets of the game, rather than having great
strength in just one area. This requirement is because players exploit the
weaknesses of their opponents. It is common to rank the strength of computer Go

The Complexity of Go <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>An
algorithm which can be solved in polynomial time can be practically implemented
to solve &quot;real-world&quot; problems. Algorithms which cannot be solved in
polynomial time are described as exponential-time algorithms. Except for very
small problem spaces, these algorithms are impractical. Problems that can be
solved by a computer with a polynomial amount of memory space are said to be
solvable in P-space. </p>

<p>It has been shown that, given an arbitrary Go position on an n x n board,
determining the winner is P-space hard (Lichtenstein and <span class=spelle>Sipser</span>,
1980). This result used together with situations arising from <span
class=spelle>ko</span> positions have been used to show that for an arbitrary
Go position on an n x n board, deciding whether Black can force a win or
deciding on Black's best move is exponential-time complete (Robson, 1983).
These results indicate that the use of approximation algorithms which return
near-optimal solutions are necessary to solve some aspects of Go and that
brute-force search methods will quickly run into difficulties. </p>

<p>A comparison of the complexity of Go to the complexity of other games is
provided in Allis <i>et al.</i> (1991). They defined the terms cracked and
solved, and illustrated the difference between search-space complexity and
decision complexity. A game is said to be cracked if a program is capable of
achieving the best possible theoretical results regardless of its opposition.
To be solved, the best move must be explicable in human terms. The difference
between search-space complexity and decision complexity is illustrated by a
variant of Go. The variant consists of players alternatively placing stones on
unoccupied points of the board or passing. The first player to place 181 stones
wins. This variant has the same search-space complexity as <span class=grame>Go</span>,
however, since if the player moving first does not pass is bound to win, the
decision complexity is trivial. </p>

<p>Allis <i>et al.</i> graphed log <span class=spelle>log</span> search-space
complexity versus log decision complexity, dividing the graph into solvable and
unsolvable space for 16 games. Go was shown to be the most complex in both log <span
class=spelle>log</span> search-space complexity and log decision complexity and
to be in the unsolvable area. A comparison of Go and Chess shows that 9x9 Go is
around about the same complexity as Chess (35 versus 50 in 10 log search space)
and that 19x19 Go is a vastly more complex game than Chess and may well be
unsolvable as defined above (Allis <i>et al.</i> (1991). <o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3.3 Why Go <span
class=grame>Cannot</span> be Programmed Like Chess <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Chess
programs typically use a heuristic search and evaluation technique. Search
trees of board positions are generated to a fixed depth and are heuristically
pruned according to an evaluation of the merit of the board positions. This
approach works well in Chess because the board size is sufficiently small and
the nature of Chess is more tactical than strategic. </p>

<p>Evaluation of a board position in Go presents problems not encountered in
Chess. Go is a much more strategic game in comparison to Chess. Unlike Chess,
Go does not focus around the capture of a single piece. Positional advantages
are slowly built up in achieving the long term goal of acquiring more territory
than the opponent. There are many direct and indirect ways to achieve this goal
such as making territory, building influence, attacking weak enemy groups,
securing friendly groups, destroying enemy territory etc. Due to the large size
of the board, a Go game is comprised of many small local skirmishes. If a game
of Chess were described as a battle, a game of Go could be described as a war.
Many good tactical moves at the local level must all compete for selection in
the context of strategic global considerations. Thus a player must balance
resources to achieve local goals at many locations whilst trying to pursue an
overall global objective. </p>

<p>Due to the problems associated with evaluation, the brute force methods
employed in AI to program Chess will not work for Go. As a domain, Go is rich
for research in AI and cognitive science. Hans Berliner, a former Correspondence
Chess World Champion, a top-ranked <st1:country-region u2:st="on"><st1:place u2:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>

saying &quot;... this game may have to replace Chess as the `task par
excellence' for AI&quot; (Berliner, 1978). <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
earliest Go program was written by Albert <span class=spelle>Zobrist</span> as
part of a PhD thesis on pattern recognition (<span class=spelle>Zobrist</span>,

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Influence Function <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
class=spelle>Zobrist</span> introduced the idea of using an influence function
to segment the board into black and white territories. The influence function
computed a numeric value for every point on the board. Black stones were given
a value of +50 and white stones a value of -50 and empty points were given a
value of 0. The <span class=spelle>neighbours</span> of every point that had a
positive influence value had +1 added to their influence value and similarly
the <span class=spelle>neighbours</span> of points with negative influence
values had -1 added to their influence values. This process was repeated
another three times (for a total of four times). This influence function spread
black and white influence numerically and <span class=spelle>Zobrist</span>
then segmented the board into areas of contiguous positive and negative numeric
values (Figure 17). <br>
<span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=448 height=239
id="_x0000_i1028" src="CS-TR-339_files/fig17.gif"></span></p>

<p>The program constructed an internal representation of the board which was
stored as numeric values in various 19x19 arrays. The representation included
arrays containing information such as: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:

     style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'> (including empty
     points) and number of stones in each segment. <o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
program also used a second influence function to store an internal
representation which measured the influence of stones. It was similar to the
influence described above except that occupied points were initially given
values of +100 and positive points radiated +3 to their <span class=spelle>neighbours</span>
whilst negative points radiated -4 to their <span class=spelle>neighbours</span>.
Since the computer played black (positive values), this influence function
overstated the opponent's influence value so that the program would play
cautiously. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Selecting a Move <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Having
constructed an internal representation, the program performed pattern
recognition over the entire board which amounted to searching for certain
numeric patterns contained in the program's various arrays. Along with each
pattern would be stored an associated move and a numeric value reflecting the
priority of the move. When a pattern match was made, the numeric value would be
added to the point corresponding to the associated move. An attempt was made to
match each pattern &quot;known&quot; to the program across the entire board, rotating
and reflecting the patterns as necessary. At the end of this process, the point
with the highest value became the program's next move. Thus <span class=spelle>Zobrist's</span>
program used summed feature evaluation to choose its next move. </p>

<p>The program exhibited weaknesses in its play which <span class=spelle>Zobrist</span>
wished to overcome. He divided the game into four phases: corner and edge play
at the beginning, extension into the centre of the board, <span class=spelle>defence</span>
and attack of loosely staked out territories, and stabilizing surrounded
territories. To enable the program to play appropriate moves during the various
phases, only appropriate patterns (along with patterns which were relevant
throughout the entire game) were allowed to be matched during those phases. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Results and
Improvements <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Another
addition to the program was limited <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> or
heuristic search. During the pattern recognition process, local areas would be
suggested for further examination by <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> which
was carried out to a depth of three moves. The program handled saving/capturing
strings, connecting/cutting strings, ladders, and the formation of eyes using <span
class=spelle>lookahead</span>. </p>

<p>The performance of <span class=spelle>Zobrist's</span> program was modest,
beating two novices but performing poorly against experienced players. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>4.1.2 Ryder <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Jon
Ryder's program (Ryder, 1971) can be seen as an extension of <span
class=spelle>Zobrist's</span> approach in as much as it used an influence
function and move selection was based on summed feature evaluation. However,
Ryder added both strategic and tactical considerations and also used <span
class=spelle>lookahead</span> extensively. The distinction drawn by Ryder
between tactics and strategy was that tactical considerations dealt with
short-term objectives whilst strategic considerations dealt with long-term
objectives </p>

<p>Due to the intractability of using game trees in Go, a suitable replacement
had to be found. Ryder's program used the combined analyses of many local
tactical problems performed by <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> together
with other analyses as a replacement for the game tree. </p>

<p>Ryder saw Go as a game which required a balance between acquiring actual or
potential territory and avoiding the loss of important stones to the opponent.
He formulated three areas of interest which were designed to help maintain this
balance: board organization showing degree of control of each side over various
regions; identification of areas of best play for both sides; and analysis of
strings to determine whether they are safe or endangered. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Selecting a Move <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Move
generation was accomplished in two passes. In the first pass, the tactical <span
class=grame>status of all strings were</span> determined. Armies, walls and
groups were identified and a process of developmental analysis was performed on
each which resulted in determining areas and endangered groups for each player.
Each legal move was then examined in an attempt to eliminate as many as
possible from future consideration with the fifteen best moves being further <span
class=spelle>analysed</span> in the second pass. </p>

<p>The second pass began with an analysis of the best fifteen moves from the
first pass with respect to tactical and naive strategic theories. The score
obtained by a move from these analyses were added to the score obtained in the
developmental analysis. The move with the highest combined score after the
first and second passes was then recommended as the next move. Second pass
analysis would stop before all fifteen moves were <span class=spelle>analysed</span>
if an &quot;obviously&quot; best move was identified. </p>

<p>Ryder's program used a forward-pruning method to search the game trees that
resulted during <span class=spelle>lookahead</span>. In forward pruning, a
decision based on various criteria is made regarding the desirability of
pursuing a given branch in a <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> tree i.e.
whether the future <span class=grame>implications of a particular move is</span>
worth examining. The criteria for terminating a particular search tree included
whether a target string had two eyes, whether a saving move resulted in more
than five liberties, or it was unlikely that the target would be captured. The
danger in forward pruning is that the best move may be discarded before it has
been examined. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Influence Function <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Like
<span class=spelle>Zobrist</span>, Ryder also used an influence function to
provide a numeric number to indicate the degree of tactical control each stone
exerted over its <span class=spelle>neighbours</span>. His influence function
was similar to <span class=spelle>Zobrist's</span> in that black influence was
positive and white influence was negative and the influence value at each point
was the sum of the influence values propagated by its nearby <span
class=spelle>neighbours</span>. Ryder's influence function was simpler than <span
class=spelle>Zobrist's</span> in that each stone contributed an influence value
to its nearby <span class=spelle>neighbours</span> according to a table of
values (Figure 18). </p>

<p><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=447 height=212
id="_x0000_i1027" src="CS-TR-339_files/fig18.gif"></span></p>

<h3><span class=grame><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ryder's
influence function.</span></span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p>Both too much and too little influence at a point indicated a problem with
playing at that point. Too much influence indicated that there was an
over-concentration to the detriment of the global situation whereas too little
influence indicated that there was the possibility of capture by the opponent.
Optimal moves were those that were close to the peak of the value/influence
curve. Influence was regarded by Ryder to be a local property of a stone
although he admitted that there were cases (such as ladder-breakers), in which
stones exerted control on distant parts of the board. In such situation where
the influence value was not a reliable measure, tactical evaluation was used to
overcome the short-comings of the influence function. </p>

<p>One situation in which the influence function was not a good measure was
that of connectivity. Ryder defined two terms: connectedness and strongly
related. The definition for connectedness was that a point was connected to <span
class=spelle>colour</span> X if it was occupied by a non-dead stone of <span
class=spelle>colour</span> X, or if it was empty, it was adjacent to at least
one stone of <span class=spelle>colour</span> X and none of the opposite <span
class=spelle>colour</span>. An extension to connectedness was
half-connectedness. An empty point was half-connected to <span class=spelle>colour</span>
X if it was adjacent to at least two stones of <span class=spelle>colour</span>
X and one or more stones of the opposite <span class=spelle>colour</span>. The
definition of strongly related was that a point was strongly related to <span
class=spelle>colour</span> X if it was occupied by or adjacent to a stone of <span
class=spelle>colour</span> X. A point could also be strongly related to <span
class=spelle>colour</span> X if it was diagonally adjacent to a stone of <span
class=spelle>colour</span> X with at least one empty point (<span class=spelle>kosumi</span>
link) or no more than one empty point away (<span class=spelle>ikken-tobi</span>
link). Groups were defined as sets of points which were connected or half-connected.
</p>

<p>The influence function was particularly suited to determining walls and
armies. Walls were defined as a connected set of points in which the influence
values were equal to or larger than a predefined wall threshold. Similarly,
armies were defined as a set of points including empty points in which the
influence <span class=grame>value were</span> equal to or larger than a
predefined army threshold. </p>

<p>The tactical concepts employed in Ryder's program included liberty
estimation, <span class=grame>ko</span>, ladders and snapbacks, and eyes and
false eyes. Ryder admitted that improvement was needed in the program's
tactical ability which he described as &quot;blunder avoidance&quot;. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Representation <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Information
was included in the representation if it satisfied any of the following
criteria: it was basic and was needed in many calculations; it took a
significant effort to re-calculate and was used more than once; or it was
accessed many times and was constant through many if not all of those accesses.
</p>

<p>Groups and armies were represented in a pointer-based manner. There was a
pointer from each point in a group or an army to the entity descriptor of the
group or army it belonged to. Each entity had a pointer to one of the points
that comprised it which was the base point for that entity. Searches for points
near entities were initiated from the base point. </p>

<p>The global representation of the board was contained in a 21x21 array (19x19
with an empty point border around the outside). By using various bits in the
memory location of each point in the array, the following information/pointers
were able to be stored: area number; army number; wall number; group number;
string number; and current state (black, white or empty). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Results and
Improvements <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Ryder
reported the results of only one game which was lost to a novice which had just
learned the rules and had been given some rudimentary tips on the tactics and
strategies of Go. With regard to Ryder's main interest, he reported that the
tactical analysis was quite an efficient searching mechanism which provided valuable
information for move generation and compared <span class=spelle>favourably</span>
to the powers of analysis exhibited by human beginners. He was also of the
opinion that only a small effort would be required to improve the program's
tactical strength. </p>

<p>Future improvements suggested by Ryder included re-using previously
calculated information in searching, the incorporation of distant
ladder-breakers into tactical analysis and improving the definition of
endangered groups. Ryder identified the developmental analysis stage which consumed
around 10% of the processing time as needing attention. One possible reason for
the poor performance of Ryder's program was that it made no distinction between
the opening, mid and end games and was therefore playing inappropriate tactical
moves in the end game in particular. The addition of such distinction was
recognized to be of importance in future improvements by Ryder. <o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>4.1.3 <span
class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Walter
<span class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Bruce Wilcox began using Go to conduct
research in 1972. The program that resulted from that research has been
described both as the <span class=spelle>Reitman</span>-Wilcox Go program and
to the INTERIM.2 Go program. After the research project was discontinued,
Wilcox rewrote the INTERIM.2 program to produce NEMESIS, a commercial Go
program. </p>

<p>The research conducted by <span class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox using
Go was predominately in the Artificial Intelligence area and included pattern
recognition (<span class=spelle>Reitman</span> et al., 1978; <span
class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox, 1975,1978), planning (<span
class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox, 1974) and replication of human
perceptual and cognitive abilities in Go. Indeed, the objective of program was
to model human go play and to this end, they videotaped protocols and post-game
analyses of a strong Go player to try to ascertain how humans play Go. </p>

<p>According to <span class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox, the three
essential ingredients to a Go program are perception, knowledge and
coordination (Wilcox, 1988). They tried to incorporate into their programs
representation as many of the perceptions of a skilled Go player as they could.
They identified and stored two types of Go knowledge: process knowledge which
included how to kill a group, how to make territory, etc, and evaluation
knowledge which enabled the stability of groups etc. to be judged, the
estimation of relative values, etc. Coordination of the program's perceptions
and knowledge was achieved through appropriate control structures which allowed
it to choose the next move. </p>

<p>The INTERIM.2 program created and maintained a representation that was a
selectively updated, multilevel network which <span class=spelle>Reitman</span>
and Wilcox said was analogous to the type of perceptual and cognitive
representation a skilled Go player would create. There was a hierarchy of
experts and critics which operated on the network which chose the next move. <span
class=spelle>Lookahead</span> was not full-<span class=grame>board,</span>
rather it was a selective, goal-driven process. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The INTERIM.2
Program <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>INTERIM.2
summarized information up and filtered decisions down (Wilcox, 1988).
Information contained in low-level representations e.g. strings, were
summarized and used in high-level representations e.g. groups. The program made
decisions at a high-level about what to &quot;focus on&quot;. These decisions
were filtered down to lower levels and influenced decisions made at those
levels. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Flow of Control <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
program stored its representation in a structure called GAMEMAP which was
indexed through a set of interrelated arrays called GAMEBOARDS. In each
GAMEBOARD array there were pointers that pointed to every instance of a
particular data structure e.g. STRING-BOARD contained pointers to every string on
the board. The GAMEBOARDS progressed from simple to complex: TYPEBOARD,
STRINGBOARD, <span class=grame>LINKBOARD</span>. Special GAME-BOARDS such as
LENSBOARD, WEBBOARD, SECTORBOARD and TACTICSBOARD were designed to contain
representations which corresponded <span class=grame>to a skilled human players
perceptual and cognitive representations</span>. </p>

<p>The flow of control in the INTERIM.2 program oscillated between MOVE and
REFLEX. MOVE selectively updated the components of GAMEMAP that were affected
when stones, black or white, were placed on the board. REFLEX was responsible
for choosing the program's next move which was achieved by stepping through an
ordered list of functions and accepting the first move returned by them. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Tactician
(PROBE) <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
program's tactician, PROBE, was used to answer specific questions and therefore
performed narrow, goal-driven <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> instead of
general purpose, full-board <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> that is common
in Chess programs. The basic assumption behind PROBE was that if the results of
a small number of intelligently chosen lines were the same for a given
question, then those results would most likely be the answer to that question.
Such an assumption is not always valid, however, <span class=spelle>Reitman</span>
and Wilcox felt it was a small price to pay for a quick searching and was not
dissimilar to the penalties experienced when human searches failed for similar
reasons. PROBE was designed to model how skilled human Go players performed
tactical problem solving by selective <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> (<span
class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox, 1979). </p>

<p>PROBE would be employed to answer a specific question and would propose a
reasonable initial <span class=spelle>move.The</span> initial move would be
hypothetically played and a new hypothetical board position would result. PROBE
would then propose another reasonable move based on the hypothetical board
position. This would continue until a position was reached which could be
judged as either a success or a failure with respect to the specific question
that PROBE was trying to answer. If the position was a success, PROBE returned
the initial move as the result. If the position was a failure, the hypothetical
moves were retracted until there was a position in which a reasonable
alternative move could be made and the process was repeated. In unrestricted <span
class=spelle>lookahead</span>, all moves were examined in this fashion so that
the best move could be discovered. In PROBE, not even all reasonable moves were
examined. Each side was limited to two or three failed variations before the
search was terminated and a failure result was returned. </p>

<p>The selection and examination of reasonable moves was conducted by a
hierarchy of experts which formed, evaluated and implemented goal-directed
&quot;chains of thought&quot; (Wilcox, 1988). There were a variety of experts
including experts that generated goals and <span class=spelle>subgoals</span>,
experts that proposed moves to realize goals, experts that used exclusively the
current board position and current goals, and experts that used all goals and <span
class=spelle>subgoals</span>. The experts contained a large amount of specific
Go knowledge. The control structures implemented by <span class=spelle>Reitman</span>
and Wilcox in PROBE allowed the knowledge contained in the various experts to
be organized, easily debugged, and readily extended (Wilcox, 1988). The
goal-directed <span class=spelle>behaviour</span> of PROBE resulted in very
restrictive searching which typically resulted in around 60 - 80 hypothetical
moves per <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> (Wilcox, 1988). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perceptions and
Representations <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>INTERIM.2
maintained many different data structures in its representation. Point
occupancy (black, white, empty) was used to determine strings. A basic property
of each string was whether it could be captured or saved. The links recognized
by INTERIM.2 were <span class=spelle>kosumi</span>, <span class=spelle>ikken-tobi</span>,
<span class=spelle>nikken-tobi</span>, <span class=spelle>kogeima</span> and <span
class=spelle>ogeima</span>. Links were classified as normal (connectable), dead
(<span class=spelle>unconnectable</span> but potentially useful) or string capture
(linkages between strings capturing an opponent string). Basic properties of
linkages included whether they could be joined or cut, whether they crossed
opponent links, and why they were created. Special edge linkages which were
links from strings up to the fourth line to the edge of the board were also
recognized. Sector lines were long range links and were used in stability
assessment and move generation. Virtual strings were strings connected by
unbreakable links. Groups were sets of strings joined together by links.
Enclosed territory was a set of empty points or dead stones that were enclosed
by strings, linkages and edge <span class=spelle>linkages.The</span> motivation
for moves e.g. why a link was created, was explicitly tracked to facilitate
move selection and to ease debugging. </p>

<p>Influence was radiated using Ryder's algorithm. <span class=spelle>Reitman</span>
and Wilcox saw influence as misleading in certain situations and therefore
developed the notion of influence blocks. Areas of empty, contiguous,
same-signed influence points that did not include linkage points were collected
into a structure. The perimeter of these structures were located and then
iteratively &quot;shrunk&quot; to provide nested loops. Since shrinking did not
take place across stones or linkage points, it was possible that the loops
created in the shrinking process would become arc segments or strips.
Eventually individual structures emerged which were called influence blocks.
Points contained in an influence block were considered more likely to be turned
into territory the further they were away from the perimeter of the block. </p>

<p>Creating and maintaining INTERIM.2's representation was described by <span
class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox as perception and the data structures
used were also sometimes referred to as perceptual <span class=spelle>representations.Two</span>
components of the perception system employed by the INTERIM.2 program are
particularly interesting. Webs were used to determine what regions could be
&quot;seen&quot; from a stone and lenses were used to monitor actual patterns
of stones in a game using the program's knowledge of Go patterns. </p>

<p>A web was constructed around a group as concentric &quot;circles&quot; of
liberty points (circumferential strands) to a maximum depth of nine levels.
Radial strands emanated from the groups. The web did not continue behind other
stones, either friendly or unfriendly. Links between stones and between stones
and the edge of the board (up to three moves away) also stopped a web. The
continuous loop of the outermost points of a web comprised its perimeter. The
points between the group and the perimeter were considered to be transparent.
The perimeter of a web was useful information for a group in deciding where
potential threats might come from, where it could run to avoid those threats,
the location of nearby friendly groups, where linkages might be attacked etc. </p>

<p>To <span class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox, local stone configurations
and their transformation by sequences of moves is a fundamental aspect of Go.
Sequences of moves associated with standard configurations e.g. attacking or
defending a <span class=spelle>kogeima</span> link, are recognized by competent
Go players. Lenses were designed to monitor such configurations and suggest
moves that were known pattern continuations. </p>

<p>A lens was comprised of a set of fields. Each field consists of a set of
points and watches for the development of a sequence of moves. The lens in turn
supplied information about the suggested moves and global status information to
the tactician. When a field recognized a configuration, it supplied suggested
moves and other associated information to the lens. When fields no longer
recognized patterns they were discarded which caused a lens to get smaller over
time. This in effect amounted to the &quot;focus&quot; of a lens becoming more
concentrated over time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
results of three games played by the INTERIM.2 program are reported in <span

ranked 22 and 34 <span class=spelle>kyu</span> and one was lost against a
player ranked 4 <span class=spelle>kyu</span>. The computed ranking of the
INTERIM.2 program from these games was 27 <span class=spelle>kyu</span>. </p>

<p><span class=spelle>Reitman</span> and Wilcox were pleased with the
performance of the INTERIM.2 program in regard to their initial objectives of <span
class=spelle>modelling</span> human play. It played conservatively, choosing to
defend endangered groups in preference to attacking opponent groups. It
defended well; the only cases in which it lost groups (other than due to bugs)
were when several groups were simultaneously endangered. <o:p></o:p></p>

representative search which Wilcox found to be frequently exhibited by Go
players (<span class=spelle>Kerwin</span> and Wilcox, 1973). </p>

<p>A representative search provides information about many potential move

<span class=spelle>Lehner's</span> results suggested that representative <span

then developed a classification technique called pattern preference which
automated the process of deriving patterns that were representative of good

requirements increased. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sander <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>To
avoid the combinatorial explosion that results from using tree search to
evaluate and select moves, Peter Sander (1979) devised a program with a
top-down or goal directed organization that used strategies to generate
possible moves. Sander's program (called <span class=spelle>Kyu</span>) generated
bottom-up hierarchically structured descriptions of board positions which were
incrementally updated after every move. It progressively refined its strategies
into goals and then selected moves. <span class=spelle>Kyu</span> only played
the opening game to move 25 and an intended look-ahead mechanism was also not
implemented. </p>

<p><span class=spelle>Kyu's</span> data structures were based on linked records
which represented strings, groups and armies of both <span class=spelle>colours</span>.
From any point on the board, it was possible to access the <span class=grame>string,</span>
group and army that the point belonged to if occupied, or had influence over it
if unoccupied, by following pointers. After each move, the data structures were
incrementally updated to reflect the changes caused by a move. The update was
from low-level to high-level: from points to strings, from strings to groups,
and from groups to armies. </p>

<p>The architecture which was instantiated in <span class=spelle>Kyu</span> was
summarized by Sander as being comprised of a multi-level structured data
representation, and a hierarchically organized planning system which explicitly
encoded strategies and goals. He also believed that such <span class=grame>an
architecture</span> had applications in different domains other than Go. </p>

<h3><span class=spelle><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Friedenbach</span></span><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'> <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Kenneth
<span class=spelle>Friedenbach</span> studied the interaction of perception and
cognition in the solution of complex problems by using Go as a domain (<span
class=spelle>Friedenbach</span>, 1988). He formalized the notion of abstraction
hierarchies which are based on graph theory and then applied them to <span
class=grame>Go</span>. The use of Go as a domain was because, according to <span
class=spelle>Friedenbach</span>, concepts in the Go literature are related in a
multi-level hierarchy. </p>

<p><span class=spelle>Friedenbach's</span> model of perception and cognition
involved three components. The first was a hierarchy of static objects which
consisted of five levels: the points of the board, strings of similar points,
groups of related strings, loose federations of groups or potential groups
(armies), and a summary of the properties of the federations in a global level.
The second was an analytic component concerned with changes in structures as a
result of sequences of moves or transformations that are considered. The third
was an integration component concerned with the retention and application of
information from one analyses to another. </p>

<p>Four types of analysis were carried out. Tactical Safety analysis was
carried out at the string level and was concerned with capturing and protecting
strings. Strategic Safety analysis was concerned with killing and defending
groups and involved <span class=spelle>analysing</span> eyes and connections.
Strategic Development analysis was carried out at the group level and was
concerned with open areas, balance measures, the growth of new groups, and the
interactions of emerging groups. Global Balance analysis was the highest level
of analysis and was concerned with initiative and the overall strategy of the game.
</p>

<p><span class=spelle>Friedenbach</span> characterizes an analysis by three
conditions: the condition under which it is performed, the conditions under
which it is terminated, causing its evaluation, and the conditions under which
continuations are chosen. <span class=spelle>Friedenbach</span> uses tactical
analysis as an example. Tactical analysis is invoked whenever there is a string
that has less than three liberties and is terminated when all strings have
three or more liberties. Continuation involves considering <span class=spelle>atari</span>
moves and captures by the attacker, and captures or liberty increasing moves by
the defender. A reanalysis would result if a move was made which affected the
number of liberties of a key string during the analysis. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
class=spelle>Fotland's</span> first Go program determined territory by
radiating influence. Unfortunately, it could be beaten by a simple liberty
filling algorithm so he discarded it and wrote G2. The internal structure of G2
was described by <span class=spelle>Fotland</span> in terms of its data
structures, its tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span>, and its move
selector (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1986). G2 used full board reading
and evaluated all legal moves with an emphasis on strategic moves. After the
full board evaluation of all moves, the move that received the highest score
was played. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Data Structures
<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Most
of G2's code was devoted to updating the data structures. Stones occupied
points (referred to as squares) and were organized into strings (referred to as
groups) and then into groups (referred to as armies). Data was associated with
each point on the board and included the distance to the nearest and second
nearest edge, a list of adjacent and diagonal <span class=spelle>neighbours</span>,
string number of the stone occupying the point, the number and a list of
liberties, <span class=spelle>colour</span> of stones on <span class=spelle>neighbouring</span>
points (white, black, or mixed), an influence function, and the nearest
occupied point in each direction. </p>

<p>Horizontally or vertically adjacent points containing like-<span
class=spelle>coloured</span> stones were <span class=spelle>organised</span>
into strings. String data included <span class=spelle>colour</span>, number and
list of liberties, a list of its connections, a list of <span class=spelle>neighbouring</span>
enemy strings, the army it was part of, and an aliveness value (described
below). </p>

<p>The types of connections recognized by G2 included one and two point jumps,
diagonal connection and knight's move. Connection data included the strings it
joined, its type, the points involved, and its status. </p>

<p>Groups were comprised of strings which were connected by unbreakable
connections or were both adjacent to a dead enemy string. Group data included a
list of its constituent strings and dead enemy strings used as connections, the
number of stones and liberties, the number of eyes, and an aliveness value. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Tactical <span
class=spelle>Analyser</span> <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span> was used to evaluate board
positions so that a move could be selected. Each group was assigned an
aliveness value which was also inherited by its constituent strings. The
strength of G2 was primarily determined by the tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span>
and consumed the largest portion of <span class=spelle>Fotland's</span> effort
(<span class=spelle>Fotland</span> 1986). Since most of the program's time was
spent in the tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span>, it had to be both
fast and efficient in its pruning of search trees. </p>

<p>Aliveness values resulted from a multi-stage process: strings which could be
captured were identified as dead; eyes were found by the eye evaluator;
unbreakable connection were identified; connected strings were identified as groups;
territory was determined by the territory evaluator; and the life and death
evaluator assigned an aliveness value to each group which was then assigned to
its constituent strings. </p>

<p>The tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span> examined every string with
less than five liberties to determine whether it was dead i.e., whether it
could be captured; strings which could obtain at least five liberties were
assumed to avoid capture. Interesting moves were suggested during <span
class=spelle>lookahead</span> to determine the status of a string. Interesting
attacking moves included <span class=spelle>geta</span> moves for groups with
two liberties, liberty filling moves, moves adjacent to an enemy string's
liberties, and liberty gaining moves for friendly strings. Interesting
defensive moves included diagonal moves into unoccupied territory, one point
jumps, extensions, connections, and liberty filling moves (for adjacent enemy
strings). </p>

<p>The interesting moves were heuristically evaluated and the best were
selected for further analysis. The best of these moves was hypothetically
played and the resulting situation <span class=spelle>analysed</span> from the <span
class=grame>opponents</span> point of view. Once again, the best moves were
chosen and the best one was hypothetically played. Normal backtracking was used
at each stage as well as alpha-beta pruning. Thus, a depth-first tree was
generated until the string being examined was captured or gained sufficient
liberties to live. The search tree was generated to a maximum of 80 moves which
still enabled ladders to be accurately read. The number of &quot;best
moves&quot; considered (between 1 and 3) depended on the depth of the current
move in the search tree: more moves were considered near the root and less near
the leaves. Since the value of the terminal node had only two values (i.e., captured
or escaped), alpha-beta pruning was very efficient (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>,
1996). </p>

<p>An eye evaluator was used to maintain information about eyes, half eyes
(eyes made in <span class=spelle>gote</span>) and quarter eyes (eyes needing
two moves to be made) by evaluating small enclosed <span class=spelle>eyespace</span>.
G2 <span class=spelle>recognised</span> some basic dead shapes and various
types of eyes including three in a row, four in a square, bulky five, pyramid,
and cross. </p>

<p>Groups were determined by finding strings that were connected by unbreakable
connections. The tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span> tried to cut connections
to test their strength. Dead opponent strings could also be used as connections
between live friendly strings. </p>

<p>Territory was determined by the territory evaluator. As well as completely
enclosed territory, G2 also evaluated territory near the board edge which did
not need to be completely enclosed. Territory could be made near the edge by
being between a stone and the edge or a connection and the edge. However, such
territory could be challenged by a stone within four lines along the edge, and closer
to the edge (undercutting the edge). </p>

<p>The life and death evaluator <span class=spelle>analysed</span> every group.
An aliveness value was assigned to each group by considering the number of
liberties it had, its <span class=spelle>eyespace</span>, the amount of
territory it controlled, whether it could extend along the edge, its size,
whether it was in contact with an enemy string, and whether it was completely
surrounded. The aliveness value rating itself had 20 different values including
&quot;has two eyes&quot;, &quot;has enough space to make two eyes&quot;,
&quot;unsettled&quot;, &quot;not enough <span class=spelle>eyespace</span>&quot;,
and &quot;can't possibly make two eyes&quot;. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Move Selector <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>A
rule-based strategic evaluator with 65 rules was used to select moves by
choosing the highest scoring move using a two step process. In the first step,
strategic moves were evaluated and in the second step, all legal moves were
evaluated. Information from the data structures and the tactical <span
class=spelle>analyser</span> was used to evaluate board positions resulting
from moves in both step one and two. <span class=spelle>Fotland</span> felt
that this was the weakest component of G2 due to the weakness of the data
structures (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1986). </p>

<p>The rules suggested strategic moves to evaluate such as playing in an empty
corner, make <span class=spelle>shimari</span> or <span class=spelle>kakari</span>,
a move from the <span class=spelle>joseki</span> dictionary, extending along an
edge, invasions, contact fights, blocking, cutting, connecting, blocking an
invasion on a wall, or making a <span class=grame>ko</span> threat. </p>

<p>In the first step, all the suggested strategic moves were evaluated. A
particular strategic move was hypothetically played and the resulting board
position was evaluated. The evaluation process consisted of assigning values to
the board points and then summing them together to return an overall score. The
value for a given board point was determined by the aliveness value of the
string that controlled it. If the board position resulting from a strategic
move did not satisfy the strategic goals associated with the rule that
suggested it, the evaluation of the move was ignored. </p>

<p>In the second step, all legal moves (including the strategic moves
considered in the first step) were evaluated. The value assigned to a board
position resulting from hypothetically playing a move was based on the
aliveness, size, and amount of territory controlled by each string on the
board. </p>

<p>The values that resulted for each move from step two were summed with the
value they obtained if they were considered in step one. The move with the
overall highest score was then chosen as G2's next move. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Data Structures <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
data structures used in <span class=spelle>Comos</span> were basically the same
as those used in G2. The eye information included the number of eyes achievable
in <span class=spelle>gote</span>, the number of eyes achievable in <span
class=spelle>sente</span>, the number of eyes achievable if the opponent moved
twice, a list of vital points, and eye type. The information contained in the
data structures was updated either incrementally (e.g., lists of liberties) or
after every move (e.g., influence). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tactician <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Essentially,
Cosmos had the same tactician as G2 but better move generation and sorting. In
Cosmos, the tactician was only used to determine dead and threatened strings by
trying to capture them. Its parameters were maximum liberty count, maximum,
depth, and maximum search size. The maximum liberty count was 4, and therefore
as for G2, strings with more than 4 liberties were assumed to avoid <span
class=spelle>capture.The</span> maximum depth allowed was 100. The search size
determined the playing level (<span class=spelle>Stoutamire</span>, 1991) and
since forcing moves were not counted, ladders could be accurately read even at
low playing levels. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Influence Function <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Territory
was determined by radiating positive influence from <span class=grame>alive</span>
groups and negative influence from dead groups. Radiated influence did not pass
through stones or connections and was inversely proportional to distance. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Board Evaluation <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Life
and death of groups was the primary concern dealt with by the evaluation
process. Board positions were evaluated by a similar process to that used in G2
with the addition of quiescent search. </p>

<p>The tactician was used to determine dead and threatened strings (those that
could be captured if they moved second) and whether the stones at the diagonal
of eyes could be captured. This information was useful in identifying
unbreakable connections and forming strings into groups. </p>

<p>Eyes were <span class=spelle>analysed</span> to determine their potential
and then allocated to groups. False eyes were identified by checking the
diagonals of eyes and some dead shapes were also known by Cosmos. Any group
with enough <span class=spelle>eyespace</span> to make two eyes was considered
to be alive. Potential eye space could be gained by extensions along the edge,
possible connections, being adjacent to a threatened enemy group, and by
controlling territory which was not already considered to be an eye. </p>

<p>There were 25 values that described a <span class=grame>groups</span>
strength in terms of its life and death status. The values were divided into
five main categories which included very alive, alive, unsettled, weak and
dead. Determining the strength of a group included considering potential
connections, potential eyes, and potential extensions along the edge. Positive
influence was radiated from <span class=grame>alive</span> groups and negative
influence was radiated from dead groups with black and white influence being
maintained separately. </p>

<p>Weak groups which were contacted by the influence from friendly alive groups
were considered not to be surrounded. Weak groups were further divided into
those that could run and fight and those which would almost certainly die. </p>

<p>In general, board points were scored according to the radiated influence
values. However, occupied board points, board points adjacent to a stone and
board points between a stone and an edge were scored differently. Unsettled
groups were scored according to <span class=grame>who</span> as to play next. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Move Selection <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Cosmos
had over 250 rules that suggested moves which included <span class=spelle>fuseki</span>
moves (including <span class=spelle>shimari</span>, <span class=spelle>kakari</span>
and <span class=spelle>joseki</span> moves), edge moves, playing in the centre,
playing safe when ahead of opponent, &quot;squirming&quot; around when behind
opponent, pattern matching, saving weak friendly groups (including making eyes,
running, or fighting <span class=spelle>semeais</span>), killing weak enemy
groups, cutting, connecting, contact fights, <span class=spelle>ko</span>
threats, and filling dame. Cosmos had a <span class=spelle>joseki</span>
library which contained around 5000 suggested <span class=spelle>joseki</span>
moves and a pattern database which had 60 patterns which were 5 x 5 in size.
Whenever a match was made, the rule (code) associated with the pattern was
applied (executed) and would then suggest a move. The addition of extra moves
to be suggested could easily be accomplished by the addition of new move <span
class=spelle>suggestor</span> rules or the addition of patterns. </p>

<p>The rules would supply a guess value (probable evaluation of the move),
bonus value, minimum aliveness value, and would indicate which groups were
being attacked or defended if any. The moves were sorted by their guess values
and, depending on playing level, a certain number were &quot;played&quot;.
Moves could be rejected before being evaluated if they did not
&quot;apply&quot;. A move applied if it accomplished what it was intended to
do: if a move was intended to defend a group and the group ended up weaker than
it started the move was rejected. Surviving moves were awarded a <span
class=spelle>sente</span> bonus if they achieved <span class=spelle>sente</span>.
The position resulting from the move was then evaluated. The evaluation score,
the <span class=spelle>sente</span> bonus and the rule bonus were summed
together and the highest scoring move was selected as the next move. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>After
a rewrite of the user interface and addition of professional graphics and new
features, Cosmos was released as The Many Faces of Go in 1990. Additions to MFG

increased. The pattern database was also improved by increasing the pattern
size from 5x5 to 8x8, by storing many suggested moves for each pattern in a
move tree (rather than just one per pattern as for Cosmos), and by a complete
rewrite which encompassed algorithms, code, and data structures and lead to an
increase in speed (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1996). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Data Structures <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
dynamic data describing a board position is stored in three classes of data
structures: incremental, locally recalculated, and globally recalculated. The
data in the incremental data structures is updated upon addition or removal of
a stone and includes low level information such as lists of empty points,
number of liberties etc. Locally recalculated data is updated as it is needed
i.e., it is only updated for regions of the board which have been affected by a
particular move or move sequence, and includes connection strength, and eyes.
Globally recalculated data is updated for the whole board and includes group
strength and influence. The locally and globally recalculated data structures
are maintained by the evaluation function. </p>

<p>The dynamic data is stored globally and is generated progressively in several
passes of increasing abstraction. The dynamic data used in MFG includes point
environment, string data, connection data, eye data, potential eye data, group
data, territory, and score. </p>

<p>An instance of the connection data structure stores information pertaining
to connectivity between two strings. Each connection has a list connection
points i.e., a liberty of one string which is no more than three points away
from the other string. Thus, the connection <span class=spelle>recognised</span>
by MFG include <span class=spelle>hane</span>, one point jump (<span
class=spelle>ikken</span> <span class=spelle>tobi</span>), knights move (<span
class=spelle>kogeima</span>), two point jump (<span class=spelle>nikken</span> <span
class=spelle>tobi</span>), large knights move (<span class=spelle>ogeima</span>),
three point jump, and bent three point. Other special connections near the
board edge are handled through the pattern database. The data stored in the
connection data structure includes the strings involved in the connection(s),
the number of and lists of one, two and three point connections (i.e., as
measured from the connection points), the type of each connection, and the
strength of each connection (e.g., already cut, <span class=spelle>cuttable</span>,
shared connection, connected with <span class=spelle>aji</span>, connected
solidly). Other than the type and strength data which is stored in a locally
recalculated data structure, the connection data is stored in an incremental
data structure. </p>

<p>The eye data structure records information pertaining to either a block of
empty point or dead enemy strings which are partially or completely enclosed by
friendly stones. Data stored in the eye data structure includes <span
class=spelle>colour</span>, a list of the points in the eye, vital points, and
eye type (e.g., one point, two <span class=grame>point</span>, line eye, big
eye, and dead group eye). The number of eyes (to a resolution of 1/8 of an eye)
achievable under various conditions were recorded including the number of eyes
if opponent moves twice, number of eyes if opponent moves next, and number of
eyes if program moves next. A board point can only be recorded as belonging to
one eye. The eye data structure is a locally recalculated data structure since
eye data does not lend itself to incremental update. In hindsight, <span
class=spelle>Fotland</span> says that a pattern based approach to recognizing
eyes would be preferable (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1993). </p>

<p>The evaluation of group strength and the generation of attacking and
defending moves <span class=grame>involves</span> identifying potential eye
space and running points. The potential eye data structure contains type, value
and location data for potential eyes. <span class=grame>An examples</span> of
data stored in the potential eye data structure is &quot;extend along
edge&quot; (type), value is number of new points of eye space, and location is
the liberty to extend from. Running points are stored by type (e.g., running
towards friendly/unfriendly stones) in several different lists. Potential eyes
and running points are stored in a globally recalculated data structure. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tactician <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Every
string with three or less liberties and many strings with four liberties are
read by the tactician. Each string is read twice, once with White moving first
and once with Black moving first. The tactician determines whether a string is
captured (i.e., can not live even if it moves first), threatened (i.e., it
lives if it moves first and dies if it moves second), or stable (i.e., lives
regardless of who moves next). The tactician relies on simple heuristics
concerned with the number of liberties and connectivity; pattern matching is
not used in the tactician. </p>

<p>The tactician has two separate move generators; one to generate attacking
moves and one to generate defensive moves. The moves suggested by the move
generators are sorted according to criteria which include second order liberties,
cut points, and simple eye shapes. Once sorted, an alpha-beta depth-first
search is employed with the performance of the search depending on the quality
of the move sorting (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm1 5 Mar. 1993). </p>

<p>Tactical searches are goal directed and are limited to a maximum number of
nodes. For string captures this is around 100, however, when only one move is
suggested, it is not counted towards the node limit. In this way, ladders can
be read without problems (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm1 14 Oct.
1993). The <span class=grame>number of nodes for a search are</span> allocated
to the branches according to the value given to the moves by the first ply move
generator and thus different branches may end at different depths. The
branching factor at each successive ply is progressively constrained by the
tactician. The branching factor falls from five at the first ply to one or two
by the fifth ply. </p>

<p>Since the data structures in MFG are separated into incremental, locally
recalculated and globally recalculated, low level local tactical searches can
be executed quickly by only updating the incremental data structures. However,
the possible goals of such a search are limited since the high level data
structures are not recalculated. It is not possible, for example, for MFG to
search for <i>x</i> liberties and two eyes (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>,
cgm1 3 Nov. 1993). </p>

<p>The tactician is used to read connections and eyes. A cutting stone can be
examined by the tactician to determine whether or not it will be captured.
Stones on the diagonal of eyes can be examined to determine whether they can be
captured. These types of search do not exceed around 12 ply since the program
actually plays worse if more plies are considered (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>,
1996). </p>

<p>MFG uses caching to reduce the amount of time spent reading. Since strings
are read twice, tactical results related to eyes, capture or threat, and cuts
are cached rather than re-evaluated. Life and death analysis are cached as
trees since they are smaller than the trees which would result from tactical
searches (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm4 16 Aug. 1994). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Influence Function <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
influence function radiates influence which is inversely proportional to
distance. Influence is radiated to a fixed maximum distance of nine although
when lower playing levels are chosen, the distance is smaller. Stones and
connection impede the radiation of influence. Black and White influence are
radiated separately (<span class=spelle>i.e</span>, they are not summed
together to give a single value for each board point) so that their relative
values can be compared. Dead stones radiate negative influence and thus, since
Black and White influence is maintained separately, dead stones reduce their
own influence rather than increase their opponents influence. The initial
influence value radiated from a stone depends on its strength. </p>

<p>Influence is not used to determine group connectivity. The use of influence
in MFG includes determining thickness and territory, identifying surrounded
groups, and generating <span class=spelle>moyo</span> building or reducing
moves. Another way in which influence is used is to determine a group's running
ability. A group's ability to run towards a liberty depends on the relative
values of friendly and unfriendly influence nearby. The sum of a group's
ability to run toward each of its liberties determines its running ability
whilst the gradient of the influence determines the direction in which it
should run. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Evaluation <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Board
positions are evaluated in a multiple pass process. The evaluation function
consists of many components which include the tactical <span class=spelle>analyser</span>
and evaluators for connections, eyes, group strength, and territory. A score
for the position being evaluated is achieved by assigning a value between -50
and +50 to each board point to indicate the level of Black or White control
exerted on them. The overall score for the board position is the sum of these
values for each board point. </p>

<p>In order to try and overcome the difficulties associated with the horizon
effect, <span class=spelle>Fotland</span> chose to use quiescent search rather
than modify the evaluation function. In quiescent search, positions are
evaluated when they become quiet rather than when they are in a state of flux
(e.g., such as in the middle of a piece exchange in chess). Positions which are
not quiet are <span class=spelle>characterised</span> by oscillations in the
evaluation values returned for successive moves which makes it difficult to make
good decisions based on the evaluations. MFG uses quiescent search as part of
the evaluation function for full board evaluation to overcome this problem by
either calling itself recursively (i.e., generating further moves) until a
position becomes quiet or by using patterns suggested as obvious local answers
to make the position quiet. MFG will generate up to six plies of moves in a
quiescent search which improves its performance by up to four stones (<span
class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm1 30 Sep. 1993). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Move Suggestion <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Moves
are suggested by a rule-based expert system and include <span class=spelle>fuseki</span>
(e.g. <span class=spelle>shimari</span>, <span class=spelle>kakari</span>, and <span
class=spelle>joseki</span> moves), moves on the edge (e.g., invasions and
extensions), playing in the centre, conservative play when ahead, risky play
when behind, pattern matching (e.g., cutting and connecting, surrounding and
escaping, invasion and <span class=spelle>defence</span>, endgame, killing and
saving groups, and shape-based moves), group defensive moves (e.g., making
eyes, running, and fighting <span class=spelle>semeais</span>), contact fights
(e.g., blocking, extending for liberties, and <span class=spelle>hane</span>), <span
class=spelle>ko</span> threats, and dame. </p>

<p>A limited form of full board <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> is achieved
by storing move sequences in the pattern and <span class=spelle>joseki</span>
databases. Move sequences attached to patterns in the pattern and <span
class=spelle>joseki</span> databases are played onto the board and evaluated at
their endpoints. <span class=grame>Thus if a particular </span><span
class=spelle>joseki</span><span class=grame> is suggested as appropriate, the
stones in that sequence are played and the resulting board position is
evaluated.</span> This enables MFG to &quot;play&quot; to the end of a <span
class=spelle>lookahead</span> sequence and <span class=spelle>minimax</span>
the score returned by the evaluation function for the resulting board position.
</p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pattern Database <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Each
pattern in the pattern database has <span class=grame>a</span> <span
class=spelle>a</span> move tree associated with it. The pattern database
contains around 1200 patterns of size 8x8 and around 6900 suggested moves with
the average number of moves stored for each pattern being about 5. </p>

<p>Each point in a pattern is marked as black, white, empty, white or empty,
black or empty, black or white, or anything (i.e., do not care). Patterns are <span
class=spelle>categorised</span> according to whether they are in the middle of
the board or whether they contain edges and/or corners. </p>

<p>A successful match of a pattern depends on both matching the stones in the
pattern with those on the board and matching any attributes associated with the
pattern. Each pattern has as many as 10 attributes which pertain to stones and
include whether they were dead or alive, minimum number of liberties, and
connectivity between stones. </p>

<p>To match over a 1000 patterns on a 19x19 board in 16 different orientations
requires around 3 million primitive operations. Since performance is a big
issue, the patterns are compiled into a bit array which facilitates fast
bit-parallel comparisons. By using an 8-bit hash function and bit-wise
operations, the number of primitive operations is reduced to around 350000.
This number of operations still takes enough time to make it too expensive to
match all patterns more than once per move. </p>

<p>Patterns from the pattern database are evaluated after being played on the
board in their entirety i.e., they are evaluated at the endpoints of their move
trees. A small subset of patterns are used to read local sequences based on
shape. <span class=spelle>Fotland</span> has recently begun evaluating the
strength of one point jump connection using patterns (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>,
1996). </p>

<p>A fast pattern matcher is necessary for a strong Go program according to <span
class=spelle>Fotland</span>. Pattern matching can be used to suggest and sort
moves, and to classify connections and eyes. <st1:city u2:st="on"><st1:place u2:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:city>
is employed to determine whether eyes are false. Pattern matching on its own is
not adequate for life and death and group strength determination (<span
class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm1 8 Apr. 1993). The eye and connection patterns
are hand coded decision trees. </p>

<p>One method that <span class=spelle>Fotland</span> tried to increase the
number of patterns in the pattern database was to take them from professional <span
class=spelle>games.When</span> replaying a professional game, if MFG didn't
consider the move played by a professional or the move played was low on the
suggestion list, <span class=spelle>Fotland</span> would manually cut-and-paste
an 8x8 section from the game into the pattern database using a self-written
graphics pattern database editor. <span class=spelle>Fotland</span>
discontinued this method since most of the missed moves were tactical (i.e.,
based on read-out not shape) or depended on a larger context than the 8x8 section
that was placed in the pattern database. <span class=spelle>Fotland</span>
found that the cut-and-paste approach to patterns was more profitable from even
games played on the IGS (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm1 13 Jan. 1994).

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
<span class=spelle>joseki</span> database contains around 45000 moves. <span
class=spelle>Joseki</span> sequences are stored as directed acyclic graphs
(i.e., they contain no loops) having empty corners at their roots. Moves in a <span
class=spelle>joseki</span> sequence can be one of several types including
urgent, complex, trick, and bad. The urgent <span class=grame>move have</span>
priority whilst the complex and trick moves are only played if MFG is behind.
The bad moves are not for the program to <span class=grame>play,</span> rather
they are used by the program to know how to respond to bad moves played by its
opponent. </p>

<p><span class=spelle>Joseki</span> patterns are evaluated by being played on
the board in their entirety and evaluating the resulting board position. MFG
selects <span class=spelle>joseki</span> sequences that are appropriate given
the status of the other corners (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1993). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Strategy <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>A
strategy function is used to focus attention on important areas of the board
before each move (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1993). The dynamic data is
examined to determine what phase the game is in, the relative score, the value
of taking <span class=spelle>sente</span>, and whether there are any urgent
offensive or defensive moves that need to be made. </p>

<p>Urgent offensive and defensive moves are examined initially and if
sufficiently urgent are played without any further considerations. Urgent moves
can be suggested by the pattern matcher or by examination of groups which are
determined to need urgent attention. Friendly groups which need urgent <span
class=spelle>defence</span> include big groups and cutting groups. Opposition
groups which need urgent attack include big groups, cutting groups, and groups
adjacent to friendly groups needing urgent <span class=spelle>defence</span>. </p>

<p>Move suggestion is affected by the phase that the game is in. Certain rules
will only fire in certain phases of the game. The <span class=spelle>fuseki</span>
phase lasts until <span class=spelle>joseki</span> sequences have been pursued
in all the corners. The middle game lasts until at least move 120 and MFG
enters the end game when there are no unsettled groups on the board. Transition
between middle game and end game phases may occur many times during a game. </p>

<p>The types of moves suggested are also affected by the relative score. MFG
plays more conservatively when it is far ahead of its opponent and makes
unsound invasions when it is far behind its opponent. The relative score is
classified into many states including &quot;way ahead&quot; (over 40 points),
&quot;ahead (20 - 40 points), &quot;about even&quot;, &quot;behind&quot; (over
10 points), and &quot;way behind&quot; (over 20 points). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Move Selection <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Since
the evaluation function is very slow (<span class=spelle>Fotland</span>, cgm4
16 Aug. 1994), a limit is placed on the number of full board evaluations which
can be performed each move depending on the playing level. MFG can only look at
5 to 10 moves in detail (depending on playing level) before selecting the move
it finally plays. A safeguard against errors in the evaluation function is that
only reasonable moves are suggested for full board evaluation (<span
class=spelle>Fotland</span>, 1993). </p>

<p>By employing the strategy function, the move suggestion expert system, and
the <span class=spelle>joseki</span> and pattern databases, MFG fully examines
a small number of moves, playing the one which receives the highest score from
the evaluation function. </p>

<p>The score returned from a full board evaluation is also modified by the
addition of <span class=spelle>sente</span> if applicable. Thus if MFG plays a <span
class=spelle>sente</span> move, the value of <span class=spelle>sente</span> is
added to the evaluation for the resulting position. The value of <span
class=spelle>sente</span> varies from 7 points during the <span class=spelle>fuseki</span>
to 1 or 2 points in the endgame and is determined by the strategy function. </p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>4.2.2 Go4++ <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
class=spelle>Micheal</span> Reiss started writing Go programs in 1983 and his
current program, Go4++, has evolved from various predecessors over that time.
Reiss has met with some success in computer Go competitions and Go4++ came 2nd
in both the 1st and 2nd FOST cups. </p>

<p>Reiss' programming philosophy is to use simple algorithms on a large amount
of data rather than complex algorithms on a small amount of data. Go4++
calculates everything from first principles; complex concepts are calculated
from simpler concepts which are in turn functions of even simpler concepts.
Thus, Go4++ does not have an elaborate rule-based expert system at its core. A
positive consequence of this approach is that Reiss' relatively weak ranking (2
<span class=spelle>kyu</span>) compared to other top Go programmers is not a
deficit. It also means that Go4++ usually responds well to the strange moves
(by human standards) that are quite often played by computer Go programs and
which are difficult to foresee when designing a rule-based system. The major
drawback of this approach is that it is computation intensive and requires a
powerful computer. </p>

<p>At the foundation of Go4++ is a massive amount of connectivity data from
which almost everything else is eventually derived. Go4++ selects a move by
first generating about 50 candidate moves that are analyzed by an evaluation
function which estimates territory. The move scoring the highest evaluation is
played as the next move. Thus, Go4++ uses 1 ply global <span class=spelle>lookahead</span>
although tactical <span class=spelle>lookahead</span> and search is used in
evaluating each move. </p>

<h2><a name=4.2.2.1><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>4.2.2.1
Candidate Move Generation </span></a><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Candidate
moves are generated by a process of pattern matching to determine the best 50
moves to examine in depth. Go4++ has around 15 high level patterns which
include terms for the probability of an eye, safety, and territorial value.
Whenever a match is made, the board point(s) suggested as good places to play
have an appropriate value added to them. The 50 highest scoring board points
are then examined by the evaluation function. The board point which receives
the highest score from the evaluation function is played as the next move. </p>

<p>In some circumstances, Go4++ effectively evaluates more than 50 candidate
moves per turn. Pattern matching is not applied to regions of the board where
the stone safety (see Stone Safety in section 4.2.2.2) and territory (see
Territory in section 4.2.2.2) do not differ from those of the previous move.
Thus after evaluating the 50 highest scoring board points after pattern
matching, the next move is selected from the combined set of evaluation scores
of the 50 board points just considered and the evaluation scores of any board
points in the undisturbed regions which were considered during the selection of
the previous move. </p>

Evaluation Function </span></a><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
evaluation function is a six step process: 1. a connectivity probability map is
generated, 2. groups are determined, 3. eye space is determined from which
individual eyes are identified, 4. the safety of each stone is determined, 5. a
radiation function combines the stone safety data and connectivity probability
map to radiate safety to empty points, and 6. territory is determined. Reiss
describes the evaluation function as pessimistic since whenever it is <span
class=grame>applicable,</span> the evaluation function considers that the
opponent is the next to move. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Connectivity
Probability Map <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Each
time a hypothetical move is played on the board, a connectivity probability map
for all friendly and opponent stones (including the hypothetical stone) is
generated and stored. The connectivity probability map for a stone contains the
probability of connecting to nearby friendly stones already on the board or to
an empty point if it was occupied by a friendly stone. Stones and empty points
which can be reached directly (<span class=spelle>nobi</span>), by a diagonal
move (<span class=spelle>kosumi</span> link), a one point jump (<span
class=spelle>ikken-tobi</span> link), a two point jump (<span class=spelle>nikken-tobi</span>
link), a small knight's move (<span class=spelle>kogeima</span> link), or a
large knight's move (<span class=spelle>ogeima</span> link) are examined (total
of 32 possible points). </p>

<p>The probability of connecting two stones is calculated empirically by
playing out the sequences of moves needed to determine whether the stones can
be connected or whether the opponent can cut them. This process requires the
use of <span class=spelle>lookahead</span>, particularly when ladders are
generated by cutting moves (e.g., cutting a <span class=spelle>kogeima</span>
link generates two ladders, one for each cutting point). If all possible
cutting stones are captured, then the probability of connection is 100%.
However, if the cutting stones can not be captured, a hand-tuned algorithm
estimates the connection probability. </p>

<p>A massive amount of data is generated in calculating the probability map for
each stone on the board for every hypothetical stone being evaluated. The
process is very computationally expensive and requires a powerful computer
(Go4++ currently runs on a Pentium-Pro 200). </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Group Determination
<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Stones
and strings are catalogued into groups: any stones which are 100% connected are
considered groups. A tactical search on all strings with less than 4 liberties
is used to determine which strings are definitely dead. Dead strings are not
included as part of any group. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Eye Identification <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Identifying
eyes is achieved in a two step process: 1. eye space is determined, and 2.
individual eyes are identified from the eye space. </p>

<p>A <span class=spelle>floodfill</span> type algorithm is used to identify
contiguous regions in which opponent connectivity probability is low. Points in
those regions whose 8 <span class=spelle>neighbouring</span> points are mostly
clear of opponent connectivity probability are considered to be eye space. </p>

<p>Individual eyes within a <span class=grame>groups</span> eye space are
identified by shape. There are several grades of eyes with the grade being a
function of the opponent's connectivity map. Eyes with a grade above a certain
level (see Stone Safety below) are considered to be true eyes. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Stone Safety <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
safety of each group is determined by the number of true eyes it has. The
safety process is repeated 5 times; each successive pass is more pessimistic
about which points will eventually become true eyes (i.e., the threshold is
raised for selecting which grade of eyes will eventually become true eyes). The
final safety value for a group is the average of its safety scores on each of
the 5 passes. </p>

<h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Radiation Function <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
safety value for each stone is radiated to the nearby empty points in
proportion to the connectivity probability map for that stone. The inverse of a
stones safety (100% - safety) is radiated in the same manner and contributes to
the opponents radiated value i.e., dead stones radiated full opponent safety.
Black and white radiation (including inverse radiation) is summed at each empty
point. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Reiss'
Go skill has progressed from 10kyu in 1987 to 4 <span class=spelle>kyu</span>
in 1992 to 2 <span class=spelle>kyu</span> in 1996. Reiss has programmed
full-time on Go4++ for about the last year (1996) and also programmed full-time
for one and a half years around 1986. Other than for these two periods since
starting Go programming in 1983, Reiss has programmed part-time with the most
effort usually expended in the two months leading up to a competition. </p>

<p>There have been many commercial releases of Reiss' programs by Oxford <span
class=spelle>Softworks</span> with another soon to follow. Notable releases
have been Go Player Professional and an updated windows version, Go
Professional II, released in <st1:country-region u2:st="on"><st1:place u2:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</p>

<p>Reiss characterized Go4++ as the weakest of the current strong programs at
tactical situations requiring life and death analysis although it is good at
creating <span class=spelle>moyos</span> and gaining territory in the middle
and endgame. Since Go4++ tends to play well in the centre of the board, Prof.
Chen played 200 games against Go4++ in an attempt to test modifications to <span
class=spelle>Handtalk</span> which were designed at playing better in the
centre. </p>

<p>According to Reiss, other weaknesses are the absence of global <span
class=spelle>lookahead</span>, lack of a concept of &quot;shape&quot;, and the
reluctance of Go4++ to invade. Since the evaluation function pessimistically
considers that the opponent moves next during tactical searches, Go4++ does not
usually evaluate the likelihood of invading stones forming eyes as being <span
class=spelle>favourable</span>. To compensate for not invading well, Go4++
always plays it first move at the 3<span class=grame>,3</span> point and also
tries to live in as many places as possible to stop its opponent creating <span
class=spelle>moyos</span> early. </p>

<p>Reiss uses many empirically hand-tuned algorithms within Go4++ although no
learning algorithms are used. Carefully crafted changes to these algorithms can
improve the strength of Go4++ e.g., by making the connection algorithm more
accurate, eye and territory evaluation also become more accurate, resulting in
an increase in playing strength. Before the 2nd FOST Cup in 1996, Reiss tuned
the performance of Go4++ by playing 700 test games against <span class=spelle>Handtalk</span>,
resulting in <span class=spelle>Handtalk's</span> only defeat during that
competition. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'><span
class=spelle>Handtalk</span> has been one of the strongest programs in recent
years and is written by <span class=spelle>Zhixing</span> Chen, a Chinese
professor from the <st1:place u2:st="on"><st1:placetype u2:st="on">University</st1:placetype>
of <st1:placename u2:st="on">Guangzhou</st1:placename></st1:place>. Although <span
class=spelle>Handtalk</span> becomes stronger each year and was awarded a 4 <span
class=spelle>kyu</span> diploma by the Nihon <span class=spelle>Kiin</span> in
1996, Prof. Chen does not believe that Go programs will reach <span
class=spelle>shodan</span> by 2000 if <span class=spelle>shodan</span> is taken
at its international level (2 - 3 <span class=spelle>dan</span> Japanese). </p>

<p>Details of the architecture and algorithms used by Prof. Chen are not
abundantly available. Some of the details which have emerged from discussions
that various people have had with <span class=spelle>Prof.Chen</span> at
various competitions are provided below. </p>

<p><span class=spelle>Handtalk</span> is written completely in IBM-PC assembly
language and is very small (around 250k) and very fast. Only a very small
number (around 4) candidate moves are evaluated using a static evaluation
function which seems to be accurate and stable. <span class=spelle>Handtalk</span>
also uses an influence function whose influence decreases as 1/2^distance. </p>

<p><span class=spelle>Handtalk</span> does not use very much global search.
Pattern matching is used to some extent although it is unclear whether the
patterns are contained in a database or if the pattern matching is rule-based. <span
class=spelle>Handtalk</span> does not use <span class=spelle>joseki</span> much
and has only about 10% as many <span class=spelle>josekis</span> as MFG. </p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>According to Prof. Chen, <span class=spelle>Handtalk's</span>
strong points are its fighting, group safety estimation, ability to recognize
life and death, the end game, and board evaluation. Other people have also
commented on its strength at estimating a group's running ability, sense of
shape, the middle game, and winning <span class=spelle>semeais</span>. Prof.
Chen characterizes its weaknesses as surrounding, <span class=grame>ko</span>,
and attacking territory. Recent changes include fighting less often than in
previous versions and an improvement in gaining territory in the centre which
was achieved by testing alterations in around 200 games played against Go4++. <a

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
Internet Go Server (IGS) provides a means for people to play real-time
interactive games of Go against other people or against Go programs over the
internet. The IGS serves as a virtual Go club which is particularly useful for
players who do not have local access to other Go players or a Go club. </p>

<p>First time users can login as &quot;guest&quot;. Full access can be gained
by registering for an account. Information about registering can be obtained by
typing &quot;help register&quot;. The help command provides information on how
to use the interface. Once logged on to the IGS, you can play a game against
another player, watch games in progress, or even comment on games in progress. </p>

<p>Interfacing to the IGS can be difficult and as a result, client programs
have been written for various platforms e.g. <st1:street u2:st="on"><st1:address u2:st="on">Atari
ST</st1:address></st1:street>, Amiga, <span class=grame>Macintosh</span>, NeXT,
MS Windows, IBM PC, Unix (ASCII) and X11. </p>

<p>Many individuals involved in the computer <span class=grame>Go</span> field
either for recreation, profit or research converse with each other via the
mailing list. The types of discussions vary from abstract to implementation
related. The mailing list is a good source for inspiration and new ideas,
information about approaches to programming Go that have been tried and have
failed, constructive criticism on ideas by others involved in programming Go,
information about tournaments and results, and much more. Archives of old and
current messages are also available. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Discussions
on the computer-go mailing list resulted in the establishment of an informal
competition between computer Go programs called the Computer Go Ladder. The
primary purpose of the ladder is for the enjoyment of the participants with the
secondary purposes of stimulating both interest and work on computer Go
programs and providing a way of measuring the state-of-the-art of current
programs. </p>

<p>There are HTTP links from the Computer Go Ladder page to pages related to
some of the programmers and some of the programs involved in the Computer Go
Ladder, world computer Go competition results, the IGS and various other
