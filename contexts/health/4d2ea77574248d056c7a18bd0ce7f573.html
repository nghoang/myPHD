Although difficult to express in dollar terms, another indirect cost of malaria is the human pain and suffering caused by the disease. Malaria also hampers children’s schooling and social development through both absenteeism and permanent neurological and other damage associated with severe episodes of the disease.</p><p>The simple presence of malaria in a community or country also hampers individual and national prosperity due to its influence on social and economic decisions.

In the 1960s and 1970s, substantial progress was made…. Most African governments increased spending on the health sector during this period. They endeavored to extend primary health care and to emphasize the development of a public health system to redress the inequalities of the colonial era.</p><p>… With the economic crisis of the 1980s, much of Africa’s economic and social progress over the previous two decades began to come undone. As African governments became clients of the World Bank and IMF, they forfeited control over their domestic spending priorities. The loan conditions of these institutions forced contraction in government spending on health and other social services.</p><p>… The economic austerity policies attached to World Bank and IMF loans led to intensified poverty in many African countries in the 1980s and 1990s. This increased the vulnerability of African populations to the spread of diseases and to other health problems.</p><p>... Declining living conditions and reduced access to basic services have led to decreased health status. In Africa today, almost half of the population lacks access to safe water and adequate sanitation services. As immune systems have become weakened, the susceptibility of Africa’s people to infectious diseases has greatly increased.</p><p>… Even as government spending on health was cut back, the amounts being paid by African governments to foreign creditors continued to increase. By the 1990s, most African countries were spending more on repaying foreign debts than on health or education for their people. Health care services in African countries disintegrated, while desperately needed resources were siphoned off by foreign creditors….

The introduction of market principles into health care delivery has transformed health care from a public service to a private commodity.

For example … user fees have actually succeeded in driving the poor away from health care [while] the promotion of insurance schemes as a means to defray the costs of private health care … is inherently flawed in the African context.

When infectious diseases constitute the greatest challenge to health in Africa, public health services are essential. Private health care cannot make the necessary interventions at the community level … is less effective at prevention, and is less able to cope with epidemic situations. Successfully responding to the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases in Africa requires strong public health care services.</p><p>The privatization of health care in Africa has created a two-tier system which reinforces economic and social inequalities….

A survey, in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that 62 per cent of the pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals “were either grossly misleading or downright inaccurate.”</p></blockquote><p class="source">— <cite>John Madeley, Big Business Poor Peoples; The Impact of Transnational Corporations on the World’s Poor, (Zed Books, 1999) pp. 145-146, 147</cite></p></div><p>The big pharmaceutical companies have caused enormous uproar in recent years when they have attempted to block poorer countries’ attempts to deal with various health crises. A vivid case is that of South Africa and cheaper generic drugs. The huge pharmaceutical association, PhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America), and other large companies had intensely lobbied the then US Vice President, Al Gore, in 1999, to <a href="/article/53/pharmaceutical-corporations-and-aids" title="Global Issues: “Pharmaceutical Corporations and AIDS”, Last updated: Sunday, June 02, 2002">threaten South Africa with trade sanctions for trying to develop cheaper, generic drugs to combat AIDS</a>. They claimed that World Trade Organization (WTO) rules regarding patents and intellectual property were being violated.</p><p>In fact, there was no violation. As problematic as the WTO rules have been in this area, there was provision in the rules allowing generic drugs to be created for emergency situations and public, non-commercial use. While public outrage managed to get such a move backed down, the underlying concerns from the big pharmaceutical companies have remained, and in various ways since, they have pressured the United States and other rich, industrialized nations to prevent other countries from doing similar things.</p><p>You can understand why the big companies are in fear. When CIPLA, one of India’s leading generics companies, offered a cocktail of anti-retroviral drugs for AIDS at $350 a year, compared to $10,000 from the multinational companies, this sent a shockwave in two ways. Poor countries realized they might have more affordable means to deal with a massive health crisis that afflicts them the most; and the large multinationals saw their monopoly prices severely threatened, and, exposed.</p><p>India’s patent laws have allowed the production of cheap generics. <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/06/18/love/index.html" title="External Link: Daryl Lindsey, 'The AIDS-drug warrior: Jamie Love', Salon.com magazine, June 1, 2001">CIPLA, for example, offered this low-cost price for their AIDS drug at a loss for itself</a>, because it said it made profits from other drugs, and this was something that was more than about profit and loss. However, India’s patent law has been under pressure from the rich countries for a long time now. Their patent laws were tightened up in early 2005, to come into line with WTO laws, thus <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/press/releases/indian_patents220305.htm" title="External Link: ‘New Indian patent law restricts access to life-saving medicine’, Oxfam, March 22, 2005">making cheaper alternatives less easy to produce</a>. This will not only impact India, but also a large majority of the world that looks to India’s generics industry.</p><ins datetime="March 26, 2006"><p>Furthermore, as <cite>Wired News</cite> reported at the end of 2005, India’s new patent laws somewhat ironically now enable <a href="http://wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,69595,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1" title="External Link: Scott Carney, 'Testing Drugs on India’s Poor', Wired News, December 19, 2005" id="id161000">pharmaceutical companies to test drugs on India’s poor</a> by using India’s cheaper, but highly skilled workforce to conduct drugs trials there, rather than in industrialized countries, thus saving significantly on the costs. However, as <cite>Wired</cite> also noted, this introduces a number of issues, such as:</p><ul><li>That although administrations in the industrialized countries, such as the Food and Drug Administration of the US, require that testing shows safety of the products, it is largely up to the country that hosts the trials and tests to ensure that procedures used have been sound and ethical. A developing country such as India does not have the ability to do this as effectively.</li><li>Furthermore, many drugs are being developed for markets in industrialized countries. Yet, using incentives such as $100 for participation (even though patients may not be fully aware of all the issues, which poses other ethical issues) in effect, poor people in other countries are being used for testing drugs on, while the potential benefits would be for people elsewhere. <cite>Wired News</cite> cited an assitant professor of medical history and bioethics, Srirupa Prasad, who said, “Third World lives are worth much less than the European lives. That is what colonialism was all about.”</li></ul></ins><p>Brazil too has found itself under pressure from the United States for producing cheaper generics. When its currency devalued in 1999, the case of Brazil also highlighted another issue: the high cost of imported drugs from the big pharmaceutical companies become even more costly as exchange rates fluctuate. Even though the dollar may be relatively weak currently, other rich countries where pharmaceuticals may be purchased from have currently got currencies that are stronger than the dollar.  Currencies of course fluctuate. The point is then, that the fluctuation makes it harder for poorer countries to forecast how much the drugs may cost. They, and any other country would be dependent upon price negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies, too.</p><p>On April 27, 2003, Britain’s Channel 4 aired a documentary titled Dying for Drugs. Noting that drugs bring billions to big pharmaceutical companies, and hopes to people, they asked, “how far would drugs companies go to get their drugs approved and the prices they want?” As the documentary said in their introduction, the implications are alarming and if their “power remains unchecked, many more people will soon will be dying for drugs.”</p><p>In Africa, the documentary showed how one of the world’s biggest drug companies experimented on children without their parents’ knowledge or consent. In Canada, it was revealed how a drug company attempted to silence a leading academic who had doubts about their drug. In South Korea, it followed the attempts of desperately ill patients to make a leading drug company sell them the drugs they need to save their lives at an affordable price. And, in Honduras they showed the brutal consequences of drug companies’ pricing policies whereby to save a 12-year old child dying from AIDS, people had to smuggle drugs from across the border, in Guatemala, breaking the law in the process, just to get the drugs at affordable prices. The child died while the documentary crew filmed the desperate smuggling.</p><p>Experts interviewed in the documentary also made some important points of note:</p><p>On the controversial high pricing for drugs, the documentary noted, “Big pharma generally defends high prices for new drugs … to cover costs for researching and developing new drugs. But in fact, most new drugs launched are just slight variations of existing medicines. So called Me Toos.” Nathan Ford, of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médicins Sans Frontiéres</cite> said, “At the moment we are getting more and more drugs of less and less use. Me Too drugs; the tenth headache pills; the 15th Viagra. There are currently eight drugs in development at the moment for erectile dysfunction. Do we need 8 more drugs for erectile dysfunction? I don’t think we do. Meanwhile diseases like Malaria, TB that kill 6 million people every a year, are neglected—no new medicines are coming out and we are left treating people with old drugs that increasingly don’t work.”</p><p>Markets for pharmaceutical companies are not just about finding people to target, but people <em>with money</em>. Dr. Jonathan Quick of the World Health Organization (WHO) added that the majority of the market for some of the tropical diseases is in developing countries but, “it’s a market in terms of numbers of people but the purchasing power is not there [and therefore] the normal dynamics of the research and development industry just don’t address those problems.”</p><p>In another example of how power was used, the documentary noted what happened in Thailand in 1990: the Thai government was making a number of generic drugs. They also wanted to make a generic AIDS drug. However, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened them with export tariffs on wood and jewelry exports, which made up some 30% of Thailand’s total exports. The Thai trade representative was very frightened and they stopped making the generic drugs. The U.S Secretary of Commerce threatened the South Korean Minister of Health in a similar way, but despite those threats, he continued campaigning for cheaper drug prices. He was later sacked. How do companies have such power over entire countries? Jamie Love, also interviewed in this documentary, suggested an answer:</p><div class="blockquote-with-source"><blockquote><p>Its because they not only can threaten not to make medicines available, but they can credibly threaten that the U.S. and Europe will impose trade sanctions on those countries and the financial markets will punish them for overriding the patent protection and hurt the rest of the economy. They can actually make the credible threat that if they don’t pay their price for their medicine you won’t be able to sell your products. You won’t be able to have jobs in the manufacturing sector. Your whole economy will suffer.</p></blockquote><p class="source">— <cite>Dying from Drugs, Channel 4, UK, April 27, 2003.

Created in 1994, medicines were included in its patent rules. Some of its rules had come under severe criticism from activists and developing countries.

Monopolies distort the economy. Restricting the use of medical knowledge not only affects economic efficiency, but also life itself.</p><p>We tolerate such restrictions in the belief that they might spur innovation, balancing costs against benefits. But the costs of restrictions can outweigh the benefits. It is hard to see how the patent issued by the US government for the healing properties of turmeric, which had been known for hundreds of years, stimulated research. Had the patent been enforced in India, poor people who wanted to use this compound would have had to pay royalties to the United States.</p><p>… The establishment of the World Trade Organization … imposed US style intellectual property rights around the world.

Drug companies spend more on advertising and marketing than on research, more on research on lifestyle drugs than on life saving drugs, and almost nothing on diseases that affect developing countries only.

However, one area where there was some success was in health issues. Slightly strengthened WTO TRIPS rules meant governments that could not afford branded drugs would be able to take measures to protect health a bit more easily by creating cheaper generics themselves, through “compulsory licensing.”</p><p>WTO patent rules still allow 20 years of exclusive rights to make the drugs. Hence, the price is set by the company, leaving governments and patients little room to negotiate—unless a government threatens to overturn the patent with a “compulsory license.” Such a mechanism authorizes a producer other than the patent holder to produce the product though the patent-holder does get some royalty to recognize their contribution.</p><p>Parallel importing is another potentially powerful mechanism available to poor countries. Effectively, it allows a nation to shop around for the best price for the same drug, which may be sold in many countries at different prices.</p><p>Compulsory licensing and parallel importing (in particular, parallel importing of generic drugs) are very effective tools to get prices down for developing countries. For example, the above-mentioned documentary noted that a drug in question had been offered in Brazil at dramatically reduced cost by Novartis themselves because of the threat that generic versions would have posed. (In the Europe Union (EU), parallel importing has been practiced for a while, though it is only on brand drugs and only amongst EU member states, so the benefits to patients of reduced prices appear more questionable. <span class="side-note" id="side-note-eu-parallel"><em class="h">Side Note</em><span>For more information on this, see for example: <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/newsAndEvents/archives/2004/EU_pharmaceutical_paralleltrade_update.htm">EU pharmaceutical parallel trade—benefits to patients?</a> from the <cite>London School of Economics</cite>, January 27, 2004; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=a.xcsl64Y1d0&amp;refer=europe">European Union should liberalize drug market, EU judge says</a>, from <cite>Bloomberg</cite>, April 18, 2005.</span></span>)</p><p>However, compulsory licensing laws in TRIPS imply that generics are only to be used for domestic purposes, not for export, and so parallel importing—which has been strongly resisted by the US and the pharmaceutical multinationals—was not part of the 2001 agreement. In reality, this means that given most poor countries do not have a sophisticated domestic pharmaceutical industry and thus would not have the ability to make their own generics, they would likely have to purchase the more expensive branded drugs.</p><p>At the next major WTO meeting, in Cancun, Mexico in September 2003, the developing countries managed to get another small win. But parallel importing may still prove difficult:</p><div class="blockquote-with-source"><blockquote><p>Developing countries successfully stopped the US and the pharmaceutical lobby from excluding many important diseases of the third world from the deal, which is an important achievement.

Oxfam, a prominent NGO, has been highly critical of the practices of big pharmaceutical companies, arguing that, “The U.S. Trade Representative is pursuing standards of patent protection which go far beyond WTO patent rules, and it is doing so regardless of the devastating impact that this could have on … developing countries.” Oxfam also believes the US is “pursuing this pro-patent agenda on behalf of its powerful pharmaceutical lobby, PhRMA.

The USA does this in a number of ways. It provides biased technical assistance in countries such as Uganda and Nigeria, which benefits its own industry by increasing drug prices and limiting the availability of generics, but reducing access. It uses bilateral and regional free trade agreements to ratchet up patent protection in developing countries. It has recently concluded free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore and is using the high intellectual property standards in the latter as a model for negotiations on the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas … and with Central American, Southern African, and other countries. And lastly, the U.S. bullies countries into increasing patent protection by threatening them with trade sanctions under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; nearly all those targeted are developing countries, including countries in compliance with their WTO obligations. The Costa Rican Pharmaceutical Industry estimates that the implementation of such TRIPS-plus patent rules would mean an increase in the cost of medicines of up to 800 per cent, because these rules would seriously restrict competition from generics.</p></blockquote><p class="source">— <cite><a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/health/bp56_medicines.htm">Robbing the Poor to Pay the Rich?

The US, as the international HIV and AIDS charity AVERT criticizes, prefers to go via its own PEPFAR (the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief).

The World Health Organization is worth quoting at length regarding this important shift:</p><div class="blockquote-with-source"><blockquote><p>However, broad global currents of macroeconomic policy change have strongly influenced health-sector reforms in recent decades in ways that can undermine such benefits. These reforms include encouragement of user fees, performance-related pay, separation of the provider and purchaser functions, determination of a package that privileges cost-effective medical interventions at the expense of priority interventions to address social determinants, and a stronger role for private sector agents. These have been driven strongly by a combination of international agencies, commercial actors, and medical groups whose power they enhance. The result has been on the one hand an increasing commercialization of health care, and on the other, a medical and technical focus in analysis and action that have undermined the development of comprehensive primary health-care systems that could address the inequity in social determinants of health.</p><p>Opening the health sector to trade, reform processes have split purchasers and providers and have seen increasing segmentation and fragmentation in health-care systems. Higher private sector spending (relative to all health expenditure) is associated with worse health-adjusted life expectancy, while higher public and social insurance spending on health (relative to GDP) is associated with better health-adjusted life expectancy. Moreover, public spending on health is significantly more strongly associated with lower under-5 mortality levels among the poor compared to the rich.

The sustainability of health-care systems is a concern for countries at all levels of socioeconomic development. Acknowledging the problem of sustainability in the context of a call for equitable health care is a vital first step in more rational policy-making, as is strengthening public participation in the design and delivery of health-care systems.

In addition, the effects of depression and social exclusion can become more profound. “About 14% of the global burden of disease has been attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders, mostly due to depression and other common mental disorders, alcohol- and substance-use disorders, and psychoses. The burden of major depression is expected to rise to be the second leading cause of loss of disability-adjusted life years in 2030 and will pose a major urban health challenge.” (pp.62-63)</p><p>Even the demands of increasing globalization has a health impact. For example, more people are working in informal sectors or part time. Increasingly influential transnational corporations are pushing for more labor flexibility to stay competitive. Reduced real income as people work longer hours and under more stress also means more health issues. Furthermore, some 487 million people (out of the 3 billion labor force) do not earn enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty (p.73).</p><p>Further, globally, it is estimated that there are about 28 million victims of slavery, and 5.7 million children are in bonded labor (p.74). And more than 200 million children globally aged 5-17 years are economically active.</p><p>When employment is coercive, exploitative, or accompanied by harsh/unfair conditions, established health and safety standards are less likely to be applied. If populations are becoming increasingly flexible while real incomes are reducing, these can all have a knock-on effect on health issues.</p><p class="top"><a href="#globalissues-org">Back to top</a></p></div></ins><div class="section"><h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2><p>Poverty exacerbates health issues. Under conditions of poverty, entities such as large pharmaceutical companies can wield even more power and influence over poorer countries. Some major reasons for unnecessary deaths around the world are therefore due to human decisions and politics, not just natural outcomes. Well-intentioned companies, organizations and global action show that humanity and compassion still exists, but tackling systemic problems is paramount for effective, universal health care that all are entitled to.</p><p>Addressing health problems goes beyond just medical treatments and policies; it goes to the heart of social, economic and political policies that not only provide for healthier lives, but a more productive and meaningful one that can benefit other areas of society.</p><p class="top"><a href="#globalissues-org">Back to top</a></p></div><p>(Image credit: health shield courtesy of <a href="http://www.devcom.com/">DevCom</a>)</p><!-- google_ad_section_end --><h2>Where next?</h2><div id="where-next"><p>Related articles</p><ol><li class="current">Global Health Overview</li><li><a href="/article/774/health-care-around-the-world">Health Care Around the World</a></li><li><a href="/article/218/diseases-ignored-global-killers">Diseases—Ignored Global Killers</a></li><li><a href="/article/219/aids-around-the-world">AIDS around the world</a></li><li><a href="/article/52/pharmaceutical-corporations-and-medical-research">Pharmaceutical Corporations and Medical Research</a></li><li><a href="/article/788/health-in-the-media">Health in the Media</a></li><li><a href="/article/53/pharmaceutical-corporations-and-aids">Pharmaceutical Corporations and AIDS</a></li><li><a href="/article/90/aids-in-africa">AIDS in Africa</a></li><li><a href="/article/533/tobacco">Tobacco</a></li><li><a href="/article/558/obesity">Obesity</a></li></ol><p class="see-more-related"><a href="#related-issues">See more related articles</a></p></div><div class="social-bookmarks"><h2>Share this page with:</h2><div class="group"><p>Bookmark or share this with others using some popular social bookmarking web sites:</p><ul><li class="facebook"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalissues.org%2Farticle%2F588%2fglobal-health-overview&amp;t=Global%20Health%20Overview">Facebook</a></li><li class="stumbleupon"><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalissues.org%2Farticle%2F588%2fglobal-health-overview&amp;title=Global%20Health%20Overview">StumbleUpon</a></li><li class="googlebookmarks"><a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/mark?op=edit&amp;bkmk=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalissues.org%2Farticle%2F588%2fglobal-health-overview&amp;title=Global%20Health%20Overview">Google</a></li><li class="delicious"><a href="http://del.icio.us/post?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalissues.org%2Farticle%2F588%2fglobal-health-overview&amp;title=Global%20Health%20Overview">del.icio.us</a></li><li class="digg"><a href="http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalissues.org%2Farticle%2F588%2fglobal-health-overview&amp;title=Global%20Health%20Overview">Digg</a></li><li class="reddit"><a href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalissues.org%2Farticle%2F588%2fglobal-health-overview&amp;title=Global%20Health%20Overview">Reddit</a></li></ul></div></div><div id="link-to-here"><h2>Link to this page from your site/blog</h2><div class="group"><p><label for="link-to-here-code">Copy/paste the following HTML code to your page:</label><textarea id="link-to-here-code" cols="30" rows="3">&lt;p&gt;Anup Shah, &lt;a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/588/global-health-overview"&gt;Global Health Overview&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Global Issues&lt;/cite&gt;, Updated: September 22, 2011&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></p><p>… to produce this:</p><p class="result">Anup Shah, <a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/588/global-health-overview">Global Health Overview</a>, <cite>Global Issues</cite>, Updated: September 22, 2011</p></div><div class="group"><p>Alternatively, copy/paste the following MLA citation format for this page:</p><p class="result">Shah, Anup. “Global Health Overview.” <cite>Global Issues</cite>. 22 Sep. 2011.
