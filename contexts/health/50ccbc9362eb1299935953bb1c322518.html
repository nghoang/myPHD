I get asked often about drug interactions, as a lot of patients are on more than 2 medications. One of the most interesting interactions is grapefruit juice!

<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-bound">A cancer biology team reports breakthrough findings about specific cellular mechanisms that may help overcome endocrine (hormone) therapy-resistance in patients with estrogen-positive breast cancers, combating a widespread problem in effective medical management of the disease.

It is being performed on increasing numbers of people worldwide, including teenagers. Unfortunately, some types of bariatric surgery may also cause bone loss, a cause for concern, particularly when carried out on young people who have not yet reached their peak bone mass, say endocrinologists who have just published a new review.</div>

I had been experiencing 10 years of difficult pre menopause symptoms and had grown several very large fibroids so I looked 6 months pregnant (not fun in my 50&#8242;s and already a grandmother!), and had experienced severe bleeding and increasing pain for a long time, which restricted my life intensely and caused me many embarrassing and difficult times despite medication.

<div class="entry-bound">Driving after a hysterectomy is not recommended for around six weeks, this is because the abdominal muscles play a key role in how we control the pedals, the brake and the steering wheel. If you cannot do an emergency stop, you will be uninsured to drive. When you are ready to try, it is a good idea to sit in the car and attempt manouveres such as the emergency stop and looking over your shoulder for reversing; this will tell you whether your abdominal muscles are ready to be tested on the road or not.</div>

<div class="entry-bound">I just thought that I would take this post (I know...I know...it has been a LONG time...) to talk about well, what is important to me...in my professional life. The whole reason I decided to go into cardiology was because I feel that there is a HUGE discrepancy among women and men with regards to heart disease. When polled, more women are afraid of dying of breast cancer (and believe that more women do die of breast cancer) than any other disease. FACT: More women DIE of heart disease than all cancers COMBINED. How many women in your life have heart disease? So, that's where I come in. I want&hellip;</div>

I get asked often about drug interactions, as a lot of patients are on more than 2 medications. One of the most interesting interactions is grapefruit juice! This is not only an often-asked interaction on our medical boards, but also a very important interaction for my patients to be aware of! Let's get to some details...

<div class="entry-bound">So, as many of you probably know by now...The reason I decided to become a cardiologist was mainly to help women. As I have stated time and time again, the public as a whole is undereducated about the prevalence of heart disease in women (its the #1 killer of us!) The American Heart Association has a wonderful campaign known as "Go Red for Women" which strives to educate the public about women's heart disease and how to prevent it. Seeing that this campaign is basically the entire reason for my career choice, it holds a special place in my heart. The red dress is a trademark of the U.S.</div>

The news is based on a study looking at the levels of various chemicals called carotenoids in men’s blood and their long-term risk of stroke. Carotenoids are naturally occurring chemicals which give fruit and vegetables their colour. They can act as antioxidants. Antioxidants are believed to help protect against cell damage from molecules known as &#8220;free radicals&#8221; and &#8220;singlet molecular oxygen&#8221;. Antioxidants are thought to work by reacting with an unstable molecule and bringing it under control.</div>
