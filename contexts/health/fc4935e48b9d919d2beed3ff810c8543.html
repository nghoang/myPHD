	<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/weight-of-the-world-bmi/">This interactive chart from the Washington Post</a> shows how the average body mass index has risen in most countries since 1980. The European men getting comparatively heavier than European women (against the general trend of the rest of the world) is interesting.

	<p><a href="http://healthmonth.com/">Health Month</a> is a game designed to help you improve your health.</p>
	<blockquote><p>There are about 50 different kinds of rules. Half of them are rules about what to avoid - things like alcohol, white flour, artificial sweeteners, and illegal drugs. And half of them are rules about what you do more of - things like exercise, sleep, greens, and multivitamins. Choose however many you like, and ignore the rest (you can always add more next month, right?). After choosing your rules, you have the option of making a promise to yourself about how to reward yourself if you stay in the game all month, or to build in consequences if you don't make it. It's all about self-accountability, in public. It works.</p></blockquote>

	<p>Well, we kinda knew that. But <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/phys-ed-the-men-who-stare-at-screens/">a recently published study indicates</a> that regularly sitting for long periods of time -- say, in front of a computer writing or programming or reading kottke.org -- increases your risk of heart disease even when you augment all that sitting with regular exercise. Yipes!</p>
	<blockquote><p>Men who spent more than 23 hours a week watching TV and sitting in their cars (as passengers or as drivers) had a 64 percent greater chance of dying from heart disease than those who sat for 11 hours a week or less. What was unexpected was that many of the men who sat long hours and developed heart problems also exercised. Quite a few of them said they did so regularly and led active lifestyles. The men worked out, then sat in cars and in front of televisions for hours, and their risk of heart disease soared, despite the exercise. Their workouts did not counteract the ill effects of sitting.</p></blockquote>

	<p>Pop quiz, hotshot. <strike>There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour...</strike> Who fares worst health-wise, diet soda drinkers or fried food eaters? Surprisingly, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/nutrition/05symp.html">researchers have found a correlation</a> between diet soda consumption and <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/metabolic%20syndrome/DS00522">metabolic syndrome</a>.</p>
	<blockquote><p>The one-third who ate the most fried food increased their risk by 25 percent compared with the one-third who ate the least, and surprisingly, the risk of developing metabolic syndrome was 34 percent higher among those who drank one can of diet soda a day compared with those who drank none.</p></blockquote>
	<p><a href="http://dihard.tumblr.com/post/26072439">What I Learned Today did some further digging</a> and found <a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20050613/drink-more-diet-soda-gain-more-weight">a different study that links diet soda consumption and obesity</a>.</p>
	<blockquote><p>For diet soft-drink drinkers, the risk of becoming overweight or obese was:</p><p>- 36.5% for up to 1/2 can each day<br />- 37.5% for 1/2 to one can each day<br />- 54.5% for 1 to 2 cans each day<br />- 57.1% for more than 2 cans each day.</p></blockquote>

For close mutual friends, the risk factor for transmitted obesity increased by 171%.</p>
	<p><b>Update:</b> Dr. Jonathan Robison <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=082107D">calls the above study "junk science"</a>. "How does one conclude a direct causal relationship from an observational study? Bald men are more likely than men with a full head of hair to have a heart attack. Can we conclude from this that they should buy a toupee or begin using Rogaine lotion to lower their risk?" (thx, robby)</p>
	<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/magazine/13contagion-t.html?pagewanted=all">Clive Thompson's NY Times Magazine article</a> (Sept 2009) covers this study in more detail. In addition to obesity, the study indicates that smoking, happiness, and drinking may be contagious.

	<p><a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/09.14/99-lifeexpectancy.html">A recent study concludes that in terms of life expectancy, there are eight different Americas, all with differing levels of health</a>. "In 2001, 15-year-old blacks in high-risk city areas were three to four times more likely than Asians to die before age 60, and four to five times more likely before age 45. In fact, young black men living in poor, high-crime urban America have death risks similar to people living in Russia or sub-Saharan Africa." If I'm reading this right, it's interesting that geography or income doesn't have that big of an impact on the life expectancy of Asians; it's their Asian-ness (either cultural, genetic, or both) that's the key factor. <a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&#038;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030260">Here's the study itself</a>.
