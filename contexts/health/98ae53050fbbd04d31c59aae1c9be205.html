<div class="entry-bound">Briana Dema, EWG Law Fellow EWG has joined several prominent environmental groups in filing suit against California regulators for failing to evaluate the impact of hydraulic fracturing operations in the state, as required by state law. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is used to extract oil and gas from geological formations by injecting large quantities of water, sand and chemicals deep underground under very high pressure. The technology has been linked to a wide range of environmental harms, including water contamination and air pollution. Recent evidence has also connected underground&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">By Jason Rano, Director of Government Affairs There is now solid evidence that Americans have gotten the message that the plastics chemical bisphenol-A, a synthetic estrogen that can disrupt the hormone system, is hazardous to their health. On September 26, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new biomonitoring data showing a sharp decrease in BPA in the bodies of Americans surveyed in 2009 and 2010, compared to those tested in 2003 and 2004.

The New York Times reported last month that uncertainty over whether hydraulic fracturing will be allowed in New York has significantly depressed real estate sales in the Catskills, because potential buyers fear that fracking could contaminate drinking water supplies, invite polluting industrial activity, and lower property values.

But as we also know, the elected officials on all of those flyers, calls and advertisements are going to decide some pretty critical issues. Like protecting us from toxic chemicals.

<div class="entry-bound">There is much argument over whether it is safe to compost biodegradable cat and pet litters. It comes down to the fact that some pet feces can contain organisms which are dangerous to humans. However, some experts say that it is safe to compost cat and dog litter if you compost it separately from the main compost heap and not near your vegetable garden. It is also suggested that you bury the feces, composting the litter only. Cat feces has been linked to potentially fatal toxoplasmosis, so many pet owners have avoided composting their litter all together.© 2008-2012 GreenLivingEveryday.com</div>
