The members of the state council shall receive no compensation for their services as members, but each shall be allowed the necessary and actual expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties under this section.</p>
<p>6. The commissioner, upon request of the state council, shall designate an officer or employee of the department to act as secretary of the state council, and shall assign from time to time such other employees as the state council may require.</p>
<p>7. No civil action shall be brought in any court against any member, officer or employee of the state council for any act done, failure to act, or statement or opinion made, while discharging his or her duties as a member, officer or employee of the state council, without leave from a justice of the supreme court, first had and obtained.

<h3><a name="BM3051"></a>Section 3051. Declaration Of Purpose.</h3>
<p>Emergency medical services provided to those suffering from sudden illness or injury have potential to reduce the incidence of disability and death and are therefore, invaluable. A training program of high quality is the key to assuring that emergency medical services personnel have the knowledge and skills to care for acutely ill and injured patients in a manner which will prevent further illness and injury. There is therefore a need to provide flexible, diverse and high quality training opportunities which are reasonably available, particularly to volunteers who devote considerable time, effort, and often personal resources, to improve or retain their knowledge and skills. The state has a responsibility to support and further the work of those who provide emergency medical care by providing needed instructional resources.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to expand and improve training opportunities for emergency medical service personnel, thereby benefiting all the residents of New York state who rely on the services of these personnel.</p>
<h3><a name="BM3052"></a>Section 3052. Establishment of a Training Program for Emergency Medical Services Personnel.</h3>
<ul class="nobullet">
<li>
<p>1. There is hereby established a training program for emergency medical services personnel including, but not limited to, first responders, emergency medical technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians and emergency vehicle operators.</p>
<p>2. The commissioner shall provide state aid within the amount appropriated to entities such as local governments, regional emergency medical services councils, and voluntary agencies and organizations to conduct training courses for emergency medical services personnel and to conduct practical examinations for certification of such personnel. The commissioner shall establish a schedule for determining the amount of state aid provided pursuant to this section.</p>
<ul class="nobullet">
<li>(a) Such schedule may include varying rates for distinct geographic areas of the state and for various course sizes, giving special consideration to areas with the most need for additional emergency medical technicians. In determining the need for additional emergency medical technicians, the commissioner shall use measurements such as the average number of emergency medical technicians per ambulance service, the ratio of emergency medical technicians per square mile, the average number of calls per service and the percentage of calls to which an emergency medical technician has responded, provided such data is available to the commissioner.</li>
<li>(b) Such schedule shall provide sufficient reimbursement to permit sponsors to offer basic emergency medical technician courses which adhere to curricula approved by the New York state emergency medical services council and the commissioner without the need to charge tuition to participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Upon request, the commissioner shall provide management advice and technical assistance to regional emergency medical services councils, county emergency medical services coordinators, and course sponsors and instructors to stimulate the improvement of training courses and the provision of courses in a manner which encourages participation. Such advice and technical assistance may relate to, but need not be limited to the location, scheduling and structure of courses.</p>
<p>4. The department is authorized, either directly or through contractual arrangement, to develop and distribute training materials for use by course instructors and sponsors, to recruit additional instructors and sponsors, and to provide training courses for instructors.</p>

<h3><a name="BM3061"></a>Section 3061. Declaration of Purpose.</h3>
<p>Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability during the first four decades of life. In the aftermath of the events of September eleventh, two thousand one, the medical response to natural and man-made disasters is also recognized as a public concern of the highest order.

Emergency medical, trauma, and disaster care, the planning and coordination of such care between prehospital and in hospital personnel and collaborating public health, safety, and welfare officials, the quality management and review of such care, and the development and maintenance of a statewide system for inter-facility transfer, including but not limited to aeromedical transport, of critically ill or injured patients between general hospitals and other health care facilities, are essential public health services. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for development and maintenance of systems for emergency medical, trauma, and disaster care, and for expeditious transfer of patients in need of such care to facilities appropriately staffed and equipped to provide this care in a timely and effective manner.</p>

<h3><a name="BM3071"></a>&sect; 3071. Declaration of Purpose.</h3>
<p>Sudden illness and injury in children within the state of New York are responsible for five percent of all ambulance calls in children under ten years of age, ten percent of all ambulance calls in children under eighteen years of age, twenty-five percent of emergency department visits in urban areas, and forty percent of emergency department visits in rural areas. More than fifty percent of all such emergencies are caused by traumatic injuries, which alone are responsible for more than half of all childhood deaths within the state of New York regardless of cause. The provision of timely and effective emergency medical services for children, including pediatric emergency medical, trauma, and disaster care, are therefore public health priorities of the highest order. It is the purpose and intent of this article to ensure that such services are immediately available to all children within the state of New York.</p>
<h3><a name="BM3072"></a>&sect; 3072. Description.</h3>
<p>Emergency medical services for children is a system for the immediate recognition and management of sudden illness and injury in children that embraces the continuum of pediatric emergency medical, trauma, and disaster care, from prevention through rehabilitation, and addresses emergency medical dispatch, prehospital emergency care, in hospital emergency care, and primary, secondary, and tertiary health care, in support of pediatric care provided within the child's medical home. It is not separate from, but fully integrated with, the emergency medical services system at all levels of emergency medical services system organization, in the community, in the region, and in the state.</p>
