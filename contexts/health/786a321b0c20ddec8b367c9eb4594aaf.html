      <p>Mental health refers to a human individual&#39;s emotional and psychological well-being. <!--del_lnk--> Merriam-Webster defines mental health as &quot;A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.&quot;<p>According to the World Health Organization, there is no one &quot;official&quot; definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how &quot;mental health&quot; is defined. In general, most experts agree that &quot;mental health&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> mental illness&quot; are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.<p>One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintain satisfying relationships, and lead an independent life; and being able to &quot;bounce back,&quot; or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.<p>Encompassing your emotional, social, and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;your mental well-being; All these aspects&mdash;emotional, physical, and social&mdash;must function together to achieve overall health.<p><a id="Determinants_of_health" name="Determinants_of_health"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Determinants of health</span></h2>

      <p>Nutrition is the <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> that studies how <!--del_lnk--> what people eat affects their health and performance, such as foods or food components that cause diseases or deteriorate health (such as eating too many calories, which is a major contributing factor to <!--del_lnk--> obesity, <a class="mw-redirect" href="../../wp/d/Diabetes_mellitus.htm" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Atherosclerosis.htm" title="Atherosclerosis">heart disease</a>). The field of nutrition also studies foods and dietary supplements that improve performance, promote health, and cure or prevent disease, such as eating <!--del_lnk--> fibrous foods to reduce the risk of colon cancer, or supplementing with vitamin C to strengthen teeth and gums and to improve the immune system.<p>Personal health depends partially on the social structure of one&rsquo;s life. The maintenance of strong social relationships is linked to good health conditions, longevity, productivity, and a positive attitude. This is due to the fact that positive social interaction as viewed by the participant increases many chemical levels in the brain which are linked to personality and intelligence traits. Essentially this means that positive reinforcement from a third party make one more socially adept, in control, and relaxed physically and mentally, all of which are proven to effect the nervous system(UHF).<p><a id="Sports_nutrition" name="Sports_nutrition"></a><h5><span class="mw-headline">Sports nutrition</span></h5>

      <p>Sports nutrition focuses on how food and dietary supplements affect athletic performance (during events), improvement (from training), and recovery (after events and training). One goal of sports nutrition is to maintain glycogen levels and prevent <!--del_lnk--> glycogen depletion. Another is to optimize energy levels and muscle tone. An athlete&#39;s strategy for winning an event may include a schedule for the entire season of what to eat, when to eat it, and in what precise quantities (before, during, after, and between workouts and events). Participants in endurance sports such as the <!--del_lnk--> full-distance triathlon actually eat <i>during</i> their races. Sports nutrition works hand-in-hand with <!--del_lnk--> sports medicine.<p><a id="Exercise" name="Exercise"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Exercise</span></h3>

      <p>Exercise is the performance of movements in order to develop or maintain <!--del_lnk--> physical fitness and overall health. It is often directed toward also honing athletic ability or skill. Frequent and regular physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of some of the <!--del_lnk--> diseases of affluence such as <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, <!--del_lnk--> heart disease, <!--del_lnk--> cardiovascular disease, <!--del_lnk--> Type 2 diabetes, <!--del_lnk--> obesity and <!--del_lnk--> back pain.<p>Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:<ul>
       <li>Flexibility exercises such as <!--del_lnk--> stretching improve the range of motion of <!--del_lnk--> muscles and joints.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aerobic exercises such as <a href="../../wp/w/Walking.htm" title="Walking">walking</a> and <!--del_lnk--> running focus on increasing <!--del_lnk--> cardiovascular endurance and muscle density.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anaerobic exercises such as <a href="../../wp/w/Weight_training.htm" title="Weight training">weight training</a> or <!--del_lnk--> sprinting increase muscle mass and strength.</ul>
      <p>Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy weight; building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and joints; promoting physiological well-being; reducing surgical risks; and strengthening the immune system.<p>Proper nutrition is just as, if not more, important to health as exercise. When exercising it becomes even more important to have good diet to ensure the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients whilst providing ample micronutrients; this is to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise. When the body falls short of proper nutrition, it gets into starvation mode developed through evolution and depends onto fat content for survival. Research suggest that the production of thyroid hormones can be negatively affected by repeated bouts of dieting and calorie restriction. Proper rest and recovery is also as important to health as exercise, otherwise the body exists in a permanently injured state and will not improve or adapt adequately to the exercise.<p>The above two factors can be compromised by psychological compulsions (<!--del_lnk--> eating disorders such as <!--del_lnk--> exercise bulimia, <!--del_lnk--> anorexia, and other <!--del_lnk--> bulimias), misinformation, a lack of organization, or a lack of motivation. These all lead to a decreased state of health.<p><!--del_lnk--> Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness can occur after any exercise, particularly if the body is in an unconditioned state relative to that exercise and the exercise involves repetitive <!--del_lnk--> eccentric contractions.<p><a id="Hygiene" name="Hygiene"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Hygiene</span></h3>

      <p>Hygiene is the practice of keeping the body clean to prevent infection and illness, and the avoidance of contact with infectious agents. Hygiene practices include <!--del_lnk--> bathing, <!--del_lnk--> brushing and flossing teeth, <!--del_lnk--> washing hands especially before eating, washing food before it is eaten, cleaning food preparation utensils and surfaces before and after preparing meals, and many others. This may help prevent infection and illness. By cleaning the body, dead skin cells are washed away with the germs, reducing their chance of entering the body.<p><a id="Stress_management" name="Stress_management"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Stress management</span></h3>

      <p>Prolonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, such as by weakening the immune system. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> negative effects of the fight-or-flight response.</i> Stress management is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. Certain <!--del_lnk--> nootropics do both. <a href="../../wp/p/Physical_exercise.htm" title="Physical exercise">Exercising</a> to improve physical fitness, especially cardiovascular fitness, boosts the immune system and increases stress tolerance. <!--del_lnk--> Relaxation techniques are physical methods used to relieve stress. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> sexual intercourse, <!--del_lnk--> progressive relaxation, and <!--del_lnk--> fractional relaxation. Psychological methods include <!--del_lnk--> cognitive therapy, <!--del_lnk--> meditation, and <!--del_lnk--> positive thinking which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills and abilities builds confidence, which also reduces the stress reaction to situations where those skills are applicable. Reducing uncertainty, by increasing knowledge and experience related to stress-causing situations, has the same effect. Learning to cope with problems better, such as improving problem solving and time management skills, may also reduce stressful reaction to problems. Repeatedly facing an object of one&#39;s fears may also desensitize the fight-or-flight response with respect to that stimulus -- e.g., facing bullies may reduce fear of bullies.<p><a id="Health_care" name="Health_care"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Health care</span></h3>
      <p>Health care is the prevention, treatment, and management of illness and the preservation of mental and physical well being through the services offered by the <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medical</a>, <!--del_lnk--> nursing, and <!--del_lnk--> allied health professions. According to the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a>, health care embraces all the goods and services designed to promote health, including &ldquo;preventive, curative and palliative interventions, whether directed to individuals or to populations&rdquo;. The organized provision of such services may constitute a <!--del_lnk--> health care system. This can include a specific governmental organization such as the <!--del_lnk--> National Health Service in the UK, or a cooperation across the National Health Service and Social Services as in <!--del_lnk--> Shared Care.<p>

      <p><i>Public health</i> is &quot;the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organised efforts and informed choices of society, organisations, public and private, communities and individuals.&quot; It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on <!--del_lnk--> population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a <!--del_lnk--> pandemic). Public health has many sub-fields, but is typically divided into the categories of <!--del_lnk--> epidemiology, <!--del_lnk--> biostatistics and health <a href="../../wp/s/Service_%2528economics%2529.htm" title="Service (economics)">services</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Environmental, social and behavioural health, and <!--del_lnk--> occupational health, are also important fields in public health.<p>The focus of public health intervention is to prevent rather than treat a disease through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors.
