<li id="text-288800051" class="widget widget_text"><h2 class="widgettitle">Mental Health Facts</h2>
			<div class="textwidget"><P>
From the <a href="http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/mental_health_facts/en/index.html"> World Health Organization</A>
<P>
About half of mental disorders begin before the age of 14. Around 20% of the world's children and adolescents are estimated to have mental disorders or problems, with similar types of disorders being reported across cultures. Yet, regions of the world with the highest percentage of population under the age of 19 have the poorest level of mental health resources. Most low- and middle-income countries have only one child psychiatrist for every 1 to 4 million people.
<P>
Depression is characterized by sustained sadness and loss of interest along with psychological, behavioral and physical symptoms. It is ranked as the leading cause of disability worldwide. 
<P>
On average about 800 000 people commit suicide every year, 86% of them in low- and middle-income countries. More than half of the people who kill themselves are aged between 15 and 44. The highest suicide rates are found among men in eastern European countries. Mental disorders are one of the most prominent and treatable causes of suicide.
<P>
War and other major disaster have a large impact on the mental health and psychosocial well-being. Rates of mental disorder tend to double after emergencies. 
<P>
Mental disorders are among the risk factors for communicable and non-communicable diseases. They can also contribute to unintentional and intentional injury.
<P>
Stigma about mental disorders and discrimination against patients and families prevent people from seeking mental health care. In South Africa, a public survey showed that most people thought mental illnesses were related to either stress or a lack of willpower rather than to medical disorders. Contrary to expectations, levels of stigma were higher in urban areas and among people with higher levels of education.
<P>
Human rights violations of psychiatric patients are routinely reported in most countries. These include physical restraint, seclusion and denial of basic needs and privacy. Few countries have a legal framework that adequately protects the rights of people with mental disorders.
<P>
There is huge inequity in the distribution of skilled human resources for mental health across the world. Shortages of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, psychologists and social workers are among the main barriers to providing treatment and care in low- and middle-income countries. Low-income countries have 0.05 psychiatrists and 0.42 nurses per 100 000 people. The rate of psychiatrists in high income countries is 170 times greater and for nurses is 70 times greater.
<P>
In order to increase the availability of mental health services, there are five key barriers that need to be overcome: the absence of mental health from the public health agenda and the implications for funding; the current organization of mental health services; lack of integration within primary care; inadequate human resources for mental health; and lack of public mental health leadership.
<P>
Governments, donors and groups representing mental health workers, patients and their families need to work together to increase mental health services, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The financial resources needed are relatively modest: US$ 2 per person per year in low-income countries and US$ 3-4 in lower middle-income countries.</div>

<p>Community activists, attorneys and civil rights workers told Portland&#8217;s City Council Thursday that the agreement the city reached with federal officials on police reforms doesn&#8217;t go far enough.</p>
<p>They urged the council to slow down and not rush to sign <a href='http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EXHIBIT-A_US-DOJ-CITY-PPB-Settlement-Agreement.pdf'>the 74-page agreement next week</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_17279" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 380px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Steenson.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Steenson.jpg" alt="Tom Steenson, a Portland civil rights attorney, told the Portland City Council it should not sign an agreement between the city and the Department of Justice until some changes are made." title="Tom Steenson, a Portland civil rights attorney, told the Portland City Council it should not sign an agreement between the city and the Department of Justice until some changes are made." width="380" height="252" class="size-full wp-image-17279" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tom Steenson, a Portland civil rights attorney, told the Portland City Council it should not sign an agreement between the city and the Department of Justice until some changes are made.</p></div>
<p>Civil rights attorney <strong>Tom Steenson</strong>, who represented the families of <strong>James P. Chasse Jr.</strong> and <strong>Aaron Campbell</strong> in federal lawsuits against the city, said he could not understand why several recommended changes to police practices were rejected. He said the agreement lacks several &#8220;best practices&#8221; governing police training and accountability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t approve the agreement as it stands,&#8221; Steenson told the council. &#8220;I think that you need to step back and look at this and give much more consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rev. <strong>T. Allen Bethel</strong>, of the Albina Ministerial Alliance, said the lack of real community involvement has continued to erode the community&#8217;s trust that the reforms in the agreement will be put in place.</p>
<p>Bethel and others urged an independent court-appointed monitor to be assigned to oversee the changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement needs to be relooked at, renegotiated and needs to come back with teeth,&#8221; Bethel said.</p>
<p>The agreement was announced last Friday, more than a month after the U.S. Department of Justice found the Police Bureau engages in a pattern or practice of excessive force against people with mental illness. The agreement contains changes to bureau policies on use of force, its training of officers, retention of records, and community oversight.</p>
<p><strong>Becky Straus</strong>, of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, said the council has an opportunity &#8220;to achieve lasting change&#8221; in the Police Bureau.</p>
<p>But she said she worries that there&#8217;s not enough oversight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to be concerned that there is not enough accountability to ensure that what is mandated will ever be actualized,&#8221; the ACLU&#8217;s written testimony says. &#8220;We are disappointed that the Agreement stops short of this necessary safeguard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several members of the city&#8217;s Human Rights Commission decried the agreement&#8217;s dismantling of the Community Police Relations Committee, which would be replaced by a 15-voting member Community Oversight Board to ensure the DOJ reforms are put in place.<br />
<strong><br />
Kyle Busse</strong>, chair-elect of the Human Rights Commission, said he&#8217;s concerned that the important work of improving race relations by the Community Police Relations Committees would be jeopardized.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a surprise to learn they&#8217;d be uprooted and be put in a position they knew nothing about,&#8221; Busse said.</p>
<p>ACLU representatives, the League of Women Voters and Portland Copwatch argue the agreement didn&#8217;t go far enough in improving the existing police accountability system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Department of Justice letter of findings called Portland&#8217;s accountability system &#8216;self defeating.&#8217; Unfortunately, the remedies outlined in the agreement do little to address many of the long-standing community concerns related to the system as it currently operates,&#8221; wrote <strong>Mary McWilliams</strong>, league president, and <strong>Debbie Aiona</strong>, the league&#8217;s action committee chair, in a letter to the mayor and commissioners.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon also had recommended that the city abandon the current police oversight system involving the Independent Police Review Division and replace it with a &#8220;strong, transparent, and integrated civilian oversight body.&#8221;<br />
<strong><br />
Angela Kimball</strong>, a member of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, urged the Police Bureau to hire a national consultant, such as retired Memphis police Major <strong>Sam Cochran</strong>, to help the bureau recreate a specialized Crisis Intervention Team of officers that work closely with mental health providers and consumers.</p>
<p>Kimball urged the city commissioners to show true leadership to bring about the reforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real reform can&#8217;t be decreed by a legal document,&#8221; Kimball told the council, &#8220;but only by your sustained commitment and leadership to bring the culture of the Police Bureau in line with city mores.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>James Kahan</strong>, a volunteer member of of the bureau&#8217;s Crisis Intervention Team advisory council, said he was struck by many of the agreement&#8217;s demands that the bureau bring back a voluntary group of specialized officers to respond to mental health crisis calls and reconnect with community providers and mental health consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been making them (recommendations) for years and we&#8217;ve been ignored,&#8221; Kahan said.</p>
<p>Busse, of the Human Rights Commission, said the council should not rush into the agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the time to do it right,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The mayor estimated that the annual cost of the reforms will be $5.4 million – 60 percent of that or $3.5 million is from an increase of 32 staff positions , and 40 percent represents the ongoing funding of the city&#8217;s Service Coordination Team, which connects frequent offenders with housing and treatment.</p>
<p>If the council wants to make any changes to the settlement agreement, city officials would have to have the buy-in of the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Once the three-hour hearing came to a close, the mayor said the City Council would hold another hearing next Thursday afternoon on potential amendments to the Justice Department agreement but would not vote next week.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/11/new_mental_health_center_key_t.html">From The Oregonian, 11/2/2012</a></p>
<p>When Portland&#8217;s mayor last week announced the city&#8217;s plan to address federal concerns about police treatment of people in mental health crisis, he highlighted a key feature: a drop-off or walk-in center where police could take patients in need. He said a center would open in mid-2013.</p>
<div id="attachment_17275" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 380px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Mayor-Sam-Adams-on-Oct.-26-announcing-a-negotiated-settlement-in-U.S.-Justice-Department-inquiry-into-police-use-of-force-against-people-with-mental-illness..jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Mayor-Sam-Adams-on-Oct.-26-announcing-a-negotiated-settlement-in-U.S.-Justice-Department-inquiry-into-police-use-of-force-against-people-with-mental-illness..jpg" alt="Mayor Sam Adams on Oct. 26, announcing a negotiated settlement in U.S. Justice Department inquiry into police use of force against people with mental illness." title="Mayor Sam Adams on Oct. 26, announcing a negotiated settlement in U.S. Justice Department inquiry into police use of force against people with mental illness." width="380" height="338" class="size-full wp-image-17275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mayor Sam Adams on Oct. 26, announcing a negotiated settlement in U.S. Justice Department inquiry into police use of force against people with mental illness.</p></div>
<p>But the issue is far from settled. Leaders of the health care organizations that Mayor Sam Adams said would open the centers say they haven&#8217;t ironed out what one would look like, where it would be, how it would be funded or even whether such a facility is the best solution. Multnomah County officials say they were not involved in any talks. And other mental health providers called the deadline unrealistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;How this effort will be funded is a good question, and we don&#8217;t have an answer to that right now,&#8221; said <strong>Janet L. Meyer</strong>, interim chief executive office of Health Share of Oregon.</p>
<p>Health Share is one of the state&#8217;s two new coordinated care organizations for Multnomah County &#8212; a network of health care providers to serve people under the Oregon Health Plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;To have something as complex as a drop-off center organized, established and operational by mid-2013 seems, quite frankly, beyond what would be considered possible,&#8221; said <strong>Derald Walker</strong>, chief executive officer of Cascadia Behavioral Healthcare.</p>
<p>Written into Portland&#8217;s negotiated agreement with federal justice officials is the expectation by the U.S. Department of Justice that the state&#8217;s new local coordinated care organizations will create one or more of the centers for people in need of immediate mental health care by mid-2013.</p>
<p>Meyer said her management team worked closely with the mayor to assist in Portland&#8217;s response to the Justice Department inquiry. The team&#8217;s role, she said, was providing background information.</p>
<p>&#8220;We agreed that if the outcome of our work indicates a need for a drop off center, then it would be incumbent on everyone &#8212; Health Share, FamilyCare and the county mental health authority &#8212; to facilitate the creation of such a facility.&#8221;</p>
<p>She called next year&#8217;s deadline &#8220;a challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Gamez</strong>, chief operating officer for FamilyCare Inc., said Thursday he had talked with the mayor by phone before the Justice Department agreement was released, but doesn&#8217;t know where the mid-2013 deadline came from.</p>
<p>Gamez described the opening of a crisis drop-off center as &#8220;one of the options&#8221; where police might take people in need of immediate mental health care. &#8220;To me, it&#8217;s unclear how the funding stream is going to occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are there to partner with the city. We are going to be involved in the process moving forward,&#8221; Gamez said.</p>
<p>Multnomah County spokesman <strong>David Austin</strong> said county mental health providers have been involved with the city in &#8220;broad-based&#8221; discussions on how to improve the mental health-care system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not involved in any plans or discussions with the city or CCOs around building new drop-off centers,&#8221; Austin said. &#8220;We were not a party to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, Portland police have lamented the 2003 closing of the Crisis Triage Center at Providence Medical Center, where officers could drop off someone they encountered during a call who needed immediate mental health care.</p>
<p>But the triage center quickly became overrun with patients. And, despite the center&#8217;s ability to keep patients on mental health holds up to 72 hours, patients often were let out after that period. Budget cuts closed the center.</p>
<p>After the 2006 death in Portland police custody of <strong>James P. Chasse Jr.</strong>, a 42-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia, the city and county moved to open a new, 16-bed Crisis Assessment Treatment Center. The Portland Development Commission provided $2 million for development, and the state contributed $1 million to renovate the second floor of the David P. Hooper Sobering Center for the new center.</p>
<p>The center opened in June 2011 off Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Its staff provides patients up to 10 days of assessment and treatment, and develops a treatment plan for after they leave the center. Police, hospital ER staff or mental health care providers can refer patients by calling the county&#8217;s Mental Health Call Center. But the Crisis Assessment and Treatment Center is not a &#8220;drop-off&#8221; center for anyone who wants services.</p>
<p>Oregon&#8217;s U.S. Attorney <strong>Amanda Marshall</strong> said that before the federal-city agreement was reached, she had attended a brief meeting with the mayor, Central City Concern, hospital officials and other community-based health care groups. &#8220;We discussed the need to have the private sector come together to work with the city and state,&#8221; on mental health care reforms, Marshall said. But any details about deadlines or drop-off centers were negotiated by the mayor, Marshall said.</p>
<p>Adams and Commissioner<strong> Amanda Fritz</strong> said the mid-2013 deadline came from their talks with coordinated care organization representatives over the past several months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything in that agreement regarding the drop-off centers, they agreed to,&#8221; Adams said Thursday.</p>
<p>But the mayor and Fritz said no details on location or funding have been ironed out. Adams said those questions would be answered by a coordinated care organization-subcommittee that includes city and county representatives. &#8220;Having us at the table redesigning mental health community services is key,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Fritz added, &#8220;We think it&#8217;ll end up being cheaper to take care of people in crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor said his early conversations with community-based health care organizations suggested it would take 18 to 24 months before the CCO &#8220;could get to local mental health service reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At my request, I am very grateful they moved it up to mid-2013,&#8221; Adams said.</p>
<p>Walker isn&#8217;t convinced the mayor&#8217;s timeline is achievable for a drop-off center. &#8220;As much as we would like to have something like that set up&#8221; he said, &#8220;that strikes me as overly ambitious.&#8221;</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/but-does-it-have-teeth/Content?oid=7444138">From the Portland Mercury, October 31, 2012</a></p>
<p>Building on last month&#8217;s federal report that blasted Portland cops&#8217; use of unconstitutional force against the mentally ill, the US Department of Justice and city officials last Friday, October 26, reached accord on a &#8220;watershed&#8221; set of reforms bearing big promises—but even bigger questions.</p>
<p>The agreement aims to expand civilian oversight of the police bureau, strengthen mental health treatment and training, tighten Taser and use-of-force policies, and speed up misconduct investigations.</p>
<div id="attachment_17249" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 248px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chales.jpeg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chales-248x300.jpeg" alt="Charlie Hales by Catlin Gabel student Emmy Foster" title="Charlie Hales by Catlin Gabel student Emmy Foster" width="248" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-17249" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlie Hales by Catlin Gabel student Emmy Foster</p></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a watershed moment,&#8221; Mayor <strong>Sam Adams</strong> said. &#8220;We are fully embracing the responsibilities we have and the realities we face.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that landmark moment comes with a major price tag that Adams doesn&#8217;t yet know how he&#8217;ll pay: $3.5 million in annual costs for dozens of new positions—cheaper than in cities like New Orleans and Seattle, but a tough sum to absorb in a city facing budget cuts.</p>
<p>The deal also leaves much of the implementation to Portland&#8217;s next police commissioner. And advocates who have been tracking civil rights issues for years already are asking whether the deal actually addresses the problems laid out by the feds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t solve my problem at all,&#8221; says <strong>Jason Renaud</strong> of the Mental Health Association of Portland, who wrote to the feds asking why the agreement doesn&#8217;t include stronger provisions for firing cops who use excessive force. &#8220;There are police officers on the streets who have killed my friends. And they&#8217;re likely to kill again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some changes, however, will happen quickly. Portland City Council is set to approve the reforms at a 2 pm hearing this Thursday, November 1. Then, the council will immediately seek out applicants to serve as a new city compliance officer—someone charged with making sure the city delivers on its promises while also leading a 15-member community oversight board (of which five members would be nominated citywide).</p>
<p>That person will not serve as a monitor with court-bestowed powers, officials say. Rather, he or she will report quarterly to the feds and to the public on how well the city is holding up its end of the bargain.</p>
<p>The police bureau also must begin sifting through several changes in training, policy, and oversight, including:</p>
<p>• Creating an Addictions and Behavioral Health Unit that will have power over a restored Crisis Intervention Team of specially trained mental health officers and oversee an expansion of the bureau&#8217;s mobile crisis units.</p>
<p>• How to wrap up misconduct investigations, including appeals, within 180 days—far shorter than the current year-plus average. The police bureau&#8217;s Internal Affairs division and the city&#8217;s Independent Police Review division are both expected to nearly double their teams of investigators.</p>
<p>• Changing Taser policies to ban the use of multiple stun guns on the same person at the same time. Cops will be also banned from using consecutive Taser cycles on someone—a change long sought by advocates.</p>
<div id="attachment_17251" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 248px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jsmith.jpeg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jsmith-248x300.jpeg" alt="Jefferson Smith by Catlin Gabel student Emmy Foster" title="Jefferson Smith by Catlin Gabel student Emmy Foster" width="248" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-17251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jefferson Smith by Catlin Gabel student Emmy Foster</p></div>
<p>Another key element required a buy-in, not only from the feds and the cops, but also the city&#8217;s health care industry. The state&#8217;s Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs), tasked with implementing federal health care reform in Oregon, have promised to add, by mid-2013, at least one center where cops can drop off people in crisis.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s sooner, Adams explained, than the CCOs otherwise would have moved. CCOs also will work with the city and Multnomah County to improve treatment in clinics and emergency rooms.</p>
<p>The city has at least five years to make the fixes. But skeptics, including <strong>Dan Handelman</strong> of Portland Copwatch, worry the city will skirt some of the more substantive reforms through the use of loopholes.</p>
<p>He lamented that Police Review Board hearings, which greatly inform discipline decisions by the chief&#8217;s office, remain closed to the public. Discipline, or a lack thereof, in deadly force cases still can&#8217;t be appealed. And he cited a change that would ban any cop rapped for the use of force in a three-year period from training other officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police want to find ways to keep doing what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Handelman says. &#8220;Nobody ever gets found guilty of use of force. They are accused, but it&#8217;s rare someone gets found out of policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both mayoral candidates, <strong>Charlie Hales</strong> and <strong>Jefferson Smith</strong>, have indicated—Hales explicitly so—that they&#8217;ll keep Police Chief <strong>Mike Reese</strong>. Both also tell the Mercury they&#8217;ll be willing to make deep cuts at city hall while also looking to Multnomah County for help with funding.</p>
<p>But Smith appears more willing to play a bit rough if either the cops or the health care system refuse to fall in line. He says he&#8217;d hold up permits and zoning approvals for the CCOs if they didn&#8217;t work with the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since this is a federal agreement and the department of justice has also investigated our state mental health system,&#8221; Smith says, &#8220;the CCOs also have an incentive to live up to their end of the deal, lest they face greater scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he also said he&#8217;d take action if, for example, the benchmarks for speedier misconduct probes aren&#8217;t met.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question of a special [court-appointed] monitor,&#8221; Smith says, &#8220;might need to be revisited.&#8221;</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.registerguard.com/web/news/cityregion/28964976-41/ashe-prison-aiken-federal-state.html.csp">From the Eugene Register-Guard, October 30, 2012</a></p>
<p>A 48-year-old man with a long history of mental illness was sentenced Monday to more than 12? years in federal prison — as he had requested — for robbing a Eugene bank hours after his release from state prison in January.</p>
<div id="attachment_17238" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 422px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Adam-Parrish-Ashe.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Adam-Parrish-Ashe.jpg" alt="Adam Parrish Ashe" title="Adam Parrish Ashe" width="422" height="548" class="size-full wp-image-17238" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Adam Parrish Ashe</p></div>
<p><strong>Adam Parrish Ashe</strong> asked U.S. District Judge <strong>Ann Aiken</strong> to “do us all a favor” by imposing the sentence, saying he needed the structure of prison and “maybe I’d get some help there.”</p>
<p>Aiken said society “should be absolutely appalled” that prison has become the only option for the mentally ill.</p>
<p>“Shame on us,” she said. “I hope for the sake of other people that what you’ve said today will be heard.”</p>
<p>Defense attorney<strong> Bryan Lessley</strong> said he recommended reluctantly that Aiken impose the sentence because of his client’s concerns “for his own security and safety.”</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney <strong>Jeffrey Sweet</strong> sought the same penalty “not out of a desire to punish Mr. Ashe, but out of a desire to protect the public.”</p>
<p>Both the government and Lessley had expected Ashe to be committed to the custody of the Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board in connection with an arson fire that led to his state prison sentence, Sweet said Monday.</p>
<p>Both federal and state prosecutors had jurisdiction in that May 26, 2009, incident because it was a U.S. Post Office in Roseburg where Ashe broke a window, entered and started a fire in a wastebasket with a propane torch.</p>
<p>A police officer removed the burning can before the fire could damage the building, but Ashe reportedly started the fire because he was angry with the federal government.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office dismissed the federal case, however, after Lessley filed notice that he intended to pursue a “guilty but for insanity defense” to the state court arson charge. Had an Oregon State Hospital psychiatric evaluation shown that Ashe was incapacitated by mental illness, he could have been committed to the authority of the Psychiatric Security Review Board for 20 years.</p>
<p>Persons under the board’s jurisdiction can be housed in the state hospital or a variety of residential treatment settings.</p>
<p>But Ashe’s evaluation determined that he was “malingering” — feigning symptoms — and he was instead sentenced in September 2011 to 23 months in state prison, with credit for time served in jail since his arrest. That led to his release from prison just four months later.</p>
<p>State corrections officials put him on a bus with instructions to report to a Roseburg parole office, Aiken said Monday.</p>
<p>Instead, Ashe got off the bus in Eugene, walked to Home Federal Bank at 899 Pearl St. and gave a teller a note demanding money, falsely stating that he had a gun. Ashe left behind his prison identification card when he walked out with the cash. He was arrested minutes later, telling police he wanted to go back to prison. All the money was recovered.</p>
<p>Lessley and Sweet both told Aiken they believed Ashe to be genuinely mentally ill. If he was feigning symptoms, the defense attorney said, he’d been doing it since at least age 18.</p>
<p>Aiken then read aloud portions of a confidential history submitted by Lessley. She noted that Ashe had 10 separate psychiatric hospitalizations in South Carolina between 1982 and 1990. The first came when Ashe was 18.</p>
<p>His mother reported that her son’s hallucinations included “20-foot snakes” and that he was sniffing Liquid Paper. A Minnesota Social Security disability board in 1994 declared Ashe disabled by severe major depression and alcohol-related dementia, noting that he suffered auditory hallucinations and had made multiple suicide attempts.</p>
<p>After he came to Oregon, a police officer once found Ashe “sitting in fire” he’d ignited.</p>
<p>Ashe told Aiken he robbed the bank because he saw no other options.</p>
<p>“The only way that I can see getting any help is to escalate in my criminal behavior simply to get some more time in prison with time for my own reflections,” he told Aiken, later adding that he’s afraid of going to prison but “even more terrified of what I’m becoming in society.”</p>
<p>Aiken criticized the Oregon prison system for failing to provide structure for Ashe upon his release.</p>
<p>“It’s not good public safety to just lock you up and have no place when you come out,” she said.</p>
<p>Aiken recommended that he serve his sentence at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Missouri or in a mental health program at Oregon’s Sheridan Federal Correctional Institution. She also pledged that the federal court would provide better re-entry services when Ashe completes his new sentence.</p>

				<p>READ &#8211; <a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EXHIBIT-A_US-DOJ-CITY-PPB-Settlement-Agreement.pdf">DOJ &#8211; City of Portland Settlement</a>, to be voted on by Portland City Council 11/1/12, 2 PM<br />
READ &#8211; <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=50265&#038;a=418205">Proposed city ordinance accepting settlement with DOJ</a>  </p>
<p>To <strong>Thomas Perez</strong>, U.S. Department of Justice:</p>
<p>The settlement offer distributed on October 27 may resolve differences between the city of Portland and the federal government, but from our point of view &#8212; that of persons with mental illness, those actually subject to the “pattern and practice” identified in your original report, those most likely to be harmed by police officers &#8212; there is little in the document which provides immediate reassurance.</p>
<p>Foremost, the city continues to employ officers who have mercilessly and thoughtlessly killed our friends without consequence.  The settlement introduces no mechanism to separate those individuals from the police bureau, in order to prevent future threat to us or hold them duly accountable.  No amount of policy, training, or wringing of hands can amend these crimes, and nothing has been done to protect us from the officers involved.  Ignoring this situation evidences an unexplainable disregard for justice; as such, it undermines the entire agreement.</p>
<p>Second, as you noted in your findings, persons with acute mental illness, including psychosis, mania and even depression, often do not respond as expected to authoritative commands.  Without worthwhile treatment resources, acute illness is a predictable, routinely experienced complication of many illnesses. For us, inability to respond to police immediately or typically can provoke an escalation in tactics that too often results in injury or death.  While the settlement agreement does address treatment deficiencies, it is mainly responsive to the convenience of police, not the expressed needs of our community.</p>
<p>Third, just as persons with acute mental illness may be unable to respond to police commands, many of us have an equal inability to participate in normal political or bureaucratic processes.  The settlement agreement introduces the Community Oversight Advisory Board, but its elaborate structure makes it wholly ill-considered if you want participation by persons at the center of the settlement.  It is equivalent to giving a non-Braille text of Blackwell&#8217;s Dictionary of Law to a blind student: well-meaning, thoughtless, and cruel. You should have engaged capable persons with mental illness in your planning; they are plentiful.</p>
<p>In addition to the three points included in this email, the Mental Health Association of Portland supports the <a href='http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Portland-Copwatch-DOJ-comments-10-29-2012.pdf'>initial comments about the settlement</a> made by Portland Copwatch.</p>
<p>We hope you will continue to investigate police brutality against persons with mental illness, because it does not just happen here, it is everywhere &#8212; and without real change, it will continue to deprive us of our lives, our rights, and our pursuit of happiness, unabated into the future.</p>
<p>Please note: Because our past communications with you have been ignored, we are sending copies of this email to members of the Portland City Council and to the media.</p>

				<p>By Teresa Rennick, Guest writer<br />
<a href="http://www.heraldandnews.com/members/forum/guest_commentary/article_9c8dc81e-20cc-11e2-b7ec-001a4bcf887a.html">From the Klamath Falls Herald and News, October 28, 2012</a></p>
<p><em>Teresa Rennick taught at Oregon Institute of Technology and at the Oregon Health &#038; Science University at OIT in the Nursing Department for 25 years. She worked at Klamath County Mental Health as a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner for more than 14 years. She resigned in December 2011. She is currently retired.</em></p>
<p>I’m no longer at Klamath County Mental Health. Or to quote the new director, <strong>Amanda Bunger</strong>, in the Sept. 11 <em>Herald and News</em> article, I’m one of those who “got off the bus.”</p>
<p>The reporter was told there were four of us, but in fact there have been more than 20 staff members who’ve resigned, or retired, in the last year and a half. Name changes and altered mission statements don’t change facts. Under this new administration, misinformation has been rampant, staff have been mistreated and the care of clients has been compromised. Some good investigative reporting would be welcome here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Klamath-Falls-Postcard.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Klamath-Falls-Postcard-300x194.jpg" alt="" title="Klamath-Falls-Postcard" width="300" height="194" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17215" /></a></p>
<p>“Unqualified persons writing care plans?” Ironically, these were case managers with bachelor’s degrees and many years of experience who are titled “Qualified Mental Health Associates.”</p>
<p>The state rules changed and master’s prepared staff were required to write the plans. But, check the dates and you’ll find that the changes were made and compliance was in place long before the new director climbed into the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>“Open door policy?” The first person to resign (I think of her as the canary in the coal mine) did so because of a decidedly closed door policy.</p>
<p>No indigent clients? Nobody on Medicare? Telling patients to leave when they had nowhere else to go? These abandonment policies were egregious, and many of us found them unacceptable, both legally and ethically.</p>
<p>“Nineteen mentally ill people working full-time in the community?” Is that true? What about the 13 people with severe and persistent mental illness who lost their janitorial jobs because of this new administration? Was there any financial benefit in hiring a janitorial service to clean our building when the client janitors were doing an excellent job? How do you quantify the loss of self-worth and dignity that came with termination of their employment?</p>
<p>What’s it like to work in a setting where the tone is: “You’re on the bus or off the bus?”</p>
<p>How do you make suggestions? Are you afraid to speak up for fear of reprimand? Will you be targeted, harassed and written up? How many grievances have been filed by KCMH employees in the last year and a half? The commissioners and county human resources will have this information, although concerns and complaints have largely gone unheard or were ignored by them.</p>
<p>“Better money management?” What have the hospitalization rates been under this new administration? Keeping people out of the hospital, when we can, is in the client’s best interest, plus it saves the taxpayers at least $1,200 per client, per day. In our previous administration, under Ann Lynn, our hospitalization days per month were so low that we were often a model in the state.</p>
<p>What’s the comparison between average hospitalization days per month under the old and the new system? Is the new system really saving money?</p>
<p>Under the direction of <strong>Ann Lynn</strong>, KCMH was productive and well run.</p>
<p>Our motto was “Practice Kindness,” a concept that we took seriously when dealing with clients and co-workers alike. Other supervisors who initially stayed on after Ann retired were equally respected and we were devastated when these wise and kind colleagues were targeted, treated shabbily and finally had no recourse but to resign.</p>
<p>Ask how many years of experience have been lost by the many resignations. Talk to staff who’ve left and hear their stories.</p>
<p>The new director’s metaphor about staying on the bus or getting off the bus continues to puzzle me. Where are the clients in this scene? Are they on the bus? Are they outside trying to get someone’s attention? Is the driver even looking? If the driver has only one thing in mind, “efficiency and productivity,” at apparently all costs, how many people are left waiting by the roadside, or worse, caught under the wheels?</p>
<p>The clients and the remaining staff, who continue to strive to give good care in the present atmosphere, and the citizens of Klamath County deserve better.</p>

<h2>Portland mayor, chief, and Oregon U.S. Attorney announce settlement on Portland police reforms</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/10/portland_mayor_chief_and_orego.html">By Maxine Bernstein, The Oregonian, Oct. 26, 2010</a></p>
<div id="attachment_17193" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 380px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sam-Adams-at-settlement-press-conference1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17193" title="Mayor Sam Adams" src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sam-Adams-at-settlement-press-conference1.jpg" alt="Mayor Sam Adams" width="380" height="285" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mayor Sam Adams</p></div>
<p>Portland Mayor <strong>Sam Adams</strong> and Police Chief <strong>Mike Reese</strong> stood with U.S. Attorney <strong>Amanda Marshall</strong> Friday afternoon in City Hall to announce a settlement agreement that the city reached with the U.S. Department of Justice on reforms to Portland police policy, training and oversight.</p>
<p>Among the changes called for in the agreement, Portland must hire or retain a compliance officer and appoint a community liaison to oversee reforms of police policies. A 15-member Community Oversight Advisory Board will also be created.</p>
<p>The police bureau will also adopt the kind of crisis intervention team model used in Memphis and expand its single mobile crisis unit, which pairs one officer with one Project Respond mental health worker, to three units.</p>
<p>The bureau intends to set up a new &#8220;Addictions and Behavioral Health Unit&#8221; staffed with a lieutenant, a new crisis intervention coordinator, an analyst and the five officers in the bureau&#8217;s mobile crisis unit. The manager of the existing Service Coordination Team, which works to find housing, treatment and addiction services for frequent offenders of low-level crimes, will also serve in the new unit.</p>
<p>In addition, internal affairs investigations will now have to be completed within 180 days, federal officials said. To accomplish that goal, more investigators will be hired.</p>
<p>Portland City Auditor <strong>LaVonne Griffin-Valade</strong> said she&#8217;s committed to increasing the diversity of investigators working for the Independent Police Review Division. City records show that the division will get three new full-time staff, under the agreement. Griffin-Valade said she intends to bring on at least one new investigator who has a mental health background.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement is going to make the Portland Police Bureau better,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;For me this is a watershed moment for the Portland Police Bureau.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city estimates the reforms will cost $3.5 million to implement.</p>
<p>A spreadsheet released at the conclusion of Friday&#8217;s news conference suggests that the start-up costs will be $519,301 and the annual ongoing costs will be $5.4 million.</p>
<p>The city figures show a gain of 32 new staff &#8211; 26 within the Portland Police Bureau, of which the majority are civilians, one attorney in the city attorney&#8217;s office, three full-time staff in the Independent Police Review Division and two staff members to the city&#8217;s Office of Equity.</p>
<p>A member of the Citizen Review Committee, which now hears citizen appeals of complaints against Portland police, will be added to the bureau&#8217;s Use of Force Review Board, which evaluates officer-involved shootings and use of force.</p>

<dl id="attachment_17177">
<dt>Reese also endorsed the 74-page agreement.</dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We all agree we can do better as a police bureau and as a community,&#8221; the chief said. &#8220;This agreement will provide us a road map as we move forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Joyce Harris</strong>, a member of the Albina Ministerial Alliance&#8217;s Coalition for Justice and Police Reform, urged the federal and city officials to recognize that community involvement is key to its success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I probably shouldn&#8217;t have to say this, but community engagement is critical,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t let it fall apart, because lives are at stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agreement was negotiated after federal officials announced last month that their more than year-long investigation found Portland police engage in a pattern and practice of excessive force against people who suffer from or are perceived to suffer from mental illness.</p>
<p>On Sept. 13, Assistant Attorney General <strong><strong>Thomas E. Perez</strong></strong> reported in a 42-page letter to the mayor and chief that Portland police officers frequently escalate conflict, rush in to an encounter when they can hold back and continue to use force even when the need for it has waned.</p>
<p>Federal investigators concluded that the excessive force used by officers results from bureau &#8220;deficiencies in policy, training and supervision&#8221; that have been in place for a long time.</p>
<p>Federal officials called for an array of changes in bureau policies and practices, including restrictions on the use of Tasers, a revamped use of force policy that emphasizes the need to de-escalate conflicts, and the reinstatement of a specialized team of crisis intervention officers who would be called out to respond to calls involving people in mental health crisis.</p>
<p>The agreement will go to City Council for a first review on Thursday at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Once the council formally approves the agreement, it will need to be signed by a federal judge and filed in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>The federal justice department will formally file a civil lawsuit against the city, but then voluntarily dismiss the suit from the court&#8217;s active docket. At the same time, the federal government and the city will sign the formal agreement on reforms to be adopted.</p>
<p>The agreement will be legally enforceable, as it will remain under the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Federal justice officials have said they would be available to provide technical assistance to the police bureau to help with the reforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;This agreement is going to make the Portland Police Bureau better,&#8221; Adams said at Friday&#8217;s news conference.</p>
<p>Under the 74-page settlement agreement released Friday, federal justice officials identified principles it expects the Portland police to include in its revised use of force and Taser policies.</p>
<p>It said the Portland police shall use &#8220;disengagement and de-escalation techniques,&#8221; when possible, and/or call in specialized police units when practical &#8220;in order to reduce the need for force and increase officer and civilian safety.&#8221;</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 380px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Amanda-Marshall-at-settlement-press-conf.jpg"><img title="U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall" src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Amanda-Marshall-at-settlement-press-conf.jpg" alt="U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall" width="380" height="285" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall</p></div>
<p>The agreement says Portland police will prohibit Taser use for pain compliance &#8220;against those suffering from mental illness or emotional crisis except in exigent circumstances, and then only to avoid the use of a higher level of force.&#8221;</p>
<p>It says that after the firing of one Taser cycle, officers shall evaluate the situation to determine if subsequent cycles are necessary, and that includes waiting for a reasonable amount of time to allow the person to comply with a police warning.</p>
<p>The agreement also covers supervisors&#8217; responsibilities. Portland police are to revise their directives to require that supervisory officers complete &#8220;after-action reports&#8221; within 72 hours of the officers&#8217; use of force.  Supervisors will also be subject to potential discipline or removal from their supervisory position for deficient investigations based on the &#8220;accuracy and completeness&#8221; of their after-action reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;All supervisors in the chain of command are accountable for inadequate reports and analysis,&#8221; the agreement states.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, a bureau inspector shall present a quarterly analysis of patterns or trends in Portland police use of force to the chief, the training division and the new training advisory council.</p>
<p>The inspector &#8211; a command level position in the bureau&#8217;s Professional Standards Division &#8211; will be expected to audit police use of force reports and ensure officers are acting according to bureau policy, their use of force reports are comprehensive and their supervisors are completing their responsibilities appropriately.</p>
<p>Under changes to training, the bureau is expected to instill expectations &#8220;that officers are committed to the constitutional rights of people with mental illness. The bureau must update its training plan annually, considering officer safety issues, misconduct complaints, problematic uses of force, court decisions and input from police and community members.</p>
<p>Last week, the police chief publicly released drafts of revised bureau policies for public comment, as city and federal officials were in the final throes of negotiations on the police reforms.</p>
<p>Some of the chief&#8217;s drafts did not go as far as justice officials had sought in several areas.</p>
<p>For example, federal officials urged the bureau to require officers involved in shootings to be interviewed immediately by detectives, instead of allowing a 48-hour wait after an incident. The Justice Department also urged the city to restrict the number of Taser cycles an officer can fire at a suspect.</p>
<p>The bureau did not include those standards in its drafts, but made other changes. For example, the chief wants to require officers involved in shootings to provide an &#8220;on-scene interview&#8221; to a detective, after given a reasonable chance to confer with a lawyer or union representative. It will be a briefing on what occurred, but a full sit-down interview could still be delayed for 48 hours, under union contract.</p>
<p>The chief&#8217;s draft policy on Taser use does not restrict the number of stun gun cycles an officer may fire at a single person. But it says, &#8220;members should evaluate their force options and give strong consideration to other force options, if the Taser is not effective after two&#8221; cycles on the same person.</p>
<p>Last month, federal and city officials said the proposed settlement between the Portland police and federal justice department would ensure that the city:</p>
<ul>
<li>revises its use of force policies so officers have &#8220;necessary guidance&#8221; when encountering someone with mental illness or someone perceived to have a mental illness;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>revamps its Taser policies to focus on de-escalating encounters arising from welfare checks or low-level offenses;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>expands its single Mobile Crisis Unit team, which pairs an officer with a Project Respond mental health expert, to provide 24-hour, 7-day-a-week coverage; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>sets up a Mental Health Triage Desk at the dispatch center to ensure mental health-related calls are properly dispatched to the appropriate agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the preliminary agreement, the city also agreed to work with community mental health providers to try to open a 24-hour secure drop-off, or walk-in, center that will give officers more options when helping people with mental illness. The Police Bureau would actively use its Early Intervention System to track officers with many citizen complaints or use of force complaints to help curb problem behavior; and expedite internal affairs inquiries. And, a community group would be created to continually monitor the requested reforms.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/index.cfm?c=59378&amp;a=418052">By Sam Adams, Oct. 26, 2012</a></p>
<p>Dear Portlander,</p>
<p>I hope that you are enjoying our change of seasons. City government continues to make big changes as well.</p>
<p>I am writing to let you know that we have a proposed agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that will not only improve the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) but also fast-track healthcare reforms that will increase the availability of community-based mental health care services.</p>
<p>Some solutions will require additional funds, others expedite federal and state healthcare reforms already underway, and others will require labor negotiations with our employee labor organizations.</p>
<p>The proposed Agreement is separated into several parts, which I have summarized here:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use of Force:</strong></p>
<p>PPB will retain its current force policies, which emphasize the use of less force than the maximum permitted by law. The PPB will add to its force policies de-escalation techniques and consideration about the mental health status of the person encountered (if available).</p>
<p>In addition, new policies reflecting best practices will be instituted regarding use of “Tasers.” Such policies generally will require verbal warnings, restrict the use of Tasers on people suffering from mental illness, and prohibit their use on handcuffed suspects.</p>
<p>I welcome your comments on these draft policies, currently available on PPB’s website.</p>
<p>The draft Agreement with DOJ strengthens PPB policies regarding force reports, to ensure they are timely, complete and require on-scene investigations by supervisors when a force event occurs. All supervisors in the chain of command are subject to discipline for the accuracy and completeness of force reports and investigations.</p>
<p>The use of force will also be subject to quarterly audits by an independent Inspector who will identify and correct deficiencies revealed by this trend analysis.</p>
<p><strong>2. Training:</strong></p>
<p>The Training Division will revise and update PPB&#8217;s Training plan annually to take into account any problematic uses of force and input from the community. PPB must also train all officers on the requirements of this proposed settlement Agreement. The independent Inspector also will audit the PPB’s training program using a list of performance standards that PPB must meet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Oregonian-10-27-20121.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-17208" title="Oregonian 10 27 2012" src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Oregonian-10-27-20121-674x1024.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="740" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Community-Based Mental Health Services:</strong></p>
<p>DOJ recognizes that there are other participants in the mental health infrastructure besides the City that control the quality of mental health care, including the State of Oregon, Multnomah County, Community Care Organizations (CCOs), community mental health providers, health care and emergency department providers, private insurers, and many others.</p>
<p>This proposed Agreement is only binding on the City of Portland, but DOJ expects community partners to assist the City to remedy lack of community-based addiction and mental health services to Medicaid and uninsured residents.</p>
<p>I am grateful that the CCOs and community partners have agreed to fast-track mental health service improvements to mid-2013. As such, the City, CCOs and community partners will identify opportunities for the dispatch of mental health professionals instead of police officers if and when appropriate. We will also work to ensure that PPB has better resources to gather real-time information when a person who has encountered the police is having a mental health crisis and needs assistance.</p>
<p><strong>4. Crisis Intervention:</strong></p>
<p>The PPB has agreed to develop an Addictions and Behavioral Health Unit (ABHU) within 60 days of the agreement’s effective date. It will oversee PPB’s Crisis Intervention Team, a Mobile Crisis Prevention Team and a Service Coordination Team.</p>
<p>An ABHU Advisory Committee comprised of individuals from across various government entities and mental health services providers (among others) will be established to assist the City as it provides these enhanced services.</p>
<p>PPB will continue to provide Crisis Intervention training to all its officers. In addition, the City will establish a “Memphis Model Crisis Intervention Team” and recruit volunteer officers to serve on that team. Such members will receive additional specialized training and will be dispatched if a crisis event occurs involving someone with a real or perceived mental illness.</p>
<p>PPB will expand the Mobile Crisis Prevention Team (formerly known as a Mobile Crisis Unit) to one car per PPB Precinct from one car citywide. The car shall be staffed by one sworn PPB officer and a civilian mental health professional and shall be a full time assignment.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Emergency Communication&#8217;s 9-1-1 dispatchers will complete training to triage calls related to mental health issues to the appropriate first responder resource.</p>
<p><strong>5. Employee Information System:</strong></p>
<p>The City has an employee information system to gather data and assist issues affecting employees. This will be enhanced to earlier and more effectively identify at-risk employees so that proper training can occur.</p>
<p><strong>6. Officer Accountability: </strong></p>
<p>The City will reduce the timeline for all administrative investigations of misconduct to 180 days from the receipt of a complaint. This timeline includes appeals to the Citizens Review Committee.</p>
<p>The City will also revise its protocols for “compelled statements” from officers involved in force incidents to ensure that the law is followed while still obtaining more timely information. The City must submit this protocol for DOJ approval</p>
<p>PPB’s Police Review Board, which advises the Chief on administrative reviews and recommendations for discipline, will include a member from the Citizen Review Committee in cases where use of force is being reviewed. The Citizens Review Committee will be expanded to 11 members.</p>
<p><strong>7. Community Outreach: </strong></p>
<p>There are a number of changes concerning community outreach. The Community and Police Relations Committee is part of the Portland Human Rights commission, and its function is to bring together members ofPortland’s diverse communities to improve community and police relations. The committee will be renamed the Community Oversight Advisory Board (COAB) and its functions and membership will change.  Its new functions include assessing the implementation of the Settlement Agreement, providing information to the community about the Agreement and its implementation and to contribute to the development of a PPB Community Engagement and Outreach Plan.</p>
<p>The 20 member COAB, which includes 15 voting members and 5 advisory members, will be chaired by a Compliance Officer and Community Liaison (COCL). Voting members of the Board include five Human Rights Commission members, five members chosen by City Council members and five members chosen by the community.</p>
<p><strong>8. Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>The City will hire a COCL within approximately 90 days. The duties of the COCL including preparing quarterly public reports regarding PPB’s compliance with the agreement hold quarterly town hall meetings and providing recommendations to ensure PPB is in compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, PPB will designate a Compliance Coordinator to serve as a liaison between PPB, the COCL and DOJ. The Compliance Coordinator will coordinate PPB’s compliance activities, provide data to DOJ and collection information for the COCL.</p>
<p><strong>9. Enforcement:  </strong></p>
<p>To permit federal court oversight, DOJ will file a complaint against the City and will file this settlement agreement at the same time. If disputes arise regarding PPB’s compliance with the agreement, there is a dispute mechanism that favors discussions and mediation before court action.</p>
<p>When I took over as Police Commissioner, I said I would aggressively pursue changes that would make the Portland Police Bureau the best in the nation. To that end, Commissioner Dan Saltzman, community leaders, and I invited the federal government to conduct this evaluation and make recommendations. I embrace the changes called for in this proposed agreement.</p>
<p>We have worked toward an agreement that effects positive change in the way that the Portland Police Bureau provides service to the community. Council will take public comment at a hearing on November 1, 2012 at 2 pm in City Council chambers.</p>
<p>Onward,</p>

<h2>PPB announces plan to manage use of force</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kgw.com/news/Feds-Pattern-of-excessive-police-force-in-Portland-176030661.html">From KGW.com, October 26, 2012</a></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/78IYNHYALFc" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau has announced a plan to better deal with emergency calls involving the mentally ill, which would include using only one Taser at a time.</p>
<p>The bureau made the changes after a U.S. Department of Justice investigation concluded it had engaged in &#8220;a pattern or practice of excessive use of force,&#8221; specifically when dealing with the mentally ill.</p>
<p>The new plan, put forth at a press conference Friday afternoon, will focus on de-escalation tactics, Portland Mayor <strong>Sam Adams</strong> said. Only one Taser will be used at a time and officers will attempt to use handcuffs between Taser deployments.</p>
<p>“For me this is a watershed moment for the City of Portland, for the Portland Police bureau, also the fire bureau and 911, and our first responders,” Adams said. “We are fully embracing the responsibility. We have and realities we face when it comes to dealing with folks who are perceived or suffering from mental illness.”</p>
<p>The DOJ report last month found that law enforcement agencies are often the first responders in mental health crises, so the new agreement will increase the mental health resources involved in such calls.</p>
<p>There will be three mobile crisis units on the streets, rather than just one. Each unit will include a specially-trained officer and mental health expert.</p>
<p>“As police officers we embrace our role in these changes, and the challenges we face in difficult circumstances every day,” said Portland Police Chief <strong>Mike Reese</strong>. “We all agree we can do better as a police bureau and community. This agreement will provide us a roadmap as we move forward.”</p>
<p>The cost of the agreement was estimated at $3.3 million. Adams did not say how it would be funded.</p>

<h2 id="title_Trans">Portland Police, U.S. Department of Justice, Release Agreement on Mental Health Reforms</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-29371-portland_police_us_d.html">By Andrea Damewood, Willamette Week, Oct. 26, 2012</a></p>
<div id="attachment_17197" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 401px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Reese-and-Adams-at-settlement-press-conf.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-17197" title="Reese and Adams at settlement press conf" src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Reese-and-Adams-at-settlement-press-conf.jpg" alt="Portland mayor Sam Adams (L) and Chief Mike Reese (R)" width="401" height="246" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Portland mayor Sam Adams (L) and Chief Mike Reese (R)</p></div>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the city of Portland released a settlement agreement Friday on changes the city must make in order to stay out of court, in the wake of the DOJ’s findings that police have a pattern of using excessive force against the mentally ill.</p>
<p>The agreement ramps up both internal and external supervision of the department, expands police crisis training and response and further restricts officers’ use of Tasers.</p>
<p>Unlike many cities slapped with a DOJ case, Portland will not have an independent DOJ monitor of its reforms. Rather, the city must hire or retain a compliance officer and liaison to track progress. The liaison—to be selected from three candidates by the city council—will provide quarterly public reports, U.S. Attorney <strong>Amanda Marshall</strong> said during a press conference Friday at City Hall.</p>
<p>Officers must also only use one Taser at a time, and must attempt to handcuff suspects after each 5-second discharge of the weapon, she says. That portion of the recommendation doesn’t exactly jibe with a draft policy revision released by Chief <strong>Mike Reese</strong> last week, which did not restrict the number of Taser cycles that could be used on a person.</p>
<p>Oregon ACLU president <strong>Dave Fidanque</strong> said that his agency will meet with the police to express some of their concerns, including those about the draft Taser policy.</p>
<p>“There’s other stuff that needs to happen,” he says, adding that the bureau should ban stun gun use on those practicing active resistance—which includes actions like “tensing”?—and restrict use to those aggressively resisting officers.</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau will also create a Crisis Intervention Team of specially trained officers who will respond to all calls suspected to involve mental illness. The agreement will also expand the police Mobile Crisis Unit—a vehicle pairing one officer and a private social worker—to a 24 hour program.</p>
<p>A 15-member Community Oversight Advisory Board will also be created. The city auditor’s office will also hire three new investigators, including at least one with a background in mental health, City Auditor <strong>LaVonneGriffin-Valade</strong> says.</p>
<p>The cost is expected to be $5.8 million in the first year, and includes 26 new staff members in the PPB and six new staff members elsewhere in the city.</p>
<p>“I haven’t figured out how to pay for it, but we will,” Mayor <strong>Sam Adams</strong> said.</p>
<p>Adams, Chief <strong>Mike Reese</strong> and Commissioner <strong>Amanda Fritz</strong> all also spoke at the press conference Friday, and heralded the agreement’s stipulations.</p>
<p>“We’re fully embracing the responsibility that we have and the reality we face in dealing with those with mental illness,” Adams says. “We embrace the totality of our role in the mental health system.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice released its report on the department’s “pattern and practice” of unconstitutional use of excessive force against those with mental illness. Friday’s agreement was due on Oct. 12, but the city needed extra time to complete the 74-page document.</p>
<p>Other mental health services are expected to be bolstered as a result of the DOJ&#8217;s report—those are due in mid-May, according to the city.</p>

<h2>Portland, U.S. agree on police reforms; use of force against the mentally ill leads to change</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.registerguard.com/web/news/cityregion/28953026-46/police-officer-portland-agreement-mental.html.csp">By Steven DuBois, Associated Press, from the Register-Guard, Oct. 27, 2010</a></p>

<p>The city of Portland has reached a proposed settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on police reforms in the wake of an investigation that found that officers too frequently use excessive force against the mentally ill.</p>
<p>The deal announced Friday afternoon by Mayor <strong>Sam Adams</strong>, Police Chief <strong>Mike Reese</strong> and U.S. Attorney <strong>Amanda Marshall</strong> includes more oversight of the police bureau as well as additional training and revisions to its policy on the use of stun guns.</p>
<p>“When I took over as police commissioner, I said I would aggressively pursue changes. These are the changes that will make Portland a better place,” Adams said via Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>The City Council will hear public comment on the settlement at its meeting Thursday. Once the council approves it, the agreement must be signed by a federal judge and filed in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>The Justice Department opened its investigation last year to examine whether Portland police engaged in a “pattern or practice” of excessive force when dealing with the mentally ill. Agency officials concluded in September that such a pattern exists, and began negotiating with city leaders on reforms.</p>
<p>The city has agreed to hire a compliance officer to ensure that the agreement is followed and form a Community Oversight Advisory Board. The board, which will be chaired by the compliance officer, will include 15 voting members and five advisory panelists.</p>
<p>The Justice Department investigation listed several examples in which officers used stun guns without justification against people in a mental health crisis.</p>
<p>The police bureau’s updated policy limits the use of stun guns on people suffering from mental illness and prohibits their use on handcuffed suspects.</p>
<p>It encourages officers to attempt to handcuff suspects rather than subject them to repeated “cycles” from Tasers, referred to as electronic control weapons in the settlement agreement.</p>
<p>“After one standard ECW cycle (5 seconds) the officer shall re-evaluate the situation to determine if subsequent cycles are necessary,” the agreement states, “including waiting for a reasonable amount of time to allow the subject to comply with the warning.”</p>
<p>In other reforms, the city must:</p>
<p>Create a crisis intervention team, composed of patrol officers with specialized training, to be dispatched when a mental health issue is the main reason for the call.</p>
<p>Expand its mobile crisis units from one car citywide to one car per precinct. The cars will be staffed with an officer and a civilian mental health worker.</p>
<p>Ensure that investigations of officer misconduct are completed within 180 days.</p>

<p>For 13 years, the city of Portland has awarded a Lake Oswego man a contract to conduct psychological exams of prospective Portland police hires and to gauge whether officers who have been involved in shootings and other major events are fit to return to duty.</p>
<p>With little or no discussion, the City Council has granted or extended psychologist <strong>David M. Corey</strong>&#8216;s contract nine times and paid him close to half a million dollars.</p>
<p>The city sought competitive bids for the contract three times: in 1999, when Corey was first picked to develop and conduct psychological tests; in 2003 when the contract was extended; and this year, after a decade of contract extensions with no bids sought.</p>
<p>When the city did open the contract to competitive bidding this year, it was riddled with controversy.</p>
<p>While Corey is highly regarded nationally and there&#8217;s been no specific problems cited with Corey&#8217;s work, members of the city&#8217;s minority communities say they object to his &#8220;monopoly&#8221; on the police bureau contract. They argue Corey has failed to weed out some officers with a propensity for violence, pointing to last month&#8217;s U.S. Department of Justice finding that Portland police use excessive force against people with mental illness.</p>
<p>Mayor <strong>Sam Adams</strong>, the police commissioner, recently backed away from awarding a new five-year contract to Corey. He acknowledged the city could have done more to draw a broader pool of bidders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the criticism was fair,&#8221; the mayor said, adding, &#8220;The fact that the contract has been with one person for so long is worth reviewing.</p>
<p>Critics have urged the city to find psychologists from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city is only getting this one white guy from Lake Oswego&#8217;s point of view,&#8221; said <strong>Dan Handelman</strong> of Portland Copwatch.</p>
<p>Corey, president of the American Board of Police &amp; Public Safety Psychology, said the concerns are not off base. The community&#8217;s call for a multi-cultural group of psychologists to help determine police candidates&#8217; suitability for the job &#8220;warrants serious consideration&#8221; by the city, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How the Portland Police Bureau selects its police officers should reflect the needs and interests of the broader community,&#8221; Corey wrote in an e-mail to The Oregonian.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to reviewing the city&#8217;s new specifications for the services and to preparing a responsive proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corey added, &#8220;My firm has had no role in determining the frequency of these competitive bids over the past 13 years.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">?◊?</p>
<p>In 1999, the bureau for the first time sought a psychologist to develop and conduct evaluations for police candidates and fitness-for-duty evaluations of sworn officers when there&#8217;s a concern about their ability to perform their job. Three psychologists submitted bids, and Corey&#8217;s was lowest. His rate then: $325 per applicant; $150 per hour for fitness-for-duty tests.</p>
<p>A police captain, a lieutenant, an acting sergeant, and a police human resources analyst were on the selection committee. The city wanted a vendor to assess police candidates&#8217; emotional control, sensitivity, moral-ethical behavior, and &#8220;ability to appropriately employ force under extreme stress.&#8221;</p>
<p>In subsequent years, the City Council voted eight times to extend Corey&#8217;s contract. Often, police bureau officials told council members that an emergency existed, allowing the city to bypass competitive bidding. The emergency, the bureau said, was that officer recruitment and fitness-for-duty evaluations needed to continue &#8220;without disruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>In July 2009, the city also awarded Corey a $150,000 five-year contract to conduct psychological exams on prospective emergency dispatchers, without seeking competitive bids. The Bureau of Emergency Communications cited an exemption from city procurement rules that allows no-bid contracting when determining &#8220;any prospective or current City employee&#8217;s ability to work or return to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most recently, on Feb. 2, Police Chief Mike Reese tried to extend Corey&#8217;s contract with the police bureau through March. Reese told the council no public involvement was sought &#8220;because it pertains to internal city government services provided by Dr. Corey,&#8221; as approved by a 2004 contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sean Murray</strong>, the police bureau&#8217;s personnel manager, defended Corey&#8217;s work. &#8220;The bureau has been pleased with Dr. Corey&#8217;s service,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;Dr. Corey&#8217;s process has not had any adverse impact on protected-status groups.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">?◊?</p>
<p>According to Corey, his psychological exams disqualify 32.2 percent of Portland police candidates. Candidates of color are not at a disadvantage, Corey told a community group in 2010. His data showed some disparities for Native American candidates, but Corey said last week the current pass rate for the Native American applicants shows no &#8220;significant disparity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the pre-employment psychological evaluation for police applicants consists of a lengthy series of questions. The pre-offer phase consists of 614 questions. A post-offer evaluation consists of 992 questions. There is also a face-to-face interview as a part of the psychological evaluation.</p>
<p>Community activists became concerned about police psychological exams after a Portland police officer&#8217;s controversial 2010 shooting of an unarmed black man. Leaders of the Albina Ministerial Alliance and Portland Copwatch urged the mayor and chief to reach out to diverse communities to broaden the pool of psychologists available.</p>
<p>When the city this year asked for bids, it received only two: from Corey, and another psychologist.</p>
<p>This time, Corey was chosen by a selection committee that consisted of: the mayor&#8217;s public safety aide; the police bureau&#8217;s internal affairs captain; a retired African-American police lieutenant who works security in City Hall; and two citizen members of the minority community, one from the Albina Ministerial Alliance.</p>
<p>Each was given a draft of the city&#8217;s bid request and asked to offer any suggested changes. One community member questioned whether it was a conflict of interest for the same psychologist to perform initial screenings of applicants and fitness-for-duty exams of current officers.</p>
<p>Corey, in an interview, said finding a person psychologically fit at one time doesn&#8217;t preclude finding the person unfit later.</p>
<p>By Feb. 26,, the council was poised to extend Corey&#8217;s contract for five years. The ordinance was on the council&#8217;s consent agenda, meaning there would be no council discussion or public comment.</p>
<p>But community activists raised strong objections.</p>
<div align="center">?◊?</div>
<p>Pastor <strong>T. Allen Bethel</strong>, chair of the Albina Ministerial Alliance, was disturbed there were only two bidders. He said alliance members would have alerted prospective psychologists if they had known bidding had started.</p>
<p>&#8220;We notice that Dr. Corey has had this contract for over 10 years,&#8221; Bethel told the council.</p>
<p>The mayor backed off and proposed extending the contract for six months through the end of August, which the council approved.</p>
<p>In September, another emergency ordinance went before the council. The bureau asked to extend Corey&#8217;s contract through Oct. 31, adding $20,000 to cover additional police psychological testing. Murray told commissioners that there were &#8220;outstanding invoices to be paid&#8221; because the bureau had hired more officers. If the money wasn&#8217;t approved, the bureau couldn&#8217;t hire the recruits, Murray said.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa Roberts</strong>, a citizen, addressed the council. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand the fast-tracking of crucial considerations like this,&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;In this economy, with so many people looking for jobs, to have only two qualified applicants &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t make sense. It does not engender trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before awarding a long-term contract, Adams promised that the city would develop a new request for bids and appoint a new committee for selecting a police psychologist, with greater outreach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m using this mistake to consult with the feds on best practices,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;I want to figure out what the best way forward is.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Sharyn Smith</strong> calls herself an extreme parent.</p>
<div id="attachment_17162" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 200px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pendleton-Beauty.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Pendleton-Beauty-200x300.jpg" alt="Pendleton Beauty" title="Pendleton Beauty" width="200" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-17162" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pendleton Beauty</p></div>
<p>She quit her in-home childcare job in 2008 to raise her own son, Adam, then 4, whose behavior was so erratic she couldn&#8217;t even take him to the library. She and her husband <strong>Dan Smith</strong> had tried for a year and a half to understand his outbursts before taking Adam to psychiatrist <strong>David Conant-Norville</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could tell when he&#8217;d get this way, he gets a different look in his eye,&#8221;? Sharyn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost a feral type look.&#8221;?</p>
<p>Conant-Norville diagnosed Adam with bipolar, obsessive compulsive and attention deficit disorders, prescribed him medication and gave Sharyn and Dan tips for managing his conditions.</p>
<p>The family still has to cancel plans because of Adam&#8217;s moods, but they don&#8217;t face these trials alone. Since November, they&#8217;ve worked through their challenges with other parents of children with emotional, developmental and behavioral disorders with Special Needs Families Connect.</p>
<p>The support group&#8217;s 20 members offer each other peer counseling, advice and references to resources from insurance to therapists.</p>
<p>Smith said she speaks with someone from the group daily. Group members have monthly meetings, organize play dates for their children and babysit for each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re kind of an extended family in a way,&#8221;?she said. &#8220;It definitely does decrease the amount of trips to the psychiatrist.&#8221;?</p>
<p>Conant-Norville said such support groups are one way for Pendleton to leverage its limited mental health resources. The city has three clinical psychologists, and Conant-Norville is its only psychiatrist.</p>
<p>But he said the community can remedy the dearth by capitalizing on the kind of tight-knit connections only small towns have, which can make it easier for people to make referrals to mental health services.</p>
<p>Special Needs Families Connect does this well because it&#8217;s overseen by a professional organization. Autism Society of Oregon gives classes on handling special needs children&#8217;s behavior, and trained <strong>Sharon and Winnie Brunett</strong> to lead the support group&#8217;s discussions.</p>
<p>Even with these resources, Pendleton is still strained by its lack of mental health professionals. Clinical psychologist <strong>Connie Umphred</strong> often puts patients on wait lists; the Smiths had to wait a month for their first appointment with Conant-Norville.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are full all the time,&#8221; Umphred said. &#8220;We do take new patients, but we&#8217;re very busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conant-Norville said rural areas commonly lack these resources. The shortage of psychologist and psychiatrists spans eastern Oregon; <strong>Terrel Templeman</strong>, Ph.D. and Umphred see clients from as far as La Grande and John Day at Psychological Services of Pendleton.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say how many of these professionals the community needs.</p>
<p>Conant-Norville was booked when the city had three other psychiatrists when he worked here full-time from 1987 to 1993. Even if the city had more psychiatrists, many people with mental disorders would go untreated because they don&#8217;t have health insurance, he said.</p>
<p>Templeman said two more psychologists would fill his and <strong>Stephen Condon</strong>, Ph.D.&#8217;s practices. Templeman will hire <strong>Heather Bacon</strong>, Ph.D. when she finishes her year-long residency at his practice and receives a clinical psychology license.</p>
<p>Umphred sends some clients to social workers or marriage and family counselors for therapy if they don&#8217;t absolutely need to see a clinical psychologist. This leaves her with the difficulty of deciding which patients need her professional attention.</p>
<p>Some patients&#8217; needs require the expertise of a clinical psychologist, including personality disorders, gender identity issues, and underlying problems people develop from experiences such as being physically, sexually or emotionally abused as a child.</p>
<p>The training, continued education, and licensing clinical psychologists are required to have equip them to perform the diagnosis and assessment these issues demand. Umphred refers patients with less complex issues, such as an adolescent having a hard time adjusting to a new stepparent, to a social workers or marriage and family counselors.</p>
<p>Conant-Norville, who flies in from Portland twice a week and offers video appointments for patients at Mind Matters, P.C. Child &#038; Family Psychiatry, relies on physicians to shoulder Pendleton&#8217;s psychiatric case load.</p>
<p><strong>Karen Dunlap</strong>, physician assistant at Pendleton Family Medicine, said primary care doctors and physician assistants can make diagnoses and write prescriptions for psychiatric issues including depression, anxiety, bipolar and attention deficit disorders, and bereavement.</p>
<p>Dunlap said she refers patients to psychiatrists if she&#8217;s exhausted her treatment resources, but rarely does so because of the city&#8217;s lacking mental health resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people will not get treatment, or they&#8217;ll choose not to get it instead of driving somewhere,&#8221; Umphred said. &#8220;Those people that do choose to find some type of treatment will further stress the limited resources we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Umphred said psychologists and psychiatrists may not come to Pendleton because they want to work in a bigger city, where they may make more money and have a greater client base. Conant-Norville said he&#8217;s tried to recruit another psychiatrist to Pendleton since he started working here in 1987 to no avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t realize that this place has a lot to offer,&#8221; Umphred said. &#8220;Pendleton doesn&#8217;t market itself very well and I think we need to find a way to do that.&#8221;</p>

				<p>By <strong>Joseph D. Bloom</strong>, MD &#8211; Dean Emeritus at the School of Medicine and a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University.<br />
From - <a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-incarceration-revolution-Joseph-D.-Bloom.pdf">Conundrums and Controversies in Mental Health and Illness</a> • Winter 2010</p>
<p>In 1848 <strong>Dorothea Dix</strong>, the famous 19th century advocate for the indigent mentally ill, appealed to the United States Congress to support the set- aside of a very large tract of land that was to be used for the “Relief and Support of the Indigent Curable and Incurable Insane.” She stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It will be said by a few, perhaps that each State should establish and sustain its own institutions; that it is not obligatory upon the general government to legislate for maintenance of State charities&#8230;. But may it not be demonstrated as the soundest policy of the federal government to assist in the accomplishment of great moral obligations, by diminishing and arresting wide-spread miseries which mar the face of society; and weaken the strength of communities?</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, the “12,225,000 Acre Act,” did pass the Congress, but was vetoed by President <strong>Franklin Pierce</strong>, who stated in his 1854 veto statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have been compelled&#8230;to overcome the reluctance with which I dissent from the conclusions of the two Houses of Congress&#8230;. If Congress has power to make provision for the indigent insane&#8230;the whole field of public beneficence is thrown open to the care and culture of the Federal Government.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I readily&#8230;acknowledge the duty incumbent on us all&#8230;to provide for those who, in the mysterious order of Providence, are subject to want and to disease of body or mind but I cannot find any authority in the Constitution that makes the Federal Government the great almoner of public charity throughout the United States. To do so would, in my judgement, be contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution&#8230;and be prejudicial rather than beneficial to the noble office of charity.2</p>
<p>For most of our country’s history, the federal government followed the position taken by President Pierce and avoided major responsibility for the public mental health system or for that matter, now, for a national health system. In fact, the only time the federal government assumed a significant role in the care of the mentally ill was between the end of World War II and the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. This era began with great optimism and ended with all the seeds of the current crisis in mental health care clearly apparent as the forces that were unleashed began to unfold.</p>
<div id="attachment_17172" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/emergosh0023.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17172" title="Shown above is the exercise yard at the Oregon State Insane Asylum in about 1905.

<p>Prior to and after the election of President Reagan, the states had the major responsibility for the care of the seriously and chronically mentally ill. The earlier state era was characterized by the large state mental hospital, while the current state era is characterized by the criminalization of the mentally ill. In order to describe the current condition, I will use the public mental health system in the State of Oregon as a case study. Oregon is chosen because of my 30-year experience with the public mental health system in this particular state. I believe and hope to illustrate that Oregon’s problems in the delivery of public mental health services are very similar to those that exist in most states.</p>
<p><strong>The Federal Era in Mental Health Services</strong></p>
<p>The linchpin of the federal era was <strong>John F. Kennedy</strong>’s 1963 Presidential Message on Mental Illness and Mental Retardation. President Kennedy described the failures of the past and looked forward to a new direction for the country. He stated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Most importantly the institutions that housed such large numbers of mentally ill individuals were slated to be closed. Hospitalization, if needed, was to take place either in the community mental health center’s inpatient service or in the developing psychiatric inpatient services in local community general hospitals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in retrospect, and for a variety of reasons, the community mental health center movement was a conceptual success, but an actual failure. Not enough centers were funded. For those that were, the funding formula in the federal legislation was based on a decreasing federal match with state funds, and many states did not pick up the costs. In addition, the centers themselves were accused of not focusing sufficient resources toward the problems of the chronically mentally ill.</p>
<p>President <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> attempted to refocus the federal program on the problems of the chronically mentally ill. He came to the presidency with a strong commitment to mental health services which he and President Kennedy’s concern was translated into a bill that was introduced into Congress one month before his death,4 enacted soon after, and signed by President Johnson. The passage of this legislation created the community mental health center movement.</p>
<p>I began my psychiatric residency in that same year, 1963, and experienced the community mental health center movement on a personal level. The movement was conceptually elegant. Each state was governed by a mandatory state mental health plan that divided the state into designated catchment areas. Each area was assigned a priority score for the development of a community mental health center responsible for the mental health care for the catchment area population. It was anticipated that catchment areas might differ as to the characteristics of their distinct populations. Using the developing methods of psychiatric epidemiology, the goal was to measure the amount and types of mental illness in the particular population and then tailor services to the particular needs of that population.</p>
<p>Each mental health center was to have inpatient, outpatient and partial hospitalization services, a 24-hour walk-in service for immediate care, along with a branch of consultation and education designed to strengthen the mental health fabric of the community.  Local administrative control and accountability were part of the CMHC governance and, of course, there was the promise of adequate funding.</p>
<p>Most importantly the institutions that housed such large numbers of mentally ill individuals were slated to be closed. Hospitalization, if needed, was to take place either in the community mental health center’s inpatient service or in the developing psychiatric inpatient services in local community general hospitals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in retrospect, and for a variety of reasons, the community mental health center movement was a conceptual success, but an actual failure. Not enough centers were funded. For those that were, the funding formula in the federal legislation was based on a decreasing federal match with state funds, and many states did not pick up the costs. In addition, the centers themselves were accused of not focusing sufficient resources toward the problems of the chronically mentally ill.</p>
<p>President Jimmy Carter attempted to refocus the federal program on the problems of the chronically mentally ill. He came to the presidency with a strong commitment to mental health services which he and his wife helped to strengthen in the State of Georgia.</p>
<p>As president, in 1979, he delivered a message on mental health which:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8230;.establishes a new partnership between the federal government and the states in the planning and provision of mental health services. It seeks to assure that the chronically mentally ill no longer face the cruel alternative of unnecessary institutionalization or inadequate care in the community.5</p>
<p>In his message President Carter noted that although 700 community mental health centers had been built, serving some 3 million patients annually, the majority of the country’s population were not served by federally funded community mental health centers. During the same time period what actually did occur was the accelerated discharge of the state hospital patients into local communities. This came about for many reasons including the advances made in psychiatric drug treatment, and the great pressure coming from the legal and patient rights community driven in part by reforms in civil commitment laws.6 The results, as is evident, from President Carter’s words, were large numbers of chronically mentally ill individuals in the community, many who were faced with inadequate community level care.</p>
<p>To put President Carter’s words in perspective, in 1955 there were 558,239 state and county psychiatric beds in the United States.7 When he took office in 1976 there were 222,202 beds in the country, and when he left office in 1980 there were 156,713 beds.8 (For reference later in this paper, in 2005 there were 52,539 beds in what was left of state and county hospitals for the mentally ill.9) This was the time that the terms “deinstitutionalization,”10 “the homeless mentally ill,”11 and “the chronic mental patient in the community” first appeared in the mental health literature,12 and we first began to be concerned with the mentally ill as they became a significant population within the nation’s jails and prisons.13</p>
<p>The federal era ended with the election of President Reagan. He ended support for federally funded community mental health centers and instead funded block grants to the states to be used within general guidelines to support state services. However, it is important to note that since that time federal support of mental health programs has remained in the form of financial support to individuals and states through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In essence federal leadership and national policy were replaced by financial support for individuals.</p>
<p><strong>The New State Era in Mental Health Services: Oregon — A Case Example</strong></p>
<p>Is the public mental health system in Oregon representative of the services provided in other states?</p>
<p>There are several studies that compare states on various indices related to mental health care. In 2006 the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) compared state mental health systems using a detailed quality index that rated programs along ten defined criteria14 ranging from comprehensive services and support, to access to acute and long-term care treat- ment, to adequate funding. These criteria were adopted to support recovery oriented treatment models which most public mental health programs support today.15</p>
<p>Five states received a grade of B with the highest scoring states being Connecticut and Ohio. Seventeen states received a C, 19 a D, and 8 were awarded an F. Oregon received a C+, while South Carolina received a B-. NAMI identified that the most urgent need in both of these states was “funding.” South Carolina was ranked 32nd in per capita funding for mental health while Oregon ranked 40th. NAMI gave the country as a whole a national grade of D.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Treatment Advocacy Center issued an online report that evaluated the adequacy of the number of state and county hospital beds in each state using a scale developed by an expert panel organized by the survey’s authors.16 In 2005, there were 17 public hospital beds per 100,000 in the U.S. population. The expert panel determined that 50 beds per 100,000 was the minimum number needed to provide adequate service. Eleven states, including South Carolina (10.6 beds per 100,000) were determined to have a “critical bed shortage” in public beds, while Oregon was listed with 20 other states as one category better in the “severe bed shortage” range, with 19.2 beds per 100,000. Only one state, Mississippi, at 49.7 beds per 100,000 was at the minimum number determined by the expert panel. From these two surveys at least, Oregon does not appear to be an outlier.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon’s Programs<br />
</strong><br />
As in most states Oregon traditionally funded its state hospitals with general fund dollars while community funding is based on a “state-county partnership” written into law in 1973. Community programs are administered at the local level by county health and/or mental health departments.</p>
<p>This partnership was altered in the decade between 1993-2003 when the Oregon Health Plan was most prominent. Since 2003 the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) has been in decline,17 but some of the mechanisms that were set in place for the OHP, which included the establishment of specific insurance products and some mental health carve outs, remain in place.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon’s State Hospitals</strong></p>
<p>My colleagues and I recently examined the inpatient bed situation in Oregon in both state and private hospitals18 and found that for the most part Oregon’s psychiatric hospitals are full to capacity. In addition, the state is, in essence, running a forensic inpatient system for those who enter the hospital under the state’s civil commitment or criminal justice standards, those who are incompetent to stand trial, and those who enter under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board.19 We found in another study20 that over the past 20 years civil emergency holds have increased as the population of the state has increased, while actual civil commitments have diminished by 50 percent. The state hospitals now predominantly serve the civil commitment court (24% of the state hospital population) and the criminal courts (63% of the state hospital population). The state hospitals contribute minimally to the general welfare of the non-court adjudicated Oregonian. In the same study (cited above) we found that over the last decade the number of general hospital psychiatric beds had significantly decreased in Oregon, and this decrease mirrors the national situation. It is extremely important to note that there is, in essence, no room for the voluntary patient in either state or the community hospital beds.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues related to those who are served at the state hospitals, Oregon’s major state hospital, the Oregon State Hospital (OSH), is operating under very heavy strain. Oregon is one of the oldest western states and OSH is one of the oldest state hospitals in the west. It was originally built in 1883 and most of its “newer” buildings are close to 50 years old. To understand the current pressures affecting OSH, it is helpful to understand three recent lawsuits and one threatened lawsuit.</p>
<p>The first suit,21 heard in the Federal District Court for the District of Oregon22 and decided in favor of the plaintiffs in 2002, sought to compel the State of Oregon to provide more expeditious treatment for criminal defendants who had been found incompetent to stand trial and who were languishing in Oregon jails waiting for beds at the Oregon State Hospital. The plaintiffs, presented data that showed that seriously mentally ill individuals were held in jails under very poor circumstances, for abnormally long periods of time, awaiting evaluation or treatment beds at the state hospital. Data was presented on 105 individuals who had been found incompetent to stand trial of criminal charges. These individuals spent an average of 32 days in jail waiting for a bed. Forty-eight were held for more than 30 days and nine were held for more than 60 days. Only 19 were transported to the hospital in fewer than seven days. The judge’s final order stated that admissions to the state hospital “must be done in a timely manner, and completed not later than seven days after the issuance of an order determining a criminal defendant to be unfit to proceed to trial because of mental incapacities.”</p>
<p>The second law suit, settled in 2003, was a class action suit23 brought against Oregon’s two state hospitals, contending that the defendants failed “to develop the array of community-based mental health services needed to meet the special needs of a group of patients, causing them to remain unnecessarily institutionalized in Oregon state hospitals.” This case was Oregon’s response to the 1999 United States Supreme Court decision in<em> Olmstead v. L.C.24</em> in which the Court held that states were required to provide community based treatment when treatment professionals had determined that these placements were justified. The Oregon case was concluded with a settlement agreement which applied to “civilly committed adults in Oregon state hospitals” and “who had not been discharged within 90 days of the ready-to-place determination of their Treatment Team.” The state agreed to develop additional community based facilities and resources to accommodate members of the class.</p>
<p>The third law suit, Harmon v. Fickle,25 finalized in 2006, alleged that the State failed to provide adequate numbers of professional and direct care staff at the state hospital; failed to provide adequate and “meaningful” treatment; had violated multiple plaintiffs’ rights to privacy; and failed to protect patients from harm. The settlement agreement stated that the state would take “all necessary steps within their control” to increase the staff patient ratio by both hiring more staff and by reducing the state hospital population by developing secure residential treatment options in the community. The state legislature made funds available to achieve these goals, but to date neither goal has been reached. The hospital has been unable to hire sufficient staff, mainly nursing and psychiatric staff, and attempts to contract for more community secure residential placements especially for those hospitalized from the criminal courts have met severe resistance in several of Oregon’s communities.</p>
<p>These problems at the Oregon State Hospital led to a 2006 Department of Justice investigation under the authority of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).26 In January of 2008 the Justice Department issued its findings, a stinging critique of the hospital.27 The CRIPA investigators found that the hospital failed to protect patients from patient to patient assault, and from the physical dangers inherent in the aged facilities themselves. There was a heavy emphasis in the report on the problem of inadequate nursing care. In addition the report faulted aspects of psychiatric and psychological practices including lack of adequate assessments, medication management, and overuse of seclusion and restraint, with additional weakness found in discharge planning.</p>
<p>The 2007 Oregon Legislature responded to the CRIPA investigation with a significant financial commitment to build two new state hospitals with a total of 1100 beds. The numbers of professional staff needed for these hospitals was not actively debated,and the need is only now beginning to become apparent to state leaders within the executive and legislative branches. The question of how to find the requisite numbers of nurses and physicians is yet to be addressed along with the sticker shock that will no doubt accompany this discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon’s Community Mental Health Programs</strong></p>
<p>The situation is not much better with regard to Oregon’s community mental health programs. These programs serve predominantly three categories of clients: those who remain as OHP beneficiaries, those who receive traditional Medicare and Medicaid benefits, and those with no coverage of any sort (the medically indigent). There is limited funding with limited treatment options available for the medically indigent.</p>
<p>Cascadia Behavioral Health, a not-for-profit private agency, operated on contracts with state and local governments and on fee-for-service revenue. The program provided mental health services to 20,000 clients in five of Oregon’s largest counties, particularly in Portland, the state’s largest city, and at its height had a budget of some $60 million per year.</p>
<p>The Cascadia story provides an instructive lesson in regard to the problems inherent in community mental health programs in this state. What it says is that these programs operate very close to the margin. In essence, they are grossly under-funded by both state and county governments. If they are not extremely well managed, they will run into trouble, as was the case with Cascadia Behavioral Health. State and county officials responsible for oversight were not sufficiently aware of the problems because too little attention was paid to program evaluation and oversight.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Consequences</strong></p>
<p>President Carter stated in 1979 that “unnecessary institutionalization” has given way to “inadequate community care.” He was correct, and in retrospect the dynamics were clear, resulting from the rapid reduction in the number of inpatients; closure of beds; increased vigilance, legal and otherwise, at the front door blocking easy access to the remaining beds; decreasing federal responsibility for the community mental health center movement; and the inability or unwillingness of states to assume the necessary financial burden to adequately fund hospital and community programs. All of these factors have produced the current situation with the most negative result being the large-scale criminalization of the mentally ill.</p>
<p>“Unnecessary institutionalization” has been replaced in many places by unavailable institutionalization. This situation is highlighted by the Oregon data, and nationally by the Treatment Advocacy Center,28 the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors,29 the American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians,30 President George W. Bush’s New Freedom Commission,31 and a recent commentary in the American Journal of Psychiatry.32</p>
<p>This situation in Oregon and across the U.S. leads to an inevitable pathway to the nation’s jails and the prisons.33 In a recent commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association, H. Richard Lamb and Linda Weinberger,34 citing evidence from the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, reported that in 2006 there were “at least” 341,000 incarcerated persons with severe mental illness in the United States, representing approximately 15% of incarcerated individuals in that year.</p>
<p>Bernard Harcourt contributed an added dimension to the discussion of mental hospital institutionalization in the United States by analyzing aggregate data from mental hospitals and jails and prisons in the years 1928-2000.35 He noted that hospitalization rates peaked in 1955 and declined rapidly after that date reaching the low levels cited in this paper (deinstitutionalization) and also noted that since the early 1980s the country is in an expanding period of criminal incarceration (the “incarceration revolution”). By combining data from both mental hospitals and the jails and prisons, Harcourt found that the current combined level of institutionalization had not yet reached the aggregate levels that existed in 1955. He also noted an inverse relationship between decreasing total institutionalization and the national homicide rate. Harcourt argues for further investigation to look for precise explanation for this finding.36</p>
<p>From the criminal justice system perspective, the current era is characterized as an “incarceration revolution,” while from the mental health perspective the era of deinstitutionalization has given way to the era of the criminalization of the mentally ill. The public mental hospitals now have the lowest number of beds in decades, and over the last decade we have been losing community hospitals beds, even as our population continues to increase.37</p>
<p><strong>Are There Any Solutions?</strong></p>
<p>Here it is appropriate to briefly discuss the question of national policy and the political process. First and foremost, there needs to be a national mental health plan, a consensus plan that is actively supported by the federal government.</p>
<p>We haven’t had clear national mental health policy since the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter. There was some hope of positive movement early in the presidency of<strong> George W. Bush</strong> when in 2002 he appointed the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health charged with studying the mental health service system and making recommendations for improvements in the system.38 The president set out five Principles to guide the Commission, one of which, however, stated that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Commission shall follow the principles of Federalism, and ensure that its recommendations promote innovation, flexibility, and accountability at all levels of government and respect the constitutional role of the States and Indian tribes.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of President Pierce, this statement meant that President Bush was not interested in the development of national policy that would govern approaches in each state. That said, the Commission did make a serious effort to comprehensively describe the state of the country’s mental health service system, including its current deficits, and developed six goals for improving the system. The Commission also recognized the work of promising programs from various parts of the county. But, in keeping with the spirit of the new federalism, little comprehensive federal policy changes were recommended and little attempt was made that would bind the country to another major and unified approach that would address the current problems and look to a better future.</p>
<p>In addition, at the political level, recent decades of American politics have fueled the incarceration revolution. In many areas of political life, politicians have used fear and sensationalism as pathways to election.</p>
<p>Data is certainly not king in the public arenas. Incarceration is far cheaper when compared to mental hospitalization, and in every political race in this country the pledge of “no new taxes” has become an effective route to electoral success. And further, the police, courts, and jails and prisons remain the last resort, governed by laws which make it very difficult to pass the buck, as states have done in mental health care. The buck stops inside the doors of the jails and prisons. A rational conclusion would be that we probably do not have the political will to move into a new era of revitalization of the public mental health programs. If, however, there was a chance to move away from the “incarceration revolution” and attempt to rebuild the public mental health programs, we would be wise to look to the past for some guidance as there were many excellent program models that were developed that might serve as guides to future systems.</p>
<p>We have already noted the innovative program models embodied in the federally funded Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) of the 1960s and 1970s, which were based on the principles of public health psychiatry.39 In addition, there certainly is a need for a concerted effort to rebuild and expand psychiatric inpatient capacity. This is not a call for the reconstruction of the total institutions of the past, but for an adequate number of psychiatric beds in our communities to provide the necessary inpatient evaluation, treatment, and stabilization services that form the backbone of modern acute psychiatric services. Additionally, communities need an adequate number of public sector beds in acute care facilities to provide the necessary backup to criminal justice system detainees with severe mental illnesses. In 1960, <strong>Portia Bell Hume</strong> and <strong>Edward Rudin</strong>40 described the funding received by the state of California’s mental health program from the federal government via the Hill Burton Act and from the state’s Short Doyle Act. Both of these well-known laws were designed to encourage the development of general hospital psychiatric units. We are greatly in need of similar commitments now at both the state and federal levels.41</p>
<p>Included with the need for a revitalization of inpatient mental health services is the re-development of functional civil commitment laws. In years past civil commitment was the diversion method of choice for removing individuals from the criminal justice system and transferring them to the mental health system. Civil commitment provided hospitalization for individuals suffering severe psychiatric decompensation, before their behaviors brought them into contact with the criminal justice system. For those already in the criminal justice system and charged with minor crimes, civil commitment provided the major route for diversion into the mental health system. A constructive alternative to current civil commitment laws was developed by the American Psychiatric Association in the early 1980s. This model statute was never implemented among the states,42 but it is time to review it again as it contained many forward-thinking approaches to civil commitment.</p>
<p>It is important to note that currently, and only in a few communities, mentally ill individuals charged with crimes may be diverted from jail by the developing system of mental health courts.43 These methods, although promising and somewhat effective, do not take mentally ill persons out of the criminal justice system, thus leaving them vulnerable to the heightened stigma associated with such involvement.</p>
<p>In closing, although this article has focused a great deal of attention on inpatient care, it is important to conclude by acknowledging that it is the outpatient, residential, and occupational components of a mental health program that really comprise the core of services. All inpatient treatment are only in the service of a rapid reintegration of individuals into their communities, and into as productive situations as they are capable of achieving. Great strides have been made in these areas, but these advances cannot be realized without adequate support. Perhaps this will ultimately come from national mental health parity legislation. Perhaps adequate or even excellent out- patient care will come ultimately from a functional national health insurance program, or perhaps from a separate national mental health policy, but it must come as the central focus of a comprehensive mental health program if the national mental health plan is to be successful.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/susan_nielsen/index.ssf/2012/10/mental_illness_in_portland_he.html">Editorial column by Susan Nielson of The Oregonian, October 7, 2012</a></p>
<p>A disheveled man boarded the Hawthorne bus one morning last week and sat near the front, agitated and in some kind of pain. The debris on the back of his coat suggested he slept outside the night before, and perhaps many nights before that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/TRIMET-2602.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/TRIMET-2602-170x300.jpg" alt="" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="170" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17158" /></a></p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the bus driver kicked the man off the bus. The rest of us made it downtown, but he didn&#8217;t. Though nothing terrible happened, there&#8217;s nothing like sharing a bus with someone in poor mental health to raise some hard truths about his journey.</p>
<p>The bus that morning was like any other day, crowded with office workers and Portland State students. Two women came aboard and said a man at the bus stop had been harassing them. The man boarded and announced that he needed to reach the hospital to have some sutures removed. Then he eyeballed the rest of us.</p>
<p>The commuters got very interested in their reading material. No eye contact: It&#8217;s the first rule of thumb when in an enclosed space with an unsettled stranger.</p>
<p>The man sat there vibrating with discomfort. Before long, he punctuated the air with random remarks and expletives that triggered a warning from the bus driver. A few riders moved farther away. Meanwhile, a bridge lift brought traffic to a halt and made the bus&#8217;s interior feel more confined. What happened next is fuzzy in my mind, but the man got into a short but tense exchange with a fellow passenger that ended with each of them threatening the other at close range.</p>
<p>At some point, the bus driver warned that a police car was nearby and officers could be summoned. It never came to that, thankfully. After several deft attempts to help the man stay calm, the driver asked him to leave &#8212; and then just like that, the man was gone.</p>
<p>A couple riders briefly applauded. Like a big jerk, so did I.</p>
<p>When you live in a city of any size, social problems are part of the urban landscape. People who appear to be homeless and mentally ill are passing time in the city parks, scavenging for cans in the neighborhoods and panhandling near the transit lines. You forget that these people are not extras in the movie of your life, adding some interesting grittiness to the background. You forget that many are suffering in ways you don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>But sometimes, people with visible problems aren&#8217;t on the other side of the park, but four feet away, right in front of your face.</p>
<p>This is doubly true during an economic downturn, when long-term unemployment and housing problems push more people toward the margins. Oregon&#8217;s rate of homelessness is third highest in the nation, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and homelessness raises the risk of minor and manageable mental health problems developing into major and chronic ones.</p>
<div id="attachment_17157" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 149px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img_1169.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img_1169.jpg" alt="David Hidalgo" title="David Hidalgo" width="149" height="211" class="size-full wp-image-17157" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Hidalgo</p></div>
<p>You see this in Portland and in cities across the country, said <strong>David Hidalgo</strong>, director of Multnomah County&#8217;s mental health and addiction services. Each person in obvious distress brings up some uncomfortable questions, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do we do to get this person help? Who is responsible for this guy?&#8221; Hidalgo said. &#8220;We go to work, we go home to our families, and who knows where he goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Multnomah County, like the rest of Oregon, is trying to strengthen its safety net. Through more outreach and better coordination of health care and social services, the goal is to keep more people out of crisis, on their medication, in stable housing, out of the emergency rooms and, ideally, employed. A secondary goal is to live up to the promise of deinstitutionalization, which was supposed to move people out of psychiatric wards and into the community, where they could thrive with enough support.</p>
<p>The safety net does save lives, but it&#8217;s nowhere near meeting the needs. As a result, we have police officers responding to endless mental health calls and bus drivers doubling as counselors.</p>
<p>The next morning, I asked the bus driver if the incident was stressful. He shrugged, all nonchalant in his mirrored sunglasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes up, and you have to deal with it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right, of course. It comes up, and you deal with it. This confrontation on the bus was minor in the scheme of things. This particular man was likely harmless, like the majority of people in poor mental or physical health.</p>
<p>What sticks with me now is that this man said he needed to get to a hospital. He probably needed to reach his destination more than anyone else on the bus, yet he lacked the capacity to ride without getting kicked off. Maybe he reached the hospital eventually, and maybe he was connected with social workers and housing specialists who will help him transform his life. But I fear he got on another bus, and another bus after that, without going anywhere at all.<br />
<em><br />
Multnomah County&#8217;s 24-hour crisis line number for people who need help, or are concerned about someone in crisis, is 503-988-4888. </em></p>

				<h2>Police identify victim of fatal officer-involved shooting</h2>
<p>The man who was shot by police Sunday evening was identified today as <strong>Chase Hammer</strong>, 27, of Salem.</p>
<div id="attachment_17152" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chase-Hammer.jpg"><img src="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chase-Hammer.jpg" alt="Chase Hammer" title="Chase Hammer" width="300" height="375" class="size-full wp-image-17152" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chase Hammer</p></div>
<p>Hammer was shot and killed Sunday after police encountered an armed man outside of a residence in the 3700 block of Scenic View Drive SE.</p>
<p>Police responded to the residence after Hammer&#8217;s girlfriend called police at 6:26 p.m. to report Hammer was despondent, was threatening to kill himself and had left with a gun, police said.</p>
<p>During the encounter, Salem Police Corporal <strong>Ryan Demmer</strong> shot Hammer at approximately 7:53 p.m. The man was pronounced deceased at the scene.</p>
<p>Salem police spokesman <strong>Dave Okada</strong> said that Hammer did not respond to Demmer&#8217;s commands to drop his weapon.</p>
<p>Oregon State Police are conducting an independent investigation into the shooting, which is a standard procedure. The involved officers have been placed on administrative leave.</p>
<h2>Police shoot and kill man holding gun in Salem</h2>
<p>From KATU.com, October 21, 2012</p>
<p>Authorities say a Salem police officer shot and killed a 26-year-old man who refused repeated warnings to drop his firearm.  </p>
<p>Police say the incident began Sunday evening when a woman called police and reported her boyfriend had a gun and was threatening to kill himself.  </p>
<p>Officers responded to a home near Ewald Avenue SE and Scenic View Drive SE. They located the man outside of the home and repeatedly told him to drop his gun.   Police said Corporal Ryan Demmer shot the man when he failed to comply.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very quiet, you know, friendly neighborhood,&#8221; a neighbor told us. &#8220;Nothing has ever happened like this before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who was shot was later identified as 27-year-old Chase Hammer from Salem. He was pronounced dead at the scene. No one else was hurt.</p>
<p>Cpl. Demmer was awarded the Medal of Valor along with two other officers in 2003 for saving a woman from a burning home.</p>
<p>Police said Demmer will be placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard procedure, while an investigation into the shooting is conducted.</p>
<p>On Saturday, police shot and killed an attacking pit bull in NE Salem. A man was shot in the foot in that incident. No officers were hurt.</p>
