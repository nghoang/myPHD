			<h2>ANALYSING MANIFESTOES HEALTH</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Even at independence we had challenges around especially infant and maternal mortality. I can remember from one of the Independence Day recordings, Late Madam Ella Koblo Gulama lamenting on it. Well over 50 years on we are still saddled with it as a nation. When President Koroma launched the Free Health care Initiative on Independence Day 2010 it was indeed a great step in the right direction. However soon after, the challenges in the health sector were laid bare for all to ponder on but the government doggedly carried it on to the delight of all. Unfortunately although the Initiative serviced so many people especially our compatriots who could not otherwise pay for health services, we have not succeeded in reducing both maternal and infant mortality. Definitely the health sector is a major campaign issue and indeed the two main parties give it priority.<br />
The APC manifesto lauds the progress made. They say the infant mortality rate in 2007 was 158 deaths per 1000 and by 2011 it stood at 78 deaths per 1000 children. In 2010 Sierra Leone was presented with an MDG award for its leadership and progress in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Salaries of health workers have also been improved. In addition there are various training services and courses to improve the skills of the health workers and Health facilities are being increased and better staffed.<br />
Well the main opposition SLPP challenges this. This is what the SLPP says in its Manifesto: Although the efforts of the APC for launching the free Health Care have been lauded, the outcome indicators show no improvement in the health status of a child. According to a Unicef International report,  Committing To Child Survival- A Promise Renewed 2011, the under-five mortality rate rose from 140 per 1000 births in 2008 to185 per 1,000 in 2011, putting Sierra Leone at the bottom of the child survival league table.<br />
The SLPP Manifesto highlights other issues like leakages in the procurement and distribution of drugs, inadequate and irregular supplies, limited staffing and distances to treatment centers limit the efficacy and impact of the free health Care System. The SLPP also feels the APC lacks any mechanism to sustain the initiative especially as the Initiative is currently funded by donors.<br />
Well the elections are round the corner and people want strategies from the parties to improve on the situation.<br />
The APC is cognisant of the challenges that the free Health care faces. In their Manifesto they say that service provision by the public sector on which the bulk of the population depends though improving is still in its infancy. It involves mainly curative care for inpatients and outpatients on a fee-for-service basis with the relatively new exception of pregnant women, lactating mothers and under five children within the Free Health Care Initiative. The poor especially in rural areas often resort to Traditional Healers and Traditional Birth Attendants for a significant amount of their deliveries.<br />
The system of health service delivery is pluralistic as it accommodates partnership amongst Government, religious missions, local and international NGOs, the private profit-making sector and traditional practitioners in providing services to the population. While the private health facilities which cater for the haves are relatively efficient, service provision by the public sector on which the bulk of the population depends though improving is still in its infancy. It involves mainly curative care for inpatients and outpatients on a fee-for-service basis with the relatively new exception of pregnant women, lactating mothers and under five children within the Free Health Care Initiative.  The poor especially in rural areas often resort to Traditional Healers and Traditional Birth Attendants for a significant amount of their health care needs. The party is committing itself to reducing the inequalities in the health sector and improve the health of the people.<br />
They also hope to improve the nutritional status of its citizens. According to their manifesto, the APC has the following key strategies to address the challenges: Progressively increase annual allocations of GDP to Health and nutrition services; Enforce stringent coordination of programmes and partners within the sector for synergy; Enforce strict adherence to the code of conduct with sanctions for practitioners; Increase number of qualified general practitioners, ensure their efficient deployment across the country and encourage training of specialists at secondary and tertiary health care levels; Improve conditions of service and quality of work environment in the sector to increase the attraction and retention of specialists and general practitioners; Improve the spread, quality and functionality of medical and nutrition facilities including existing ones to increase access and utilization of the services for our people; Encourage the participation of well meaning private medical agencies in the delivery of health services; Strengthen the regulatory functions of the Sierra Leone Medical and Dental Council and the Pharmacy Board; Put in place an effective management information system to guide forecasting and quantification of drugs and other requirements.<br />
For their part the SLPP shares quite a lot with the APC in efforts to improve the health system.<br />
They hope to implement a universal health insurance scheme that caters for the whole population. Other key fresh strategies include the following; the current free Health Care scheme will be extended to include all under 18; The SLPP Government will also increase budgetary allocation to 15% of the national budget according to the Abuja Declaration; Make functional the Health Service Commission; Increase supply of bed nets to households; Encourage local Councils to privatize garbage collection and the cleaning of Freetown and the Regional townships. Encourage recycling and incinerator facilities and waste to energy projects; Encourage Local Councils to re-introduce sanitary inspectors; Improve governance and leadership in the health sector; improve health Information system.<br />
As you can see the two parties are very much concerned with the state of the health services and have come forward with a lot of strategies to move things forward.<br />
Both parties seem to have learnt many lessons from the past four years of implementation. Health is the area where the two parties do not seem to disagree much are both determined to face the challenges. I think the health area is one of the most clearly thought out.  What we have to remember is that the success of the health system will depend to the individual&#8217;s attitude&#8230;we have to be ready to play our part as citizens. Let us learn not only to do the right things, but also to do the right thing. One area that remains yet to tackle is access to medical facilities in the hard to-reach areas in the country.<br />
