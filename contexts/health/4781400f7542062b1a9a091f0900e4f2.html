The HGH Formula is the most advanced natural health system available anywhere on the internet.<BR>
We've helped thousands of people achieve natural health and satisfaction that are integral to overall health and well-being.<BR>
Human growth hormone is produced in the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, a pea-sized organ suspended just below the brain, which produces no fewer than nine different hormones. Between them these hormones regulate a number of essential physiological functions, including water and energy balance, reproductive activity and the workings of many other glands in the body. Growth hormone is a powerful anabolic hormone that occurs naturally in the human body. It is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain and stimulates the growth of muscle, cartilage, and bone. It is made throughout a person's lifetime but is more plentiful during youth. It stimulates growth in children and plays an important role in adult metabolism. Scientists first isolated HGH in 1956. Three years later, NHS doctors began to use it in the treatment of children suffering from stunted growth. Before the advent of genetic engineering, the only source of HGH was human corpses. The pituitary glands were removed from cadavers, processed and the hormones made available in injectable form. Synthetic HGH can now be made in unlimited quantities in the laboratory.<BR>
The best approach for substantial size gains is to combine both a natural health such as HGH Formula with one of the following herbal formulas.

HGH can help to stimulate the rejuvenation and repair of your brain cells. HGH also affects the proteins produced in the brain for storing your memories. HGH deficiency has been directly related to the impairment of both long-and short-term memory as well as hand-eye coordination.<BR>
Heart failure reversal - In a 1996 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, HGH was given to seven patients - five men and two women with moderate to severe heart failure. They experienced increased thickness of the left ventricular wall, an enhancement in the ability of the heart to contract and pump blood, reduced oxygen requirement of the heart, improved exercise capacity and an enhanced quality of life.<BR>
According to Dr. Ronald Klatz and Dr. Robert Goldman of the American Academy fo Anti-Aging Medicine, HGH can "reduce body fat by 14.4 percent after six months, without dieting." Increased Muscle Mass - Dr. Klatz and Dr. Goldman as stating HGH causes "an average gain of 8.8 percent in muscle mass after six months, without excercise."<BR>
Better body contour - HGH may be the most effective fat-loss regimen ever discovered. Raised levels of HGH can re-contour the body, melting away fat and building muscle. In two studies performed by Dr. David Clemmons, chief of endocrinology at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, elevated HGH levels combined with dieting caused a 25% acceleration in the rate of fat loss, above and beyond the effect of dieting alone. In 11 weeks, the subjects lost between 20 to 32 pounds of fat while maintaining their body tone.

		<H2 Align=left>Testimonials - natural health</H2>

		<I>"I've spent fortunes on face creams and anti-aging serums? but using GenF20 HGH is the first time I've tried turning back the clock from the inside out. It's also the last time I'll spend a fortune on face creams! Thanks for this great product" - <B>Karen B., Americus, GA</B></I>
<P>
<I>"In my 20s, I was a model and commercial actress in TV ads. Everything depended on my looks and ability to be beautiful at all hours and in all conditions. As I got older, I despaired of ever looking great again, but GenF20 HGH is my secret potion. Conservatively, I'd say I look 10 years younger than my real age now (which I guess I do not have to reveal anymore!)". - <B>Liza S., Appleton, WI</B></I>
<P>
<I>"Hi, I've heard many opinions regarding the benefits brought by Hgh and I was both skeptical and interested at the same time. I just turned 59 this year, and I must say the years are getting to me. I have wrinkles on my face and my arms, I've tried using the anti-aging cream offered by infomercials, but nothing worked. Now I'm 4 months into taking hgh and I admit, I'm happy and very much impressed. Even my daughter wanted to start using hgh spray as a precaution. Thank you for the great help." - <B>Irma, Richmond, VA </B></I>
