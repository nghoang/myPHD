					<p><span style="font-weight: bold; display: block;"><br><strong>Behavioral Health Department Faculty and Founding
Chair</strong></span><strong><br><span style="font-weight: bold; display: block;">University of San
Francisco</span></strong><br><strong>Department:</strong> School of Nursing &amp; Health Professions<span> <p><strong>Job Type:</strong>
Full-Time</p> <p><strong>Job Summary:</strong></p> <p>The University of San Francisco (<span class="caps">USF</span>) is searching for a
senior faculty member to serve as Founding Department Chair for its new Behavioral Health Department (<span class="caps">BHD</span>). The
faculty position carries with it an expectation for excellence in teaching, scholarly productivity, and academic and professional service,
with time release for administrative responsibilities. The BH Department awards two degrees, the Doctor of Psychology (PsyD), designed to
prepare culturally competent clinical psychologists with an emphasis in behavioral health and a focus on underserved populations and the
Master of Science in Behavioral Health (<span class="caps">MSBH</span>), structured to enable graduates to integrate physical and
psychological factors to address complex health-related behavioral challenges in diverse communities at a systems’ level. The <span
class="caps">BHD</span> has evolved out of an interprofessional collaboration between the School of Education, the College of Arts &amp;
Sciences, the School of Nursing and Health Professions, and Counseling and Psychological Services at <span class="caps">USF</span>.</p>
<ul><li> 	Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) in Clinical Psychology </li></ul>The PsyD is an interprofessional program that prepares graduates as
clinical psychologists. Graduates are proficient in the empirical and theoretical underpinnings of integrated, behavioral health
interventions while sensitive to contextual, cultural, spiritual, and socioeconomic environments of individuals and communities. Advancing
the Mission of the University of San Francisco, the Program emphasizes behavioral health to address disparities in the delivery of physical
and mental health services to underserved and marginalized individuals. The PsyD is one of two degrees in the Behavioral Health Department
in the School of Nursing and Health Professions at the University’s Hilltop Campus in the heart of San Francisco. The PsyD program has been
approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (<span class="caps">WASC</span>). While <span class="caps">APA</span>
accreditation cannot be pursued until the fourth year of program implementation, the curriculum and clinical training requirements have been
designed to meet the standards of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (<span class="caps">ASPPB</span>), and the
Guidelines &amp; Principles on Accreditation of the American Psychological Association (<span class="caps">APA</span>).  <ul><li> 	Master of
Science in Behavioral Health (<span class="caps">MSBH</span>) </li></ul> <p>The <span class="caps">MSBH</span> at the University of San
Francisco prepares graduates to integrate physical and psychological factors to address health disparities within healthcare delivery
systems. A degree for the non-clinician, graduates are equipped to work collaboratively with other health professionals to analyze and
address complex health-related behavioral challenges in diverse communities. The preparation has a population focus and emphasizes
evidence-based strategies for promoting behavioral health. Upon completion of the program, graduates will have the tools to improve access,
delivery, and evaluation of health services.</p> <p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p> <p><strong class="hej_hdr">Essential
