SENIOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS (IT) ADVISOR<br> 
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<p></font></center></b>
The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator is seeking a Senior Information 
Systems (IT) Advisor in Washington, DC.  The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS 
Coordinator (S/GAC) is responsible for implementing the U.S. President's Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) - the U.S. Government initiative to help save the lives 
of those suffering from HIV/AIDS around the world.  This historic commitment is the 
largest by any nation to combat a single disease internationally, and PEPFAR 
investments also help alleviate suffering from other diseases across the global health 
spectrum.  PEPFAR is driven by a shared responsibility among donor and partner 
nations and others to make smart investments to save lives.  Thanks in large part to U.S. 
leadership, tremendous progress has been made in the fight against global AIDS.  
PEPFAR is supporting countries in providing HIV prevention, treatment and care to 
their people.  As the cornerstone of the U.S. President's Global Health Initiative (GHI), 
PEPFAR represents U.S. leadership in meeting the shared responsibility of all global 
partners to make smart investments to save lives.  With a special focus on improving the 
health of women, newborns and children, the Global Health Initiative's goal is to save 
the greatest number of lives by increasing and building upon what works and supporting 
countries as they work to improve the health of their own people.  The U.S. Global 
AIDS Coordinator, who reports directly to the Secretary of State, oversees and directs 
all resources and activities of the U.S. Government to implement PEPFAR and combat 
the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, including U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and relations with other countries and 
multilateral organizations.  S/GAC leads an integrated U.S. global HIV/AIDS 
prevention, treatment and care program; works with partner governments; multilateral 
organizations; the private sector; faith-based and non-governmental organizations to 
foster engagement in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and ensures that U.S. Government 
policies are harmonious, programs are synergistic, and operations are efficient and 
effective.  Additional information about S/GAC and PEPFAR is available at 
www.pepfar.gov.  Introduction: This position is located within the Strategic Information 
(SI) unit of the Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator (S/GAC).  Strategic 
Information assures accountability of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR) and the development of communication of knowledge-based practices to 
improve program performance.  SI is responsible for the systematic definition, 
collection, storage, analyses and reporting of information about PEPFAR's progress in 
reaching its goals and about the impact of programmatic activities funded to reach these 
goals.  Strategic Information covers a number of technical and science areas, including 
surveillance, health management information systems, program monitoring and 
evaluation, targeted evaluations and SI capacity building.  It includes all Emergency 
Plan countries, both focus and other bilateral countries.  To achieve these goals, SI: 1) 
Provides leadership in the development and implementation of the annual Country 
Operational Plan and Results (COPR) System, specifically by ensuring content and 
guidance consistent with PEPFAR policy; 2) Coordinates SI activities with international 
donors and organizations by participating in meetings, reviewing and analyzing relevant 
position papers, harmonizing country HIV data and organizing communications around 
common SI issues; 3) Coordinates U.S. Government reviews of COPs and 5 Year 
Strategy strategic information sections and of program targets; and 4) Provides analyzed 
information including targets and results for S/GAC Annual Plan, State Department 
BBP, and PARTs.  PEPFAR calls for immediate, comprehensive and evidence-based 
action to turn the tide of global HIV/AIDS.  Numerous agencies are tasked with 
implementing programs to address this commitment.  USG participating agencies 
develop, implement, monitor and support programs in resource-constrained countries to 
deal with this pandemic.  Health information systems (HIS) activities are a key 
component of PEPFAR Strategic Information (SI) programs.  At the facility and 
community level, HIS assist health care workers in providing high quality and timely 
care.  At the national, regional and headquarters level, HIS assist public health 
managers in finding answers to key questions about the state of the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic, the delivery and process of prevention, care and treatment services, the 
effectiveness of these services, the capacity needed to improve programs, as well as to 
plan and report and reach goals impacting the epidemic.  Many countries lack robust 
information systems and the related information and communications technology 
infrastructure (ICT) needed to access and report high-quality data.  Wherever possible, 
PEPFAR HIS activities build on existing data and information system standards and 
infrastructures in program countries.  HIS activities target the design, development, 
implementation, operations, maintenance and evaluation information systems and 
technologies.  The HIS Senior Advisor supports and reports to the Health Information 
Systems Coordinator in S/GAC.  Responsibilities include providing the USG team, 
Ministries of Health, and other implementing partners with technical recommendations 
and expertise in the design, development, improvement, and maintenance of 
information systems that strengthen health service effectiveness and efficiency.  The 
position requires both advisory and managerial acumen, including IS technical 
expertise, results-oriented analysis, clear communication, and close collaboration with a 
wide variety of stakeholders including USG Headquarters personnel, host ministries, 
PEPFAR country teams, implementing partners, and donors. Due to the highly 
integrated nature of HIS in all PEPFAR programmatic decision making, the Senior 
Advisor may be requested to advocate IS issues with any and all of these stakeholder 
communities.  Major Duties and Responsibilities: Program Management: The IS Senior 
Advisor supports the HIS Coordinator in contacts between S/GAC and implementing 
agencies by analyzing existing management information systems and recommending, 
both orally and in writing, priority strengthening initiatives.  The Senior Advisor also 
assists with the coordination of strategic partners involved in these initiatives including 
the larger USG team, multi-stakeholder technical working groups, and host country 
Ministries of Health (MOH).  In close coordination with S/GAC and agency SI 
colleagues, technical leads and program managers for prevention, care, treatment and 
other PEPFAR-funded programs, the incumbent coordinates and contributes to the 
design and development of information systems strategies.  These systems and 
strategies are intended to improve data storage, use and flow from patient-level facility-
based systems to integrated national and regional information systems.  The IS Senior 
Advisor ensures the presence of adequate administrative controls, information and data 
quality, procedural efficiencies and adherence to internationally recognized information 
system and standards for interoperability.  As requested by the HIS Coordinator, the IS 
Senior Advisor provides technical advice to PEPFAR country teams, Ministries of 
Health, and other governmental and non-governmental organizations to assist with 
systems selection, and determination of goodness of fit/ ease of use and interoperability.  
The Senior Advisor also assists with data quality and data analysis techniques where 
appropriate.  The Senior Advisor is expected to remain current in the principles and 
practices of information technology and shares this updated technical information 
within the PEPFAR community.  The IS Senior Advisor also responds to requests for 
specialist-level advice and assistance in the area of IS policy, strategic planning, 
development and implementation, as well as in monitoring and evaluation.  This 
advisory role inspires other collaborative organizations engaged in HIV/AIDS programs 
and across health programs to adopt appropriate IS standards and adhere to normative 
guidelines for their program activities.  Administrative Management: Working closely 
with the HIS Coordinator and S/GAC colleagues, the IS Senior Advisor assists with the 
technical oversight of the FACTS Info system and related program management 
systems and components.  The IS Senior Advisor coordinates activities within and 
between contractors and grantees under contractual mechanisms designed to provide 
critical mission and program support.  The Senior Advisor prepares regular and ad hoc 
written progress reports on PEPFAR HIS activities, makes oral presentations to agency 
and other officials on the progress of HIS program activities, and maintains files and 
records specific to these activities and programs.  The Senior Advisor also collaborates 
with the HIS Coordinator to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and security of 
information in the databases, particularly as related to named individuals.  Interagency 
Coordination: Due to the highly integrated nature of HIS to all PEPFAR programmatic 
decision-making, the Senior Advisor plays an active leadership role in PEPFAR 
Technical Working Groups (TWG).  As requested by the HIS Coordinator, the Senior 
Advisor attends other technical, policy and strategic planning meetings, including 
meetings with collaborators and donor agencies.  The Senior Advisor may brief senior 
agency officials, PEPFAR country team and officials of other USG agencies as 
appropriate and may attend administrative and strategic planning meetings.  These 
meetings will generally include all USG PEPFAR implementing agencies (Departments 
of State, Defense, Labor, Commerce, and Health (including Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, Food and Drug Administration, USAID and Peace Corps).  
The purpose of such meetings is to coordinate USG efforts to target most urgent IS 
needs and to avoid overlap of IS support.  Performs other related duties as assigned.  
REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: Education: Master's degree (or equivalent) in one of 
the following disciplines is required: Information Systems, Health Information 
Management, Computer Science; Computer Engineering, Information Systems or 
related field.  Work Experience: Five years of experience in designing, developing,

managerial level is required.  Health information system experience preferred.  Job 
Knowledge: The incumbent must possess extensive knowledge of information systems, 
health information technology and applications, especially in the application of program 
management data and systems as it pertains to the improvement of program operations.  
The incumbent must have a detailed understanding of the structure and functions of 
PEPFAR, including knowledge of PEPFAR agencies' roles and functions in support of 
the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  The Senior Advisor must 
also demonstrate good working knowledge of team management techniques to plan, 
organize and direct multi-disciplinary project teams and activities.  Skills and Abilities: 
The incumbent must possess the ability to analyze and understand new management 
information systems, as well as ICT program design, management and implementation 
approaches.  The incumbent must possess the ability to oversee the design or 
modification of sophisticated computer applications to meet data collection 
requirements.  Strong oral communications skills are required to develop and maintain 
effective, sustainable working relationships with USG, host ministry, national and 
international working partners. Good writing skills are required to report on various IS 
activities.  Good leadership skills are required to operate independently with limited 
direct supervision of day-to-day activities and to lead results-driven project teams and 
workgroups.  The incumbent is expected to exercise tact and diplomacy in applying 
PEPFAR guidelines in public health settings, as the programs are highly complex and 
can be threatening to stakeholders.  Highly developed persuasive skills, ingenuity and 
innovation are required.  A Secret clearance or an ability to obtain a security clearance 
at this classification level is required.  This is a contract position.  The annual salary 
range for this position is $95,000 to $115,000. (Actual pay will be set within the range

TECHNICAL ADVISOR III: SENIOR MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
ADVISOR<br>
WASHINGTON, DC
<p></font></center></b>
The Global Health Fellows Program II is seeking a Technical Advisor III: Senior 
Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor (GHFP II-P1-046) in Washington, DC.  
Assignment: Two year fellowship.  The Global Health Fellows Program (GHFP-II) is a 
five year cooperative agreement implemented and managed by the Public Health 
Institute in partnership with CDC Development Solutions and Management Systems 
International.  GHFP-II is supported by the US Agency for International Development 
(USAID).  GHFP-II's goal is to improve the effectiveness of USAID health programs by 
developing and increasing the capacity of health professionals with tailored 
development opportunities.  This is accomplished through the recruitment, placement 
and support of diverse health professionals at the junior, mid and senior levels, and 
performance management and professional development activities aimed to enhance the 
technical and leadership skills of fellows.  BACKGROUND: The Health Systems 
Office (HSO) leads a network of Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) colleagues 
throughout the Bureau for Global Health (GH) in the development and implementation 
of USAID's agenda and strategy to promote effective, sustainable, country-owned 
health systems capable of promoting health, preventing disease, advancing 
reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health and nutrition; combating infectious 
diseases including HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases; and 
addressing emerging public health priorities.  The HSO leads the Agency's health 
systems research efforts including development of a research portfolio and of metrics 
and tools for measuring health systems improvements.  It tracks and aligns USAID 
resources, funds and programs for HSS to this agenda.  The HSO also works to build 
partnerships and synergies to support this agenda and strategy, including with other US 
Government (USG) agencies, host country governments, donors, the private sector, and 
civil society.  The HSO is USAID's hub for generating, capturing and sharing state-of-
the-art knowledge on the factors that contribute to strengthening health systems, 
including: experiential knowledge, complex systems thinking, service delivery, 
community engagement and outreach, governance, finance, human resources, as well as 
medical products, vaccines, and related technologies such as information systems 
(including application of information and communications technology), and public-
private partnerships.  The HSO works with other offices in GH and with USAID 
missions, regional bureaus and partners to advance HSS knowledge and innovations and 
to promote country uptake.  The HSO serves as the hub of USAID's talent management 
in HSS.  It works to grow and nurture technical expertise and intellectual capital in HSS 
within the Agency to build a cadre of USAID HSS specialists.  The HSO ensures basic 
HSS knowledge among all health officers and among health systems practitioners and 
health-related institutions in developing countries.  The HSO develops and facilitates 
recruitment, training, professional development, staff rotations and exchanges, and 
networking opportunities.  INTRODUCTION: Within the HSO, the role of the Senior 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Advisor (the Advisor) is critical to the success of the 
Office.  The Advisor coordinates and positions USAID efforts to fulfill the United 
States Government Global Health Initiative (GHI) core principles of "build 
sustainability through health systems strengthening" and "improve metrics, monitoring 
and evaluation." S/he has the unique and exciting challenge of leading Agency HSS 
stakeholders to identify expected HSS results, create efficient and cost-effective 
approaches to track progress in achieving HSS results, design and implement robust 
HSS evaluation studies, and ensure that information feeds back into Agency HSS 
implementation and builds knowledge across the Agency and development partners.  
The questions that the Advisor addresses include fundamental issues such as how HSS 
supports achievement of GHI health targets and how the HSO will know if/ when it is 
successful.  The Advisor is the M&E expert within the HSO, providing leadership and

TECHNICAL ADVISOR IV: SENIOR MALARIA TECHNICAL 
ADVISOR<br>
WASHINGTON, DC
<p></font></center></b>
The Global Health Fellows Program II is seeking a Technical Advisor IV: Senior 
Malaria Technical Advisor (GHFP II-P2-056) in Washington, DC.  Assignment: Two 
year fellowship.  The Global Health Fellows Program (GHFP-II) is a five year 
cooperative agreement implemented and managed by the Public Health Institute in 
partnership with CDC Development Solutions and Management Systems International. 
GHFP-II is supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).  
GHFP-II's goal is to improve the effectiveness of USAID health programs by 
developing and increasing the capacity of health professionals with tailored 
development opportunities.  This is accomplished through the recruitment, placement 
and support of diverse health professionals at the junior, mid and senior levels, and 
performance management and professional development activities aimed to enhance the 
technical and leadership skills of fellows.  INTRODUCTION: The President's Malaria 
Initiative (PMI) is a US Government (USG) effort led by USAID to reduce the 
intolerable burden of malaria and help relieve poverty on the African continent.  The 
goal of PMI is to reduce malaria-related mortality by 50% by a rapid scale up of a 
package of proven malaria prevention and treatment measures: artemisinin-based 
combination therapy; insecticide-treated mosquito nets, intermittent preventive 
treatment in pregnancy, and indoor residual spraying.  USAID is the lead agency for 
implementation of the PMI.  The Initiative is results-based, focused, and exhibits a high 
level of financial and programmatic accountability.  In May 2009, President Obama 
announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI), a comprehensive USG initiative to 
reduce the burden of disease and strengthen communities around the world.  The 2008 
Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, 
and Malaria Act (Lantos/ Hyde Act) authorizes up to $5 billion in additional USG 
funding for malaria prevention and control for the period FY2009-2013.  Building on 
the progress and experiences of the PMI during the past four years and the new 
approach to international health efforts laid out in GHI, PMI will work with partners to 
halve the burden of malaria (morbidity and mortality) in 70% of the at-risk populations 
of sub-Saharan Africa, thereby removing malaria as a major public health problem and 
promoting development throughout the African region.  ROLES AND 
RESPONSIBILITIES: The Senior Malaria Technical Advisor is a key member of 
USAID's PMI team, providing expert malaria-specific guidance and technical support to 
USAID, at its headquarters and in the field, with missions and PMI country teams, 
technical counterparts, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies 
providing technical leadership across the PMI portfolio.  S/he will exercise independent 
judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical 
technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps 
necessary to meet deadlines.  Specifically, the Senior Malaria Technical Advisor will: 
Provide expert malaria guidance, to USAID missions and PMI country teams for the 
development of annual country malaria operational plans.  Provide expert technical 
guidance to regional bureaus and missions involved in malaria efforts, particularly the 
PMI-targeted countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  Provide expert technical support and 
guidance to one or more PMI focus countries and participate as an integral member of 
an interagency country support team.  Lead the process to provide technical expertise 
and input to support the management and strengthened implementation of centrally 
administered programs and projects.  Serve as a primary, senior technical expert for 
stakeholders about malaria developments and USAID's role.  Facilitate exchanges 
between countries in order to share experiences, materials and capabilities, including 
best practices and lessons learned in malaria prevention and control.  Work with other 
staff in the Global Health Bureau's Office of Health, Infectious Diseases and Nutrition 
and the technical offices in regional bureaus to enhance linkages between malaria and 
other development-related activities.  Review the literature for new developments, 
promoting best practices, policies and emerging issues in malaria.  Attend technical 
meetings and workshops, and participate in relevant training events, sharing lessons 
learned with the PMI team.  Formulate recommendations for the malaria team's 
responses to new developments and emerging issues and share with colleagues, Bureau 
leadership, and missions.  Other tasks or responsibilities may be assigned based on (a) 
organizational and programming need and/or (b) the Technical Advisor's own interest.  
REQUIREMENTS: Master's degree in public health or related discipline required; MD 
or PhD in public health preferred.  Minimum fifteen years' experience in malaria and/or 
public health, with experience in health program design, implementation, coordination 
and management in developing countries, preferably in Africa, and at least five years' 
experience in an international or resource challenged setting.  Strong epidemiologic

results to practice.  Ability to provide vision and input to strategy development at global 
and country levels.  Experience collaborating with Ministries of Health and/or National 
Malaria Control Programs in Africa on the implementation of technically sound malaria 
control prevention and treatment interventions.  Demonstrated ability to work in a 
multi-site team-based organizational structure, including partners and other 
collaborators; experience with cross-cultural teams.  Demonstrated technical leadership, 
policy experience, and problem solving skills working on and providing expert 
oversight of complex projects in a highly sensitive environment.  High degree of 
judgment, maturity, ingenuity and originality to interpret strategy, to analyze, develop 
and present work and to monitor and evaluate implementation of programs.  Track 
record of working effectively with a broad range of USG personnel and partners, and in 
a team environment and communicate highly technical health information to both health 
and non-health audience.  Strong interpersonal communication and excellent oral 
communication and writing skills.  Willingness and ability to travel internationally.

TECHNICAL ADVISOR II: HIV/AIDS AND TUBERCULOSIS ADVISOR<br>
WASHINGTON, DC
<p></font></center></b>
The Global Health Fellows Program II has posted an opening for a Technical Advisor 
II: HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis Advisor (GHFP II-P2-059) in Washington, DC.  
Assignment: Two Year Fellowship.  The Global Health Fellows Program (GHFP-II) is 
a five year cooperative agreement implemented and managed by the Public Health 
Institute in partnership with CDC Development Solutions and Management Systems 
International. GHFP-II is supported by the US Agency for International Development 
(USAID).  GHFP-II's goal is to improve the effectiveness of USAID health programs by 
developing and increasing the capacity of health professionals with tailored 
development opportunities. This is accomplished through the recruitment, placement 
and support of diverse health professionals at the junior, mid and senior levels, and 
performance management and professional development activities aimed to enhance the 
technical and leadership skills of fellows.  BACKGROUND: The Africa Bureau's 
Office of Sustainable Development (AFR/SD) provides strategic guidance and 
intellectual leadership to the Africa Bureau; conducts economic, social and political 
analyses critical to the development of AFR policies, strategies, budgets and activities; 
manages and/or coordinates three Presidential and two Agency Initiatives; and provides 
technical services to AFR's field missions. In carrying out these functions, AFR/SD 
serves as the Bureau's principal liaison with African and international partners, United 
States Government (USG) sister agencies, the private sector, universities and the Private 
Voluntary Organization/ Non-governmental Organization community.  AFR/SD's 
Health Team has an annual budget of approximately $20 million, which includes the 
management of activities that support African capacity development and improving the 
quality, availability and access to health services for Africa's most vulnerable 
populations.  The Team works across all health sectors, including infectious diseases 
such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as maternal, newborn and child 
health, reproductive health, nutrition, and health systems strengthening.  The Health 
Team works in close collaboration with other USAID Bureaus, including the Bureau for 
Global Health (GH) and the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian 
Assistance, to coordinate strategic and technical support to USAID missions, program 
reviews and assessments, staff development, etc. It works closely with African and 
donor partners such as the World Health Organization's Africa Regional Office, the 
World Bank and UNICEF.  INTRODUCTION: In little more than three decades, AIDS 
has established itself as a global crisis with an estimated 33 million people infected and 
an estimated 7,000 new infections occurring daily.  Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide 
public health threat that kills approximately 1.8 million people each year, the majority 
of whom are in the lowest income quintile.  The co-morbidity rates of TB and 
HIV/AIDS are staggering and an unprecedented global response has arisen to combat 
these diseases.  Billions of dollars have been spent to provide comprehensive 
prevention, treatment and care programs for those infected and for those families and 
communities affected by HIV/AIDS throughout Africa.  The USG has been fully 
engaged in responding to these diseases and, since establishing the President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, it has been a leader in the global 
effort to combat HIV/AIDS and TB.  PEPFAR employs a comprehensive prevention, 
treatment, and care strategy, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability for 
results.  With Congressional reauthorization of the PEPFAR program in 2008 under the 
Lantos-Hyde bill, the goals for PEPFAR were expanded to include support for 
treatment of over four million HIV infected people, support for prevention of 12 million 
new infections, and support for care of 12 million people infected or affected by 
HIV/AIDS - including five million orphans and vulnerable children and a focus on 
sustainability and country ownership.  In addition to providing an unprecedented 
commitment of resources, PEPFAR has demanded a results-oriented system of doing 
business, with high levels of accountability, establishment of measureable goals against 
which progress has been tracked and evaluated, and funding decisions made based on 
performance towards these goals.  Employing public health programming experience in 
the African context, the HIV/AIDs and TB Advisor will gain an understanding and 
appreciation for the central functions of a decentralized donor agency in program 
planning, implementation and evaluation.  In collaboration with other Team members, 
the Advisor will provide technical support and oversight on strategies, activities, and 
other areas related to USAID's HIV/AIDS and TB programs in Africa.  S/he will serve 
in a liaison capacity with counterparts in the Bureau for Global Health (GH) and other 
USG agencies to ensure coordinated support for countries and sub-regions within 
Africa.  S/he will also serve as a member of the GH-AFR country team support system, 
identifying and/or providing direct support to certain African countries in the region.  
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: The primary responsibilities of the HIV/AIDS and 
TB Advisor include: A.) Serve as a technical point of contact for HIV/AIDS and TB in 
the Africa Bureau: In conjunction with other AFR health team members, including the 
Senior HIV/AIDS Technical Advisor, provide technical oversight and strategic 
guidance to the HIV/AIDS and TB portfolio in the Africa Bureau, including managing 
relevant activities within larger programs.  Maintain current knowledge of policy, 
frameworks, research and news on HIV/AIDS and TB in Africa.  Serve as 
AFR/SD/Health Team Point of Contact regarding the coordination and leveraging of 
USAID TB funds with PEPFAR resources for HIV/TB and the Global Fund TB grants.  
Participate in relevant international meetings and conferences.  Review TB components 
of Operational Plans and PEPFAR Country Operational Plans.  B.) In coordination with 
the other Africa Bureau Health Team members, serve as an HIV/AIDS and TB Health 
Team liaison with Bureau for Global Health and other USG counterparts: Collaborate

Participate in consultations and working groups with colleagues in GH and other 
Bureaus and agencies on new HIV/AIDS and TB activities, requests and initiatives that 
impact USAID Missions in Africa; and Work closely with GH and other agency and 
USG partners to ensure that all countries in the region and the sub-region receive the 
necessary technical and logistical support.  C.) Provide support to USAID's Missions in 
Africa through the country and regional mission support system: Serve as Africa Bureau 
team lead on GH Country Teams for a subset of African countries.  Along with the 
Africa Bureau's regional offices, serve as a resource person for the health programs of 
assigned countries and regional programs within the Africa Bureau.  Assist USAID 
Missions through the provision of technical and policy guidance, consultation on and 
review of strategies, program designs, operational plans, and reporting documents
