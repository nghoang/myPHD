href="event:epidermis">epidermis</a> showing? Don't worry, it should be. Your epidermis is the top part of your skin, and your skin is your body's largest and fastest-growing <a href="event:organ">organ</a>. Skin is your body's coat. It protects you. It helps you stay warm when it's cold, and cool when it's hot. Your skin keeps all your insides in, from your heart and lungs to your blood and muscles. And unless it's cut or damaged, it keeps stuff out, including <a href="event:germ">germs</a> and water. You also feel things through the <a href="event:nerves">nerves</a> in your skin.<br><br>
Doctors who are experts in caring for skin are called <a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologists</a>. Derma is the Greek word for skin. Dermatologists treat just about everything that can happen to skin, including <a href="event:rash">rashes</a>, dry skin, <a href="event:acne">acne</a> and <a href="event:skin cancer">skin cancer</a>.

Here are some cool facts about your skin and how it grows:<br><br>
<li><b>You have a ton of <a href="event:cells">skin cells</a>.</b> There are about 19 million skin cells in every inch of your body.</li><br>
<li><b>New skin cells replace old ones.</b> Your body always is making new skin cells and getting rid of old ones. Your body gets rid of 30,000 to 40,000 old skin cells every day! The skin you see now will be gone in about a month.</li><br>
<li><b>Dead skin cells are on top.</b> The top 18 to 23 layers of your skin are made of dead cells. </li><br>
<li><b>New skin cells form at the bottom of the <a href="event:epidermis">epidermis</a>,</b> which is the top part of your skin.</li><br>
<li><b>Skin cells change shape.</b> They start off kind of fat and square. Over time, they move to the top of the epidermis, flattening out as they go. When they get to the top, they flake off. </li><br>
In 1 inch of skin, you have about:<br><br>
<li><b>650 <a href="event:sweat glands">sweat glands.</a></b></li><br>
<li><b>20 <a href="event:blood vessels">blood vessels.</a></b></li><br>
<li><b>60,000 <a href="event:melanocytes">melanocytes</a></b> (the stuff that makes <a href="event:melanin">melanin</a> and gives your skin its color.)</li><br>
<li><b>1,000 or more <a href="event:nerve endings">nerve endings.</a></b></li><br>
Wow!</p>
<br><br>
Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/About/Layers/" target="_self">The Layers of Your Skin</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/About/Layers/"></a>The Layers of Your Skin</h3>Your skin has a big job to do protecting your body, so it's made to be tough and stretchy. There is a lot more to this job than it might seem. There are three main layers of the skin. <br><br>
<li><a href="event:epidermis">Epidermis</a> is the top layer of the skin, the part of the skin you see.</li><br>
<li><a href="event:dermis">Dermis</a> is the second layer of skin. It's much thicker and does a lot for your body. </li><br>
<li><a href="event:subcutaneous fat">Subcutaneous fat</a> is the bottom layer.</li><br>

<h2>Epidermis</h2><br>
Your skin's top layer, the <a href="event:epidermis">epidermis</a>, is super thin on some parts of your body (your eyelids) and thicker on others (the bottoms of your feet). The epidermis is the layer of skin in charge of:<br><br><img src="images/skin_layers.gif" align="right" height="178" width="200">
<li><b>Making new skin <a href="event:cells">cells</a>:</b> This happens at the bottom of the epidermis. The skin cells travel up to the top layer and flake off, about a month after they form.</li><br>
<li><b>Giving skin its color:</b> The epidermis makes <a href="event:melanin">melanin</a>, which is what gives your skin its color (find out more about this in <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/index.html#/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/About/Color/">What Gives Skin Its Color</a>).</li><br>
<li><b>Protecting your body:</b> The epidermis has special cells that are part of your <a href="event:immune system">immune system</a> and help you stay healthy.</li><br>

<h2>Dermis</h2><br>
A lot happens in the next layer, the <a href="event:dermis">dermis</a>. The jobs of the dermis include:<br><br>
<li><b>Making sweat:</b> There are little pockets called <a href="event:sweat glands">sweat glands</a> in the dermis. They make sweat, which goes through little tubes and comes out of holes called <a href="event:pores">pores</a>. Sweating keeps you cool and helps you get rid of bad stuff your body doesn't need.</li><br>
<li><b>Helping you feel things:</b> <a href="event:Nerve endings">Nerve endings</a> in the dermis help you feel things. They send signals to your brain, so you know how something feels if it hurts (meaning you should stop touching it), is itchy or feels nice when you touch it.</li><br>
<li><b>Growing hair:</b> The dermis is where you'll find the root of each tiny little hair on your skin. Each <a href="event:root">root</a> attaches to a tiny little muscle that tightens and gives you goose bumps when you are cold or are scared.</li><br>
<li><b>Making oil:</b> Another type of little pocket, or gland, in your skin makes oil. The oil keeps your skin soft, smooth and waterproof. Sometimes the glands make too much oil and give you <a href="event:pimples">pimples</a>. (See Acne: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Acne/" target="_self">Pimples and Zits</a>.)</li><br>
<li><b>Bringing blood to your skin:</b> Blood feeds your skin and takes away bad stuff through little tubes called <a href="event:blood vessels">blood vessels</a>.</li><br>

<h2>Subcutaneous Fat</h2><br>
The bottom layer of skin is the <a href="event:subcutaneous fat">subcutaneous fat</a> layer. This layer plays an important role in your body by:<br><br>
<li><b>Attaching the dermis to your muscles and bones:</b> This layer has a special connecting tissue that attaches the dermis to your muscles and bones.</li><br>
<li><b>Helping the blood vessels and nerve cells:</b> Blood vessels and nerve cells that start in the dermis get bigger and go to the rest of your body from here.</li>  <br>
<li><b>Controlling your body temperature:</b> The subcutaneous fat is the layer that helps keep your body from getting too warm or too cold.</li><br>
<li><b>Storing your fat:</b> This fat pads your muscles and bones and protects them from bumps and falls.</li>
<br><br>
Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/About/Color/" target="_self">What Gives Skin Its Color</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/About/Color/"></a>What Gives Skin Its Color</h3>Skin color can be everything from very pale to very dark, and many shades in between. That's because of something called <a href="event:melanin">melanin</a>, which is made in the <a href="event:epidermis">epidermis</a>. Some people call it <a href="event:pigment">pigment</a>.<br>
Here are some facts about melanin:<br><br>
<li><b>Some people make more melanin than others.</b> Everyone has about the same number of <a href="event:cells">cells</a> that make melanin, but not everybody makes the same amount of melanin. </li><br>
<li><b>The more melanin your skin makes, the darker your skin.</b>  How much melanin your body makes depends on your <a href="event:genes">genes</a>, which you get from your parents.</li><br>
<li><b>Melanin is why you get a tan or burn.</b>  When you go out in the sun, your body makes more melanin. That's because it's trying to protect you from the sun's damaging rays by deflecting or absorbing them. But melanin isn't strong enough to completely protect you, especially if you have pale skin. By the time you see your skin turn darker or get burned, it's already damaged, so trying to get a tan is a bad idea. You should always protect your skin from the sun by covering up and using <a href="event:sunscreen">sunscreen</a>.</li><br>
Because people with darker skin have more melanin, they usually don't get as wrinkly when they get older. They're also less likely to get <a href="event:skin cancer">skin cancer</a>. But even dark-skinned people can get wrinkles and skin cancer, so everyone needs to protect their skin when they go outside. Want to know more about protecting yourself from the sun?<br><br>

<h2><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/"></a>Skin Care</h2>Taking good care of your skin means you need to:<br><br>
<li><b>Keep it clean</b></li><br>
<li><b>Protect it from the sun</b></li><br>
<li><b>Care for it when it gets banged up</b></li><br>
Don't worry, it's not hard to do.
<br><br>
Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/Washing/" target="_self">Washing</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/Washing/"></a>Washing</h3>Have you ever noticed that if you don't wash, your skin gets greasy, dirty and even smelly? That gives you a clue that you should wash your skin regularly to keep it healthy. If you don't, sweat, oil and dead skin mix together with germs. Yuck! It can make you sick because <a href="event:germ">germs</a> collect on your skin and can get in through cuts and scrapes. When you wash your skin regularly, it's less likely that those germs will get inside your body where they can really hurt you.<br><br>
To keep your body clean: <br><br>
<li><b>Use mild soap and water.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Take a bath or shower as often as you or your parents think you need to.</b> Some kids take a bath or shower every day, some every other day, some a few times a week. If you have very dry skin, your parents should take you to see a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>), who can figure out the problem and tell you how often you should bathe. </li><br>
<li><b>Wash when you're dirty or smelly, like after playing sports or after being outside</b> on a hot day. </li><br>
When you get to be a teenager, you'll probably take a shower every day.<br><br>
Taking care of your skin is especially important if you have <a href="event:pimples">pimples</a>. You should:<br><br>
<li><b>Wash your face</b> twice a day with warm water.</li><br>
<li><b>Use a mild <a href="event:cleanser">cleanser</a>,</b> which works like soap to clean your skin, but is gentler so it doesn't dry it out.</li><br>
To learn more about caring for skin that has pimples, visit <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Acne/Treatment/" target="_self">Treating Pimples</a>. <br><br>
It's also important to wash your hands a lot to get rid of germs that can make you sick. Always wash your hands before you eat, after using the bathroom, after blowing your nose, and after touching your cat, dog or any other pets. The best way to do it is:<br><br>
<li><b>Use clean, warm water and soap.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Rub the soap on your hands with some water to make it lather.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Rub your hands together for about 20 seconds,</b> scrubbing all over both sides of your hands and between your fingers. If counting is boring, sing "Happy Birthday to You" twice in your head. </li><br>
<li><b>Rinse your hands with running water.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Dry your hands off on a clean towel.</b></li>

Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/Sun/" target="_self">Sun Protection</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/Sun/"></a>Sun Protection</h3>You need to protect your skin from the sun every day, even when it's cloudy. That's because the sun's damaging <a href="event:Ultraviolet Rays/UV Rays">ultraviolet</a> A (<a href="event:UVA">UVA</a>) and ultraviolet B (<a href="event:UVB">UVB</a>) rays go right through clouds. Too much sun can make your skin wrinkly and might even give you <a href="event:skin cancer">skin cancer</a>. To protect yourself:<br><br>
<li><b>Use <a href="event:sunscreen">sunscreen</a></b> with a sun protection factor (<a href="event:Sun Protection Factor/SPF">SPF</a>) of at least 30. Look for a sunscreen that protects you from both UVA and UVB rays. When a sunscreen protects against both, the bottle might say the sunscreen offers "<a href="event:broad-spectrum">broad-spectrum"</a> sun protection.</li><br>
<li><b>Cover up</b> by wearing a hat, sunglasses and clothes that cover your arms and legs, if possible.</li><br>
<li><b>Seek shade</b> when the sun's rays are strongest, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</li><br>

Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/Injury/" target="_self">Scrapes, Cuts and Bruises</a>.
<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinCare/HowTo/Injury/"></a>Scrapes, Cuts and Bruises</h3>Skin gets banged up sometimes. You fall and scrape your knee. Your finger gets a paper cut from your homework. You slide into third base and get a bruise on your thigh. It's pretty normal stuff. Here's what you should do:<br><br>
<h2>Scrapes and Cuts</h2><br>
If you get a cut or scrape, you should:<br><br>
<li><b>Wash it</b> with mild soap and water.</li><br>
<li><b>Dab a little <a href="event:antibiotic">antibiotic</a> <a href="event:ointment">ointment</a> on it</b> (you can get this at the drugstore).</li><br>
<li><b>Cover it with a bandage</b> for a day or two. </li><br>
<li><b>Change the bandage every day,</b> or if it gets wet or dirty. </li><br>
<li><b>Take off the bandage</b> when the cut starts to heal. This will help it heal faster.  </li><br>
<li><b>See a doctor if the cut or scrape starts hurting more, gets red or looks <a href="event:infection">infected</a>.</b> If the cut is deep, bleeds a lot or just looks bad, see a doctor as soon as possible. You might need <a href="event:stitches">stitches</a> to close it up and help it heal. Don't worry, the doctor will give you something so you don't feel the stitches.  </li><br><br>

<h2>Bruises</h2><br>
When you get a cut, your skin bleeds on the outside. If you fall and get a bruise, that means your skin is bleeding on the inside. If you get a bruise, put an ice pack or cold cloth on it so it doesn't swell so much. If it's a bad bruise, keep the area higher than your heart for about 15 minutes, so you don't get as much bruising and swelling. <br><br>
If the bruise is really bad, if it gets worse after a day, or if it's really painful or you get a fever, you should see a doctor right away.
<br><br>
Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Acne/" target="_self">Acne: Pimples and Zits</a>.
<h1>Skin Health and Diseases</h1><h2><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Acne/"></a>Pimples</h2>Sooner or later, almost all kids get something called <a href="event:acne">acne</a>. You might call them <a href="event:pimples">pimples</a> or zits. People in TV commercials call them blemishes. Whatever you call acne, nobody wants it. But pimples are part of growing up and usually appear when you are between the ages of 12 and 17. You might be lucky and only get a few pimples. You might get more than a few. Or you might get big bumps that hurt and cover a lot of your face. 
<br><br>

If you're like a lot of kids, you might be embarrassed by your pimples. Maybe you don't raise your hand in class even if you know the answer. Or you get shy around that cute kid at the next locker. Your pimples might make you sad, so you don't want to talk to anybody, even your good friends.   
<br><br>

The good news is you can do something about your pimples. You might just need to change the way you wash your face. Gently washing twice a day can help. There are pimple treatments you can buy at the store. If your pimples don't go away or they really bug you, your mom or dad can take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>).  
 <br><br>

If your parents want to know about how to help you with your pimples, they can visit <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/grownups/acne.html" target="_self">acne</a> for more information.

Yep, ancient Greek kids had <a href="event:pimples">pimples</a>, too! 
Before you learn what really causes pimples, let's set a few things straight. Pimples don't come from:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Eating greasy pizza, candy bars or potato chips.</b></li>
<li><b>Dirty skin (although it could make them worse).</b></li>
</ul><br>

Now, this doesn't mean it's OK to eat a bunch of junk food and never wash your face. It just means something else is causing your pimples.

If you look closely at your face in a mirror, you can see tiny holes in your skin. These are called <a href="event:pores">pores</a>. Inside the pores, you'll find:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Oil.</b></li>
<li><b>Dead skin <a href="event:cells">cells</a>.</b></li>
<li><b><a href="event:bacteria">Bacteria.</a></b></li>
</ul><br>

These things are normal and were there before you had pimples. The oil makes your hair shiny and keeps your skin from getting too dry, so it's a good thing. But then something called <a href="event:puberty">puberty</a> happens. This is a time when your body starts to change in many ways.  <br><br>

<ul>
<li>Your skin starts making too much oil.</li>
<li>The oil, dead skin cells and bacteria plug up the pores.</li>
</ul><br>
The result? Pimples.

They all start with plugged-up <a href="event:pores">pores</a>. 
<br><br>
<img src="images/blackheads.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><img src="images/whiteheads.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b><a href="event:blackhead">Blackheads</a> and <a href="event:whiteheads">whiteheads</a>:</b> Oil, dead skin <a href="event:cells">cells</a> and <a href="event:bacteria">bacteria</a> block pores and cause small bumps called blackheads or whiteheads. If a blocked pore stays open, it can look kind of black and is called a blackhead. If a blocked pore closes up, the top of the bump looks more white. So it's called a whitehead. Blackheads and whiteheads are pretty easy to treat. You probably can use stuff you buy at the store. If these are the only kind of pimples you have, it's not so bad.</li><br>

<img src="images/papules.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><img src="images/pustules.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b><a href="event:papules">Papules</a> and <a href="event:pustule">pustules</a>:</b> Sometimes the pores get so <a href="event:irritated">irritated</a> that their walls break. That causes bigger pimples that are called papules and pustules. Papules are hard when you touch them. A bunch of papules that are near each other can make your skin feel like sandpaper. Pustules are like papules except yellowish, liquid <a href="event:pus">pus</a> fills them sort of like a blister.
Papules and pustules are a little tougher to treat. Medicine you buy at the store might work. You might want to visit a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>), who can give you other treatments.</li><br>

<img src="images/acne_nodule.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><img src="images/acne_nodule2.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><img src="images/acne_cyst.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><img src="images/papules_pustules.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b><a href="event:nodules">Nodules</a> and <a href="event:cyst">cysts</a>:</b> When blocked pores get more irritated, they get even bigger. They go deeper into your skin, too. They can really hurt. Nodules are hard. Cysts have pus and are softer. If you have these, you might be embarrassed to see people. If you have nodules or cysts, you should see a skin doctor. The skin doctor can use many treatments so you aren't stuck with these pimples.</li><br>

After pimples go away, they might leave red or dark marks on your skin. These marks fade, but it might take few days, weeks or months. Sometimes you get permanent scars from pimples. The scars can be bumps or dents in your skin. A skin doctor can help make some of those scars fade.

Ask your mom or dad to take you to the store to look for pimple medicine. There are many products you can buy that work. But you need to be patient. It can take six to eight weeks for treatment to work. Stick with it. If your face doesn't look better after 10 weeks, try something new.<br><br>
Check out the labels on pimple products. You'll probably see these big words on some of them. Here's what a few of them mean:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="event:benzoyl peroxide">Benzoyl peroxide</a>: This is the most common pimple medicine and comes in lotions, gels, <a href="event:cleanser">cleansers</a>, creams and washes. It kills <a href="event:bacteria">bacteria</a> and gets rid of some of the oil and dead skin <a href="event:cells">cells</a>. Be careful where you apply it. It can take the color out of your clothes and hair. </li><br>
<li><a href="event:salicylic acid">Salicylic acid</a>: It helps unplug <a href="event:pores">pores</a>. </li>
</ul><br>

There's also other stuff out there to treat your pimples that might work. You might hear about herbal and natural treatments, but so far there's no proof that they work.<br><br>
When you use pimple medicine:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Follow the directions</b> on the package carefully.</li><br>
<li><b>Don't use more than the directions say.</b> Don't use it more often. If you use too much, it can really dry your skin and make it red. Then you won't want to use it at all!</li><br>
<li><b>Don't use more than one treatment at a time,</b> unless a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>) says it's OK.</li>
</ul><br>

If the treatment works, keep using it, even if your pimples are gone. If you stop, your pimples might come back.
<br><br>
If none of the products you can buy at the store work, it's time to see a skin doctor for a stronger treatment. Have your mom or dad find a skin doctor near you and make an appointment. Your parents can learn more about pimples and how to make an appointment for you to see a skin doctor by visiting <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/grownups/acne.html" target="_self">Acne</a>.

Here's what you should do:<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Wash your face twice a day</b> with warm water, using a mild <a href="event:cleanser">cleanser</a>, which works like soap to clean your skin, but is gentler so it doesn't dry it out. Ask your mom or dad to help you pick one. Don't scrub hard and don't use a washcloth. That can make pimples worse. You also might have heard about special products called "scrubs." These can be too hard on your skin, so don't use them unless a doctor tells you to. If you wear makeup, be sure to wash it off before you go to bed.</li><br>
<li><b>Wash your hair regularly. </b>Greasy hair that hangs on your face can make your skin oily. You don't want more oil on your skin!</li><br>
<li><b>Only use oil-free skin care products.</b> Some packages will say the product is "oil-free." Others use big words like "<a href="event:noncomedogenic">noncomedogenic</a>" and "<a href="event:nonacnegenic">nonacnegenic</a>." All those things are good. It means the product doesn't clog your <a href="event:pores">pores</a>.</li><br>
<li><b>Keep hairspray and gel away from your face.</b> Those things can plug up your pores, too. </li>
</ul><br>

Here's what you shouldn't do:<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't squeeze or pick at your pimples. </b>You might want to get rid of your pimple, but popping it can make it worse. Also, you might get a scar where the pimple was. If you can't stand looking at the pimple, try to hide it. Oil-free makeup can help cover it up. Some pimple medicine even comes in skin color.</li><br>
<li><b>Don't touch your face. </b>Dirt and oil from your hands can get on your face. Also, touching pimples can make <a href="event:acne">acne</a> worse.</li><br>
<li><b>Don't lie in the sun or use tanning beds.</b> Neither makes pimples go away, and both can hurt your skin. If you take medicine for your pimples, the sun and tanning beds can make your skin red and dry. And be sure to use a <a href="event:sunscreen">sunscreen</a> when you are out in the sun. Just be sure it's oil-free.</li>

Actually, though, some birthmarks show up soon <i>after</i> you're born.
<br><br>

Birthmarks come in different shapes, sizes and colors and can be anywhere on the skin. Some are so little and pale that you might not even notice them. Most people have at least a few of these.
<br><br>

Other birthmarks are bigger and are purple, red or black. You might notice these more, especially if they are on someone's face. These large birthmarks might make some kids embarrassed.  Other kids aren't bothered at all. Usually a big birthmark doesn't mean there's anything wrong, though. Some kids just happen to have them. Birthmarks usually don't hurt. No one really knows what causes them. Some go away on their own, and others might stick around your whole life. If you have a birthmark that bothers you, talk to your mom or dad about it. You can ask them to take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). The skin doctor can talk to you about your birthmark and decide if it needs to be treated or if you should just leave it alone.

Good question.  Some types of birthmarks run in families, but not always. Nobody really knows why babies get them or why some kids have small birthmarks and others have bigger ones.

<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Birthmarks/Kinds/"></a>Different Kinds of Birthmarks</h3>There are two main types of <a href="event:birthmark">birthmarks</a>:<br><br>

<b>Pigmented birthmarks</b>: <a href="event:pigment">Pigment</a> is a fancy word for color. These types of birthmarks happen when you have more pigment in one part of your skin. It's like a spot on your skin. The types of pigmented birthmarks are:<br><br>

<li><a href="event:moles">Moles</a>: If you are born with a mole, it is considered a birthmark. People often call these birthmarks "beauty marks." But not all moles are birthmarks. Moles usually are small, round brown spots (no bigger than about the size of a pencil eraser), but they sometimes can be larger and can be different colors. They can be pink, skin-colored or black. Some are flat and smooth; others are raised above the skin like a slight bump. <img src="images/moles.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="150">Some moles go away, but you also might get more moles on your body as you get older. If you notice a mole that itches or bleeds, or if it looks a lot different than your other moles, ask your parents to take you to the doctor. It is important to have it checked out and make sure it's OK.<br></li>

<li><a href="event:Cafe-au-lait spot">Cafe-au-lait spots: </a>Cafe-au-lait (pronounced cafay oh lay) is French for "coffee with milk," <img src="images/cafe_spot.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="150">which is the color of these spots: kind of light brown when they're on light skin. On dark skin they can be the color of black coffee. They can be small or big and often are oval-shaped. The spots might fade as you get older, but they probably won't go away totally.<br></li>

<li><a href="event:mongolian spot">Mongolian spots: </a><img src="images/mongolian_spot.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="150">These types of spots are kind of gray-blue. They mostly turn up on the backs or bottoms of babies with darker skin. They can look like bruises. Sometimes they fade away, but sometimes they don't.
<br></li>
<br><br><br>
<b><a href="event:vascular">Vascular</a> birthmarks:</b> Your heart and <a href="event:blood vessels">blood vessels</a> — the little highways that move blood through your body — are your vascular system. Sometimes a bunch of extra blood vessels will clump together, and you can see this clump in your skin. This is called a vascular birthmark. More than one in 10 babies has this type of birthmark. The different kinds are:<br><br>

<li><a href="event:Salmon patch">Salmon patches:</a> These marks are flat and kind of pink or red (like salmon). <img src="images/salmon_patch.jpg" align="right" height="160" width="150">If you get them on your face, people call them "angel's kisses." If you get them on the back of your neck, they're called <a href="event:stork bite">"stork bites"</a> (red spots that look like bite marks — they're not, of course). Sometimes they fade away, but sometimes they don't.<br></li>

<li><a href="event:hemangioma">Hemangiomas: </a>It's a big word (pronounced he-man-gee-oh-ma), and sounds scary, but these birthmarks usually are harmless. There are two types: the kind that shows up on top of your skin and the kind that is deep in your skin. The ones on top are called strawberry hemangiomas because they're bright red and look like the fruit. Deep hemangiomas are bluish-purple and make the skin swell and bulge. <img src="images/hemangiomas.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="150">This kind shows up after a baby is born. For the first year, both types can get bigger and bigger, which can look a little scary to parents. The good news is they usually start shrinking. Most hemangiomas become flat by age 10, and many become flat even earlier. They can leave a light mark behind. <br></li>

<li><a href="event:Port-Wine Stain">Port-wine stains: </a><img src="images/port_wine.jpg" align="right" height="200" width="150">These marks often show up on the face, and they're the color of wine or grape juice: pink, red or purple. They don't go away on their own and can get bigger as kids grow.<br></li>

Or has a bee or wasp ruined your picnic when it didn't leave you alone? Sometimes insects can drive you buggy. Most aren't very dangerous, but it's no fun when they bite or sting. <br><br>

Why do they do it? Some bugs, like mosquitoes and ticks, need to suck blood to stay alive. Others, like bees, wasps and spiders, sting or bite when they think they are in danger or need to protect their homes.<br><br>

When you get a bite or sting, some bugs inject <a href="event:venom">venom</a> into your skin. Mosquitoes leave their spit in you when they bite, causing that itchy bump. Gross, huh?  
Most bug bites and stings don't hurt for very long or make you sick. But that doesn't mean they feel good. Bites and stings often make a small bump on your skin that itches, stings, swells, turns red or feels hot. If you scratch it, the bite can get red and even itchier. Sometimes bug bites can be dangerous.

Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Bugs/Kinds/" target="_self">Kinds of Bug Bites and Stings</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Bugs/Kinds/"></a>Kinds of Bug Bites and Stings</h3>So exactly what kind of bugs and other creatures bite and sting?  If you live in the United States, here's a list of some of the ones you might find around your home: <br><br>
<h2>Mosquitoes, Fleas and Other Little Biters</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>Mosquitoes like to be around pools of water, people and food. They suck your blood and make small red bumps that can get very itchy. The more you scratch, the bigger the bumps get. Almost everybody gets mosquito bites, and they are hardly ever anything to worry about. Sometimes, though, they can carry disease, so if you start to feel sick, tell your mom, dad or another adult. To learn more, visit <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Bugs/Danger/" target="_self">How to Tell if Bites or Stings are Dangerous</a>.</li><br>
<li>Fleas usually like to bite dogs, cats and other animals. This means they could take a bite out of you! The tiny brown bug leaves a small red bump when it bites and sucks blood. It itches and you might have more than one. Flea bites are annoying, but they rarely hurt.</li><br>
<li>Bedbugs are small, flat bugs that might live in your house. They can be found in any home, but they really like to live in places where a lot of people come and go, like an apartment, hotel or cruise ship. They also are found more often in warm places and houses with pets. They like to hide during the day and come out at night to suck your blood when you are fast asleep.  Bedbug bites look like tiny red bumps and feel itchy. If you scratch the bites, they might get infected.  </li><br>
<li>Chiggers are bugs that are so tiny you might need a magnifying glass to see them. They also are called mites. Their bites look like little red bumps and they make your skin very itchy. Try not to scratch, though, or the bites could become infected.</li><br>

<h2>Bees and Other Stingers</h2><br>
<li>Bees can produce sweet honey, but being stung by one is not so nice. It hurts! Some bees leave their stingers behind, so have a grown-up help you scrape it away. The sting can make your skin red, puffy, itchy or feel hot for a while. The same goes for wasp stings. For most people, bee and wasp stings hurt, but aren't dangerous. Some people, though, are <a href="event:allergy">allergic</a> to a bee's or wasp's <a href="event:venom">venom</a>.

<h2>Spiders</h2><br>
There are more than 3,000 different kinds of spiders in the United States. Most spiders only bite when they think they are in danger. The bites leave very tiny holes in your skin that you might not even see. Some of these bites can hurt a bit, itch or get puffy. Two types of spider bites are dangerous: <br><br>

<ul><li>Black widow spiders have shiny black bodies and orange or red shapes on their bellies that look kind of like an hourglass.  The black widow is small – its body is only about the size of your thumbnail – but it has very long legs. The spiders like to hide in quiet, dark places like under your porch or in your attic or basement. These bites hurt and contain poison, so tell your mom, dad or another adult if you get bitten. You need to get help right away!  </li><br>
<li>Brown recluse spiders are the same size as black widow spiders, but are brown and have a small, dark brown spot on their heads. Brown recluse spiders also hide in dark, quiet places. The bite might not hurt much at first, but it then gets sore, red, and puffy and can blister. You might need to go to the hospital to have a doctor treat the bite. </li></ul>
<br>

<h2>Ticks </h2><br>
<ul><li>Ticks are little critters – some are as small as a pencil point and their bites might cause a round, bull's-eye rash. They usually like to hang out in wooded areas that have a lot of trees and bushes. Some of these critters can cause <a href="event:Lyme disease">Lyme disease</a>, an <a href="event:infection">infection</a> that makes you feel like you have the flu.</li></ul>

Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Bugs/Prevent/" target="_self">How to Prevent Bites and Stings</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Bugs/Prevent/"></a>How to Prevent Bites and Stings</h3>The best way to deal with bug bites and stings is to try to avoid them in the first place. Here are some tips:<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Cover up: </b>If you're outdoors in places where there are a lot of insects and bugs, especially ticks, tiny bugs that stick to your skin and suck your blood, wear long sleeves, long pants and long socks. Wear boots, if you have them, and tuck your pants into them, your socks or your shoes. When you go inside, check your skin for ticks, including in your hair, under your arms, in and around your ears, in and around your belly button, at the back of your knees, between your legs and around your waist.</li><br>
<li><b>Stay away from buggy areas: </b>Keep away from insect hangouts, like flowers, trees, bushes and piles of wood. If you hike or camp in the woods, stay on the path or in clearings, and try not to brush up against the trees and other plants.</li><br>
<li><b>Spray away: </b> Have a grown-up use special sprays and lotions to keep bugs away from your skin and clothes before you go outside. Your parents can visit <a href="http://kidsskinhealth.org/grownups/bugs_protection.html" target="_self">Protecting Against Bites and Stings</a> to learn what to look for.</li><br>
<li><b>Don't panic: </b> What should you do if you are surrounded by a swarm of insects or a bee is buzzing around you? Keep calm.  Hold your arms still and walk away slowly. Do not wave your arms or try to shoo the insects away. This will scare them and they might decide to attack you. </li><br>
<li><b>Leave their home alone: </b>Never poke a stick or throw anything at a wasp's or bee's nest. If you find a nest on the ground, don't touch it. If you do, the insects will attack. If you see insects' nests or spiders' webs near your home or yard, tell your mom, dad or another adult so they can get rid of them.</li><br>
<li><b>Don't invite them for dinner: </b> Don't eat or drink near bugs. If you're having a barbecue or picnic, cover up the food. Insects love food smells, especially when the food is sweet.</li>    <br>
<li><b>Don't smell too good: </b>Insects don't just like the smell of food, they also come running or flying when they smell perfumes, lotions and creams. Be sure to use <a href="event:sunscreen">sunscreen</a> that doesn't smell good to insects.  </li> <br>
<li><b>Screen them out: </b> Keep the windows closed in your car and house, or use window screens on your house to keep the insects out. </li></ul>

Here's what to do:<br><br>

<h2>Mosquitoes, Fleas and Other Small Bugs</h2><br>

<li><b>Wash the bite</b> with soap and water.</li><br>
<li><b>Use <a href="event:calamine">calamine</a> (rhymes with "pal–of–mine") lotion</b> or another cream that will help you stop the itch.</li><br>
<li><b>Don't scratch the bites,</b> even though that's hard because they itch a lot!</li><br>
<li><b>Put ice on a swollen bite.</b></li><br>
<li><b>See a doctor</b> if your bite looks worse or you just can't stop scratching. Talk to your mom, dad or another adult about it.</li><br>

<h2>Bees and Wasps</h2><br>
<li><b>Tell a grown-up right away</b> that you've been stung.</li><br>
<li><b>Take out the stinger</b> if it's still in your skin – ask a grown-up for help.</li><br>
<li><b>Gently wash the sting</b> with soap and water. You might have to do this a few times a day.</li><br>
<li><b>Put an icepack on the sting.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Apply a paste made with baking soda and water.</b> Baking soda is something people cook with, but it also can make stings feel a lot better. Ask an adult to help you do this.</li><br>
<li><b>Ask your mom or dad if you can take some pain medicine.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Use some lotion or cream to stop the itch</b> if it's bothering you.</li><br>

Sometimes, stings can be dangerous. To learn if you might have an allergic reaction to the sting, visit <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Bugs/Danger/" target="_self">Dangerous Bites and Stings.</a><br><br>

<h2>Spiders</h2><br>
Most spider bites can be treated by a grown-up.<br><br>

<li><b>Wash the bite</b> with soap and water.</li><br>
<li><b>Put on an ice pack </b>to make it less puffy.</li><br>

If you think a black widow or brown recluse spider bit you, tell a grown-up right away. You might need to see a doctor and go to the hospital. <br><br>

<h2>Ticks</h2><br>
<li><b>Don't pull off a tick</b> if you find one on your skin, but tell your mom, dad or another adult right away.</li><br>
<li><b>An adult should grab the tick with a tweezers </b>close to your skin and pull straight up to remove the tick.</li><br>
<li><b>Carefully look over the rest of your body.</b> With your parents' help, check all over, including behind the ears, to be sure there are no other ticks.</li><br>
<li><b>Never squeeze or crush a tick, </b>because that can cause more venom to enter your body. </li><br>
<li><b>Save the tick in a jar of alcohol </b>in case your doctor wants to see it later. The doctor might be able to tell you if this is the kind of tick that can cause <a href="event:lyme disease">Lyme disease</a>, which can feel like the flu.

<h2>Allergies to Bites and Stings</h2><br>
Some people are allergic to bug venom, especially from bees. When an allergy happens, your body overreacts and sends "fighter" <a href="event:cells">cells</a> to combat the <a href="event:venom">venom</a>. This can cause some scary symptoms. If you have been bitten or stung, especially by many insects at the same time, look out for these dangerous signs:<br><br>
<li><b>Trouble breathing.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Red bumps (<a href="event:hives">hives</a>) in places where you were not stung.</b></li><br>
<li><b>A red and swollen bite that gets worse over time.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Headache or dizzy feeling.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Coughing or choking.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Throwing up or feeling as if you are going to throw up.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Pains in your chest.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Heart beating very fast.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Lips, tongue or face are swollen.</b></li><br>
<b>These are dangerous signs. Tell an adult to take you to the emergency room right away!</b><br><br>

<h2>Some Insects Carry Disease</h2><br>
Most bug bites don't make you sick, but some mosquitoes and ticks carry diseases like <a href="event:West Nile virus">West Nile virus</a>, <a href="event:Rocky Mountain spotted fever">Rocky Mountain spotted fever</a> and <a href="event:Lyme disease">Lyme disease</a>. Even though you probably won't get sick, it's still important to try to keep bugs from biting you. Know what to look for if you are bitten:<br><br>
<li><b>You feel tired all the time, or have a headache, fever or body aches.</b> You might think you have the flu.  </li><br>
<li><b>You get a <a href="event:rash">rash</a> on your skin.</b>  Days after a tick bite, you might get a red, doughnut-shaped rash where the tick bit you. This can be a sign of Lyme disease. Rocky Mountain spotted fever can cause a red to black spotty rash.</li><br>
If you notice these signs, tell a grown-up so you can see a doctor.

That you scratch like crazy and it still itches?<br><br>

A bunch of things can make your skin itch. Sometimes the itchiness happens once and goes away. But if your skin is so itchy it drives you nuts, and it happens a lot, talk to your parents. It might be something called <a href="event:eczema">eczema</a>. Another name for it is <a href="event:dermatitis">dermatitis</a>. These are big words for itchy skin.<br><br>

Lots of kids have eczema. But it can look different on different kids. You might have:
<br> 
<li><b>Red bumps </b>that are kind of scaly and feel rough and dry.</li><br>
<li><b>Bubbly, oozing skin.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Itchy skin </b>but you can't see anything on it at all! </li><br>

Don't worry about catching eczema or passing it on to your friends. Eczema isn't <a href="event:contagious">contagious</a>.<br><br>
You can't cure eczema, but it might just go away when you grow up. About half of kids who have eczema don't have it when they become adults.<br><br>
In the meantime, there is stuff you can do to keep it from being so annoying. Talk to your parents about helping you deal with your itchy skin. If it's really bugging you, your mom or dad can make an appointment with a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>).<br><br>

Doctors don't really know why some kids and adults get eczema, and others don't. They think it might happen for a bunch of reasons:<br><br>

<li><b>Family:</b> If your mom, dad, brothers or sisters have eczema, you might get it too.<br></li>
<li><b><a href="event:asthma">Asthma</a> and <a href="event:allergy">allergies:</a> </b>If you have asthma (a disease that can make it hard to breathe) or allergies (when your immune system tries to protect you from normal things that aren't hurting you), you're more likely to get eczema.<br></li>
<li><b>Where you live:</b> Eczema is more common in cities, polluted areas and in the northern part of the world.<br></li>

When you have eczema, it means your <a href="event:immune system">immune system</a> is working too hard. Your immune system usually is good, because it tries to protect you from bad stuff like <a href="event:infection">infections</a> and diseases. For some reason, when you have eczema, your immune system kind of goes crazy. So that makes your skin overreact to something and get all itchy and <a href="event:rash">rashy</a>. Weird, huh? <br><br>

If you have eczema, you might not itch all the time. It's sort of like eczema goes to sleep. Certain things wake it up and make you start itching. These things are called <a href="event:trigger">triggers</a> and you should try to avoid them if you can, especially if you've noticed that they make your skin itchy. <br><br>
 
<b>Common triggers are:</b><br><br>

<li><b>Animal saliva </b>(when a pet licks you.)<br></li>
<li><b>Scratchy clothes </b>(such as wool.)<br></li>
<li><b>Sweating a lot.</b><br></li>
<li><b>Soaps.</b><br></li>
<li><b>Household cleaning products.</b><br></li>
<li><b>Fruit juices.</b><br></li>
<li><b>Dust.</b><br></li>

When kids get eczema, they usually have either <a href="event:atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</a> or <a href="event:contact dermatitis">contact dermatitis</a>.<br><br>

<h2>Atopic dermatitis</h2><br>
When people talk about eczema, they usually mean atopic dermatitis. Atopic is a word that means your body, and in this case your skin, overreacts to something.  <br><br>
Some things to know about atopic dermatitis:<br><br>
<li><b>A lot of kids have it. </b>In fact, as many as one in 10 kids has atopic dermatitis. Some say it's more like one in five! And it's way more common than it was when your grandparents were kids.</li><br>
<li><b>It's more common in kids with <a href="event:asthma">asthma</a> and <a href="event:allergy">allergies</a>.</b> Half of all kids who have eczema also have asthma, a disease that can make it hard to breathe. And two-thirds of kids with eczema get something called hay fever, which is when something makes you sneeze a lot and get watery eyes and an itchy nose. Some kids even have eczema, asthma and hay fever! </li><br>
<li><b>It comes and goes.</b> This can happen a lot and you might not ever really figure out why.</li><br>
<h2>Contact dermatitis</h2><br>
If you have contact dermatitis, it means that things you touch – or that touch you – can irritate your skin. A lot of things can touch your skin and make it itchy. There are two reasons.<br><br>
<b>Your skin gets annoyed or <a href="event:irritated">irritated</a>.</b>  Common things that annoy your skin are:<br><br>
<li><b>Soaps.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Detergents.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Cleaners.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Paints.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Even water!</b></li><br>
<b>You might have an <a href="event:allergy">allergy</a>.</b> An allergy is when your <a href="event:immune system">immune system</a> tries to protect you from normal things that aren't hurting you. Many things can <a href="event:trigger">trigger</a> an allergy and it might be hard to figure out what they are. So far, doctors have found more than 3,000 things that can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Some common ones are:<br><br>
<li><b>Leather, glue or rubber in your shoes.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Concrete.</b></li><br>
<li><b>Perfumes,</b> even in hair and skin products.</li><br>
<li><b>Some medicines.</b></li><br>
<li><b><a href="event:nickel">Nickel</a>,</b> a metal that is in a lot of jewelry.</li><br>
<li><b>Foods</b> such as tomatoes, chocolates, nuts and soy.</li><br>
<li><b><a href="event:poison ivy">Poison ivy</a></b> and other plants such as <a href="event:poison sumac">poison sumac</a> and <a href="event:poison oak">poison oak.</a></li><br>
Anyone can get contact dermatitis, but it's more common in kids who have atopic dermatitis.

	<ul>
	<li><b>Stop scratching.</b> This is hard, but it's important because it can make eczema worse. It even can cause your skin to get <a href="event:infection">infected</a>. Also, lots of scratching can make your skin tough, like an alligator. Keep your fingernails short so that if you do scratch, it won't hurt your skin as much.</li>
	<li><b>Avoid </b><a href="event:trigger">triggers</a> (things that you know make you itchy) as much as you can.</li>
	<li><b>Put on thick cream or </b><a href="event:ointment">ointment</a> to lock moisture into your skin. The kind of cream that says it's "fragrance-free" works best (that means it doesn't have any perfume in it.) It might be a little annoying when you first put it on, but it's a lot better than being itchy. Use it three times a day if you can. Your parents can help you find one that will work best. There's even a special type called a "<a href="event:barrier repair moisturizer">barrier repair moisturizer</a>" that has something in it that gives your skin extra protection. A skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>) can tell you what to buy.</li>
	<li><b>Take warm baths or showers.</b> Keep them short, and make sure the water isn't hot, which makes eczema worse. Don't use washcloths or sponges. When you get out, pat yourself dry with a towel. Don't rub your skin. As soon as you've patted yourself off, slather cream or ointment all over your body. This works best when your skin still is a little wet.</li>
	<li><b>Try not to get too hot or too sweaty.</b> It can make your skin feel prickly.</li>
	<li><b>Wear non-scratchy clothes,</b> like those made out of cotton, rather than wool. Your parents can help you find clothes that won't make you itchy.</li>
	<li><b>Use "fragrance-free" soaps and detergents.</b> Unscented won't do it; it's got to be fragrance-free.</li>
	<li><b>Try not to stress out about your eczema. </b>It only makes it worse.  </li>
	</ul>
<br><br>
Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Eczema/Treat/" target="_self">Making the Itch Go Away</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Eczema/Treat/"></a>Making the Itch Go Away</h3>Sometimes, even if you're really good about putting on your thick cream or <a href="event:ointment">ointment</a>, you still get itchy. Don't worry, it happens.  The good thing is there's other stuff you can do to try to stop the itching. <br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Put a soft, cool, wet cloth on the itchy skin.</b> It can cool the burning and itchiness. </li>
	<li><b>Use medicine.</b> Your parents can take you to the store to buy medicine you take by mouth or cream you can put on your skin. The one you take by mouth (called an antihistamine) makes your immune system chill out and stops the itch. The other kind (called a corticosteroid) comes in a cream that you put on the skin to stop the annoying itch. You shouldn't use it for a long time, though, because it can make your skin thinner and less able to protect you. A doctor can tell you how to use it.</li>
	</ul><br>
If these things don't help enough, ask your parents to take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). The skin doctor can give you a stronger version of medicine or use another treatment. Some of the treatments are:<br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Creams:</b> There are several kinds. One stops your <a href="event:immune system">immune system</a> from overreacting. Another stops the itch.</li>
	<li><b>Pills:</b> There are several kinds of these, too. Some cure <a href="event:infection">infections</a> kids get from scratching too much. Others keep your immune system calm.</li>
	<li><a href="event:light therapy">Light therapy:</a> A special type of light can make the itchiness go away.</li>
	<li><a href="event:tar">Tar:</a> It sounds weird, but in the old days they put thick, gooey tar on the eczema. Tar is still used today and you know what? It stops the itch! Sometimes it's messy and smelly. Just like any treatment, don't use this without talking to your doctor first.</li>
	</ul><br>
Sometimes, skin doctors do tests to see if certain things are triggering your eczema. But the tests can't always figure out the problem.  And even if you can figure out a few things that <a href="event:trigger">trigger</a> eczema, your itchy skin won't completely go away. The best thing to do is to take really good care of your skin, use lots of cream or ointment, and use medicine when it gets itchy. And remember, you're not alone!

They all have an oil in them called <a href="event:urushiol">urushiol</a>, to which most people are <a href="event:allergy">allergic</a>. You can get the <a href="event:rash">rash</a> from:<br>
<ul>

	<img src="images/poison_ivy.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li>Touching the weed.</li>	
        <li>Touching something that rubbed up against the plant (like petting your dog after he brushed up against it.)</li>
	<li>Even from being near it, because the oil can get in the air.</li>
</ul><br>

As soon as you think you might have a rash from one of these plants, you should:<br>
<ul>

	<img src="images/poison_oak.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Rinse the skin right away with lukewarm water.</b></li>
	<li><b>Wash your clothes</b> and anything else you might have touched.</li>
</ul><br>
The rash will go away in a few weeks. Until then, here's what you can do:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Take a cool shower.</b></li>
	<img src="images/poison_sumac.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Take an oatmeal bath.</b> Your parents can buy a special product at the store that has oatmeal in it for the bath.</li>
	<li><b>Spread on a special anti-itch cream called hydrocortisone.</b></li>
	<li><b>Swab on <a href="event:calamine">calamine</a> lotion.</b></li>

You might even know a teenager who has a tattoo, or maybe even a pierced belly button or tongue. Here's the thing: Piercing and tattooing really aren't very safe. You can end up with a bad <a href="event:infection">infection</a> or a scar. That's why doctors say piercings and tattoos aren't a good idea for kids. Also, when you get older – believe it or not – you might think that a tattoo or piercing really isn't so cool, and wish you didn't have it.<br><br>
It's true that some kids, and even babies, get their earlobes pierced. Doctors say it's still risky, but not as much as piercing other parts of the body. You need your parents' permission to get your ears pierced. If they're OK with it, you need to make sure they find a good, clean, safe place where you can get it done. Then you have to care for them. By the way, some kids you know might have the edges of their ears pierced. This is really not a good idea because piercings on this part of the ear don't heal very well. <br><br>
Oh, and don't ever try to pierce or tattoo yourself, and do not have a friend do it for you. It's risky enough to have it done by an expert. It's way more dangerous if it's done by someone who doesn't know how to do it safely. A skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>) can give you advice and suggest how to choose a safe place to get it done.<br><br>

<ul>
	<img src="images/child_ear_piercing.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>A needle:</b> The person who is doing the piercing pokes a hole in your earlobe with a needle, and then puts in the earring.</li>
	<li><b>A piercing gun:</b> A piercing gun kind of looks like a mini staple or glue gun. It shoots the earring into your ear. Usually the earring is a "stud," which is a post with a ball on the end. </li>
</ul><br>

Both are very fast, and kind of feel like a pinch for a few seconds. Piercing other parts of the body pretty much works the same way. Most <a href="event:tattoo">tattoos</a> are done with a special electric gun. Here's what usually happens:<br>
<ul>
	<img src="images/tattoo_gun.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>The tattoo artist draws an outline of the tattoo on the skin.</b></li>
	<li><b>The gun makes very fast punctures in the skin </b>with a needle that's got ink on it. </li> 
	<li><b>The ink goes into the second layer of the skin, called the <a href="event:dermis">dermis</a>. </b>If it only went in the top layer, the tattoo would fade. Because it goes deeper, the tattoo pretty much stays there forever.</li>
</ul><br>

It takes a long time to get a tattoo, and it can hurt and bleed. Getting it removed is worse: It can take longer and hurt even more. And it costs a lot of money! <br><br>
 
Here are some other things you should know:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Children shouldn't get tattoos.</b> Doctors say because of the risks, kids should avoid them. If you like the look, why not try a temporary tattoo you can buy at the store? 

Here are some reasons they are better than permanent tattoos:</li>
	<ul>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;All it takes is a little water and a sponge to put it on.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you're tired of it, you can wash it away. Not like the real thing!</li></ul>
	<li><b>Henna tattoos can be dangerous.</b> While on vacation or at the mall, you might see some people giving henna tattoos. They are made from the leaves of a plant. These tattoos usually are brown, green or red, and don't last. Be careful, though, because some henna tattoos are longer-lasting black tattoos that contain a dangerous chemical. This chemical can cause itchy skin, blistering, or even a scar.</li>

If they do, tell your parents to make an appointment for you to see a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). <br><br>

	<img src="images/piercing_allergy.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Infections:</b> Infections are pretty common. The skin doctor will probably give you medicine to put on your ears to make them better. But some of the infections can be serious.

But if you do your best to make sure you go to a safe piercing place, you will be better off. Here's what to look for:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>A clean, safe place:</b> Be sure the place where you have your ears pierced uses special methods to keep everything <a href="event:sterile">sterile</a>. Anything that touches your ear should come out of a sealed bag and be disposable. That means it is used only on you and no one else, and thrown away. Some people say piercing guns aren't the best because they're hard to keep clean. If your piercer does use a piercing gun, be sure the part that touches you hasn't been used on anyone else.  </li>
	<li><b>Hand-washing and gloves: </b>Before starting the procedure, the piercer should wash his or her hands and put on gloves like doctors use.  </li>
	<li><b>High-quality earrings:</b> Be sure the earrings that they use are made of <a href="event:surgical steel">surgical steel</a>, <a href="event:titanium">titanium</a>, 14- or 18-karat gold or something called <a href="event:niobium">niobium</a>.

If you don't, you can get an <a href="event:infection">infection</a>. Following the care directions the piercer gives you can help to avoid infection. The piercer will probably tell you to:<br><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Leave the earrings in for six weeks or more,  </b>even at night! </li>
	<li><b>Carefully wash your ears with soap and water.</b></li>
	<li><b>Twist the earrings to keep the pierced hole open.</b> This should be done a few times a day.</li>
	<li><b>Never touch your new pierced ears unless your hands are clean.</b></li>
	<li><b>Put rubbing alcohol on your ears,</b> or use a special cream or <a href="event:ointment">ointment</a> to keep away <a href="event:germ">germs</a>.</li>
</ul><br>
If your ears get sore, red or puffy, or if yellowish liquid oozes out of the hole, tell your parents. If it doesn't go away quickly, your parents should take you to see a doctor. If you have a serious infection or it spreads, you might need to see a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>).

But don't be surprised if the hole doesn't close up. The only way to fix that hole is to have surgery, which can cost a lot of money. But if you haven't had the earrings for a long time, you might not even be able to see the hole unless you look really close.

But lots of grown-ups get skin cancer and often it's because of things they did – or didn't do – when they were kids.
<br><br>
They might have had bad sunburns. Or they got really dark tans. They didn't protect themselves from the sun when they were outside. 
 <br><br>
The main reason people get skin cancer is that they were exposed to too much sun on their skin, especially when they were young. There's no way to know for sure who will get skin cancer some day and who won't. And most kinds of skin cancer can be cured if you see it and go to the doctor right away. But if you protect your skin from the sun now, there's a better chance you won't get skin cancer in the first place. You'll also get fewer wrinkles and ugly brown spots. 
<br><br>
Here are some simple things all kids and adults should do to Be Sun Smart®:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Always slather on <a href="event:sunscreen">sunscreen</a>. </b>No excuses.</li>
	<li><b>Seek shade when the sun is really strong, </b>from about 10 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. If your shadow is shorter than you are, seek shade.</li>
	<li><b>Wear a hat </b>to keep the sun off your face, and sunglasses to protect your eyes.</li>
	<li><b>Remember that the sun can hurt your skin even if it's cloudy. </b> </li>
</ul>

But why do some people get a sunburn and others get a suntan?<br><br>
You have something called <a href="event:melanin">melanin</a> in your skin. It's the stuff that gives your skin its color. People who have dark skin have more melanin. People who have light skin have less.  <br><br>
Here's how melanin makes your skin burn or tan:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Your body normally makes melanin</b> to try to protect the deeper layers of your skin from damage.</li>
	<li><b>When your skin gets damaged by the sun's rays, it makes even more melanin</b> to try to protect your skin from being damaged even more. That causes the skin to change color:<br>
<subitems><br>
<b>Dark-skinned people usually turn darker brown,</b> or tan, when they go in the sun.<br><br>
<b>Light-skinned people usually turn more red,</b> or burn, when they go in the sun.
</subitems></li>
</ul>
Besides tanning or burning, a lot of people also get uneven patches of color, or freckles.<br><br>
Even if you have naturally dark skin or never burn and always tan, that still means the sun is damaging your skin. And you can still get skin cancer and wrinkles some day.

Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Cancer/WhatIsIt/" target="_self">What is Skin Cancer?</a><h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/SkinHealth/Cancer/WhatIsIt/"></a>What is Skin Cancer?</h3>People get cancer when some <a href="event:cells">cells</a> in the body are damaged and start growing way too fast. These growing cells make spots or bumps called <a href="event:tumor">tumors</a>. Nobody knows why some people get cancer and others don't. Lots of different things can cause cancer and sometimes doctors don't know what causes it. But they do know for sure that the sun is one of the things that causes <a href="event:skin cancer">skin cancer</a>.<br><br>
Here's what you should know about the sun, tanning beds and skin cancer:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>The sun damages your skin. </b>This happens because the sun gives off a type of light called <a href="event:ultraviolet rays/uv rays">ultraviolet rays</a> or <a href="event:ultraviolet rays/uv rays">UV rays</a>. These rays damage your skin and can give you skin cancer. <a href="event:sunscreen">Sunscreen</a> helps keep these rays from hurting your skin.</li> 
	<li><b>Tanning beds damage your skin, too. </b>Getting a tan from a tanning bed is a really bad idea. Tanning beds use UV rays, so they damage your skin just like the sun does. </li>
	<img src="images/melanoma.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b><a href="event:melanoma">Melanoma</a> is the most serious kind of skin cancer.</b> It often begins in <a href="event:moles">moles</a>. You probably have lots of moles and probably will get new ones. Moles are very common, and most are no big deal. But if you have a mole that looks really different from the others, that itches or bleeds, has a weird shape or has different colors, talk to your parents. They might want to take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>) to check it out.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The good thing about skin cancer is that it's right there on your skin, so you can see it and show it to a doctor. Then, the doctor can treat it to make it go away. Kids don't get skin cancer very often. But it can sometimes happen, so it's better to be safe and check it out.

Your skin will look better and have fewer wrinkles and brown spots. Plus, you'll be less likely to get <a href="event:skin cancer">skin cancer</a>.<br><br>

What can you do to protect your skin? It's simple:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>Slather on <a href="event:sunscreen">sunscreen:</a></b> Put on sunscreen about 15 to 30 minutes before going outside. It only takes a few minutes. Your parents can help you buy a sunscreen that has a high <a href="event:sun protection factor/spf">SPF</a>. That stands for <a href="event:sun protection factor/spf">sun protection factor,</a> and it should be 30 or higher. Look for the words <a href="event:broad-spectrum">broad spectrum</a> or <a href="event:uva">UVA</a> and <a href="event:uvb">UVB</a> rays.  You want a sunscreen that protects you from both. It doesn't matter what form of sunscreen you use. If you like spray sunscreen, that's fine. Cream, gel, lotion, <a href="event:ointment">ointment</a> and sticks all work. Whatever you like, just use it! Sunscreen wears off, so put more on after you've been in the sun for more than two hours or after you swim or sweat a lot. And you need to use it even on cloudy or cool days. Don't forget places that often are missed, such as ears, lips and eyelids. Sunscreen can sting if it drips into your eyes, so use a special sunscreen that comes in a stick and won't drip. And because sunscreen doesn't taste very good, there is special sunscreen made just for lips.</li>
	<li><b>Cover up:</b> Sunglasses protect your eyes and the skin near your eyes. Hats are great because they keep the sun off your face. Long-sleeve shirts and pants can help keep the sun off your skin, too. </li>
	<li><b>Seek shade:</b> The sun's rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Check out your shadow. If it's shorter than you are, seek shade. </li>
	<li><b>Be careful around water, sand and snow:</b> Sure, those things make being outside fun. But they can reflect UV rays and increase your chance of sunburn. </li>
	<li><b>Get your <a href="event:vitamin">vitamin</a> D from food: </b>You might have heard that your body needs vitamin D to be healthy. And you might have heard that you can get it from the sun. Both are true. But you also can get it from eating healthy food and taking vitamins, which is much better than exposing your skin to the sun.</li>
	<li><b>Stay away from tanning beds:</b> Tanning beds give you a tan the same way the sun does, with UV rays. UV rays make the skin look older and can give you skin cancer. They're bad news.</li></ul>

It can really hurt and you need to stay out of the sun until it gets better.  Here are some things that can help make you feel better:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>Put a cold, damp towel on your skin.</b> Do this for 10 or 15 minutes a few times every day. That will help take some of the heat out of your skin. You also can take cool baths. </li>
	<li><b>Apply lotion.</b> Lotions that have something called <a href="event:aloe vera">aloe vera</a> in them help make your skin feel better. Be careful not to use lotions or creams that have any of these things listed in the ingredients: <a href="event:petroleum">petroleum</a>, <a href="event:benzocaine">benzocaine</a> or <a href="event:lidocaine">lidocaine</a>. Things with petroleum trap the heat in your skin (and you don't want that!) and benzocaine and lidocaine can bother your skin.</li>
	<li><b>Use <a href="event:calamine">calamine</a> lotion</b> to help stop the itching that can happen when the sunburn starts peeling.</li>
	<li><b>Ask your parents about taking pain medicine if the sunburn really hurts. </b></li>
	<li><b>Drink lots of fluids, especially water.</b> Sunburn makes you get very dry inside, so you need to drink a lot.</li>
	<li><b>Leave blisters alone.</b> If you get blisters, don't pop them because that makes the sunburn worse. You can even get an <a href="event:infection">infection</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Tell your parents if you feel weird or sick. </b> They might need to take you to the doctor if you feel dizzy, weak, sick to your stomach, cold or just not yourself. Those things can mean the sunburn is making you really sick and you need help.</li>

Ugh! But guess what?  Lots of kids get warts. They're more common in kids, but adults can get them, too. Warts are caused by a <a href="event:germ">germ</a> called a <a href="event:virus">virus</a> but aren't serious and won't seriously hurt you. But they spread easily on your body and from kid to kid.<br><br>

If you ignore your warts, they probably will go away on their own. If you are tired of looking at them or if they hurt (especially if they're on the bottom of your feet), ask your mom or dad to help you get rid of them. You can buy some medicine at the store that might work. Or your parents can take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). The skin doctor can check to be sure that you really do have warts. If you do, the skin doctor has many treatments that can help get rid of the warts.<br><br>

The bumps might not be warts, but something like warts called <a href="event:molluscum contagiosum">molluscum contagiosum</a>. That's a mouthful! The name tells you that these bumps are <a href="event:contagious">contagious</a>. That means they spread easily, too. Like warts, a virus causes molluscum. They will go away without treatment but it can take a long, long time, like a year, or sometimes even five years. The skin doctor can treat molluscum, too. <br><br>

They won't give you <a href="event:warts">warts</a>. But warts do spread easily. You get them when your skin touches someone who has warts, or something a person with warts has touched. So that means you can get warts:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>In your house or at school.</b></li>
	<li><b>From a brother, sister or a friend.</b></li>
	<li><b>In the gym locker room.</b></li>
	<li><b>At the pool.</b></li>
	<li><b>From almost anyone or anywhere!</b></li>
</ul><br>

Because warts are so easy to catch, it's a good idea to wear pool shoes or flip-flops instead of going barefoot at the pool or other places where people walk around without shoes. Don't worry about it too much, though. Sometimes there's nothing you can do to prevent warts. <br><br>

Warts are caused by a <a href="event:germ">germ</a> called a <a href="event:virus">virus</a>. There are lots of different types of viruses. One type causes colds, another causes warts. So really, you catch the virus. The virus:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Gets into your body.</b> This can happen through a sore or opening in your skin – even a tiny cut! Try not to chew your nails because you can create a sore that lets the virus in.</li>
	<li><b>Causes an <a href="event:infection">infection</a>.</b> That infection causes the wart, which is a growth or bump in your skin. </li>
</ul><br>
 
If your brother or sister has warts, you might get them and you might not. Doctors don't really know why, but some people just get them more easily than others do. If you have warts, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. It's sort of like some kids getting more colds than others.<br><br>

<a href="event:molluscum contagiosum">Molluscum</a> is something that looks like warts, but isn't. It's also is caused by a virus, just a different type. You get these bumps the same way you get warts – from someone else.

<ul>
	<img src="images/warts_hand.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Tiny or big. </b></li>
	<li><b>White, pink, brown or the exact color of your skin.</b></li>
	<li><b>Flat, rounded, or long and skinny.</b></li>
	<li><b>Rough or smooth.</b></li>
</ul><br>
<img src="images/warts_face.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150">You might have just one or two warts, or you might get a whole bunch. You can get warts almost anywhere on your body. Some types of warts usually show up on certain places on your body:<br>
<ul>
	<img src="images/plantar_wart.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Your face:</b> Flat warts and long skinny warts that look like tiny fingers usually appear on your face.  </li>
	<li><b>The bottoms of your feet:</b> Warts that are large flat bumps on the bottoms of your feet are very common. They are called <a href="event:plantar wart">plantar warts</a> because the bottom surface of the foot is called the "plantar surface." Plantar warts sometimes hurt when you walk on them; you might feel like you have a stone in your shoe. </li>
	<img src="images/warts_fingers.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Your fingers:</b> These warts sometimes look like blisters, but feel harder. Sometimes, the warts on your fingers can make your nails grow weird. </li>
</ul><br>

Some people think warts have <a href="event:root">roots</a>, like a plant, but they don't. Sometimes warts have tiny black spots in them that look like seeds. But they aren't seeds. It's just that the blood that feeds the wart has dried. Don't worry, it's normal to get this.
<br><br>
<img src="images/molluscum.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><a href="event:molluscum contagiosum">Molluscum</a> bumps are usually small and round. They're skin-colored, pink or red. They kind of look like <a href="event:pimples">pimples</a>, but you get them in places where you usually don't get pimples. You can get them on your arms or legs, stomach or even your bottom.

It can take a long time, though. And the warts might spread. So you might want to try to get rid of them. <br><br>

Here are some treatments your mom or dad can buy at the store:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>Acid liquid or patch: </b>The most common wart treatment is a special kind of acid, called <a href="event:salicylic acid">salicylic acid</a>, to put on the wart. Don't worry. Acid sounds scary but it doesn't really hurt, although it might sting just a bit. You can paint it on the wart like polish, or your parents can buy a patch that looks like a bandage and has the acid in it. Before your parents put on the acid, you should soak the wart in warm water for about 10 minutes. Then your parents should buff the wart with something that has a rough surface, like a cardboard nail file, called an <a href="event:emery board">emery board</a>, or a special rough stone called a <a href="event:pumice stone">pumice stone</a>. That softens up the wart so the acid works better. The acid peels away the skin. Eventually, the wart will peel away, too.  </li>
	<li><b>Freezing:</b> You can freeze the wart with a really cold spray treatment you can buy at the store. The spray makes a blister around the wart. The blister and wart will eventually fall off. Don't try to freeze your warts with ice cubes!  </li>
	<li><b>Taping: </b>As weird as it sounds, some people treat warts with <a href="event:duct tape">duct tape</a>! Yep, that really sticky silver tape your parents use for odd jobs around the house might make your warts go away. Doctors don't really know why this works. In fact, some people think it really doesn't work. But if it's OK with your doctor, give it a try. Stick a piece of duct tape on the wart and then change it every few days to peel away layers of the wart. </li>
</ul><br>

While you're trying to get rid of the warts, don't scratch or pick at them. This makes them worse and also spreads them to other parts of your body. You don't want that! <br><br>

It will take time to get rid of the warts. You will have to use the treatment over and over, sometimes every day. Even then, it can take weeks or sometimes months.<br><br>

If your warts aren't going away fast enough, or are spreading, ask your mom or dad to take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). The skin doctor can try other treatments that might work better than stuff you can buy at the store. The treatments can include:
<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Acids to peel away the skin and take warts with it.</b></li>
	<li><b>Ice-cold liquid nitrogen to freeze the warts.</b></li>
	<li><b>Lasers and other equipment to burn off the warts.</b></li>
	<li><b>Special surgery to take off the warts.</b></li>
	<li><b>Medicine in a cream to smooth on the warts or in a pill to take by mouth.</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
They might even use a treatment made of beetles!
<br><br>
<a href="event:molluscum contagiosum">Molluscum</a> bumps will go away on their own. But it can take months and maybe even years. Also, there are no treatments you can use at home. So if you don't want to wait for them to go away or they are spreading, see a skin doctor.

When you injure your skin – by accident or from a surgery – your body works to repair the wound. The body creates collagen (a tough fiber in your body that gives the skin strength and flexibility) to reconnect the tissues broken apart by the injury. While the body does this work, it creates a scab over the wound. The scab protects the wound from germs as the body heals.<br><br>

When the injured skin is repaired, the scab dries up and falls off. In its place, there may or may not be a scar. If there is a scar, it can be pale pink, brown or silver.<br><br>

But just about everything else does, from your cheeks and fingers to your knees and toes, and, of course, your head.<br><br>

Some of those hairs are so tiny and so light in color that they're really hard to see. On your cheeks, they're almost like peach fuzz. Hair on your arms and legs is a little easier to see and feel, and usually gets thicker as you get older. The longest and thickest hair of all is on your head.   <br><br>

The hair on your body has some special jobs. It helps protect you and keep you warm. Your eyelashes keep dirt and dust out of your eyes. Your eyebrows also protect your eyes, and stop sweat from running into them. <br><br>

Sometimes you can have problems with your hair or your <a href="event:scalp">scalp</a> (the skin on your head) and you might need to talk to a doctor. It might sound kind of funny, but the best doctor to see for hair problems is a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). That's because hair grows out of your skin.<br><br>

Look around and you'll notice that everybody's hair is different because there are so many combinations of hair types, colors and styles. It can be short, long, curly, straight, thick, thin, blond, black, brown or red. Most of those things are decided by the <a href="event:genes">genes</a> you get from your parents.

Here's how it happens:<br><br>
<subitems>
<img src="images/hair_illustration.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><b>1.	Your hair begins growing from a <a href="event:root">root</a> in the bottom of the follicle.</b> The root is made up of <a href="event:cells">cells</a> of <a href="event:protein">protein.</a><br><br>
<b>2.	Blood from the <a href="event:blood vessels">blood vessels</a> in your <a href="event:scalp">scalp</a> feeds the root,</b> which creates more <a href="event:cells">cells</a> and makes the hair grow. <br><br>
<b>3.	The hair gets pushed up through the skin</b> as it grows, passing an <a href="event:oil glands">oil gland</a> along the way. The oil gland adds oil to the hair and keeps it shiny and soft. It can make it greasy, too. That's why you need to wash your hair. <br><br>
<b>4.	The hair dies by the time it is long enough to poke out through the skin. </b>Yes, hair is dead. That's why it doesn't hurt to get a haircut.<br>
</subitems>
Hair on the rest of your body goes through this same process, but the whole cycle only lasts for a month or so. That's why body hair does not grow very long in length like the hair on your head does.<br><br>

Here are some facts about follicles and your hair:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>You are born with all of the follicles you will ever have</b> – about 5 million.</li>
	<li><b>You have about 100,000 follicles on your <a href="event:scalp">scalp</a>, </b>which is the skin on your head.</li>
	<li><b>Hair grows very fast and male hair grows faster than female hair. </b>The only part of your body that grows faster is bone marrow, the soft stuff inside your bones.  The hair on your head grows about 6 inches a year. So, even though it's one of the fastest-growing things on your body, it takes a while to grow it really long. </li>
	<li><b>You lose about 50 to 100 hairs a day.</b> That's because the follicles don't all grow hair at the same time. Each scalp follicle grows hair for a few years, and then takes a break. When a follicle is on break, the hair in the follicle falls out. Since the follicles take breaks at different times and the other hairs keep growing, you probably don't notice when you lose hairs.</li>
	<li><b>Some follicles stop growing hair as you get older.</b> This happens more in some people than in others.  That's why some people get thinner hair when they get older or go bald. </li>
</ul>

That's what it looks and feels like.  Your hair might be:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Straight, wavy, curly or kinky</b></li>
	<li><b>Thick (a lot of it) or thin (not as much)</b></li>
	<li><b>Fine (each hair is skinny) or coarse (each hair is fat) </b></li> 
</ul>
<br>
The shape of your <a href="event:follicles">follicles</a> determines whether your hair is straight or curly. People with very curly hair have follicles that are oval-shaped and people with straight hair have round follicles.  The kind of hair you have is decided by the <a href="event:genes">genes</a> you get from your parents.<br><br>

Your hair may change its texture when you start becoming an adult. If it's straight now, it might become more curly. Or it might not.

Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/HairCare/About/Color/" target="_self">What Gives Hair Its Color</a>.<h3><a name="/SkinHairNails/HairCare/About/Color/"></a>What Gives Hair Its Color</h3>Like skin, hair can be different colors. It can be blond, brown, black or red…or something in between – like strawberry blond – which is kind of blond and red – or auburn – which is red and brown.<br><br>

Like your skin, its color comes from something called <a href="event:melanin">melanin</a>. Some people call it <a href="event:pigment">pigment</a>. Here is some interesting information about hair color:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>The more melanin your hair has, the darker its color. </b>How much melanin you have depends on your <a href="event:genes">genes</a>, which you get from your parents. </li>
	<li><b>If you are born with light hair, it often gets darker as you get older.</b> </li>
	<li><b>Your hair color is related to how thick or thin your hair is. </b> People with red hair have the thickest hair and people with blonde hair have the thinnest.  Brown and black hair are in the middle. That means if you compared a single red hair to a single blonde hair, you would be able to see that the red hair was fatter or bigger around than the blonde hair. But blondes have more hair than redheads. So it all kind of evens out.</li>
	<li><b>When you get much older, your hair will probably get gray or white.</b> That's because you make less melanin, so your hair starts losing its color, which makes it look gray.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Next: <a href="http://www.kidsskinhealth.org/kids/#/SkinHairNails/HairCare/Care/" target="_self">Hair Care</a>.<h2><a name="/SkinHairNails/HairCare/Care/"></a>Hair Care</h2>Hair may be dead, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't care for it. You should wash it regularly. Actually, what you really need to be sure to wash is your <a href="event:scalp">scalp</a>. The best way to get your hair clean is to:<br><br>
<subitems>

<b>1. Get it really wet.</b><br><br>
<b>2. Use a small amount of shampoo.</b> A squirt about the size of a quarter is enough.<br><br>
<b>3. Rub the shampoo into your scalp.</b> Don't scrub too hard.<br><br>
<b>4. Rinse really well, </b>until you don't see any more bubbles or suds on your head or going down the drain.<br><br>
<b>5. Gently dry your hair with a towel.</b><br><br>
<b>6. Comb it out carefully </b>with a wide-tooth comb, especially if it's curly. Don't yank or tug on it, because that can break the hair or pull it out.<br><br>
<b>7. Let your hair air dry whenever you can.</b> Hair dryers can be tough on hair. <br>
</subitems>
If your scalp is itchy, dry and flaky, it could be because you aren't rinsing all of the shampoo out. Or it could be because you have something called dandruff. If you have <a href="event:dandruff">dandruff</a>, when you scratch your head, the skin flakes off and lands on your clothes. It's really noticeable if you're wearing dark colors. You can use a special shampoo that your parents can buy at the store. There are many to choose from. Talk to your doctor or a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>) to help you decide on the best shampoo for you.
<br><br>
How often you wash your hair depends on what it's like and what you do during the day. If your hair gets oily quickly, it needs to be washed more often. Straight hair can get oily quickly. Very curly hair is not as oily and can be washed less often. If you have very curly, kinky or thick hair, it might be too dry and look frizzy. Using a conditioner after you wash your hair might help, but that doesn't make it healthier. Remember, hair is already dead, but conditioner can make it look better.
<br><br>
All kinds of things can damage hair and make it break off or get too dry. To protect your hair, be careful around: 
<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>The sun</b> (which is one reason why you should wear a hat when you go outside).</li>
	<li><b>Chemicals </b>(such as chlorine) in pools (so you should wash your hair after swimming in a pool).</li>
	<li><b>Products and treatments </b>that make hair curly or straight or change its color.</li>
	<li><b>Things you use to style your hair, </b>such as curling irons, flat irons and hair dryers (so don't use them too much, especially if your hair seems to be getting drier or breaks easily).</li>
</ul>
<br>
One of the common types of hair damage is split ends. Look really closely at the end of a hair, and you might notice that the end is split apart. Because hair is dead, though, you can't repair split ends. All you can do is cut them off.
<br><br>
If you're worried about your hair or scalp, ask your parents to take you to your doctor or a skin doctor, who also cares for hair.

About 50 to 100 of them fall off your head. That's normal and you probably don't notice because other hairs keep growing. But sometimes, people lose a lot more hair than that. Is your grandpa or dad bald or losing his hair? Maybe even your grandma has thin hair. It's pretty common. Half of all men have bald spots by the time they're 50. Some women do, too. There are some medicines that might help.<br><br>

Many people shave some of that hair away. For girls, that typically means under the arms and on the legs. For boys, that means on the face.<br><br>

Before you try shaving, it's a good idea to ask your parents to give you advice and show you how. It's easy to cut yourself if you're not careful. You can even get an <a href="event:infection">infection</a> from the cut. <br><br>

Here are some tips:<br>

<ul>
	<li><b>Wet the area you'll be shaving really well.</b>  This is the most important thing you can do. Shaving dry skin doesn't work very well, and it can scratch your skin and make it rough. That's why lots of people shave in the shower or bathtub.</li>
	<li><b>Use shaving lotion or gel.</b> This helps prevent you from cutting your skin.</li>
	<li><b>Don't press too hard with the razor.</b> This could shave some of your skin off. </li> 
	<li><b>Use a disposable razor </b>or one with a disposable blade. Be sure to replace the razor or blade often. It might sound strange, but it's easy to cut yourself when the blade is dull. </li>

In fact, you started growing nails before you were even born! Here are the different parts of your nails and how they grow:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>The <a href="event:matrix">Matrix</a>:</b> Each nail begins growing out of a little pocket under your skin. This is the <a href="event:root">root</a> of the nail, and it's called the matrix. The matrix constantly makes new <a href="event:cells">cells</a>. These new cells force the old ones to get packed together and pushed up through the skin. By the time the nail pokes out of the skin (where you can see it), those cells are dead. That's why it doesn't hurt to cut your nails. </li>
	<img src="images/healthy_fingernail.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>The <a href="event:cuticle">Cuticle</a>:</b> You might have heard about other parts of the nail, such as the cuticle. This is a tiny sliver of skin where your nail grows out of your finger. It protects the root or the matrix from <a href="event:germ">germs</a>. </li>
	<li><b>The <a href="event:lunula">Lunula</a>:</b> The small, whitish, half-moon shape that you sometime see at the bottom of your nails is called the lunula (pronounced loon-yoo-la). It's actually part of the matrix. You might be able to see it only on your thumbs, or maybe not at all. Don't worry if you can't see a lunula on any of your fingers. It's no big deal. It's there, just under your skin.</li>
</ul>
 <br>
Some interesting facts about nail growth are: <br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Fingernails grow very slowly,</b> and your toenails grow even more slowly.</li>
	<li><b>A fingernail will take half a year to grow back</b> if you lose one because of an injury. If you lose a toenail, it might take a year and a half to grow back! </li>
	<li><b>Fingernails grow faster</b> on your larger fingers and on your right hand if you're right-handed, and your left hand if you're left-handed. </li>
	<li><b>Fingernails also grow</b> faster during the day and in the summer.</li>

<h2>Do:</h2> 

<ul>
	<li><b>Keep them short and clean.</b> Use a good nail clipper or a small nail scissors to cut them every week or two. If you let your nails get too long, they're more likely to break and to get <a href="event:germ">germs</a> under them that can make you sick.</li>
	<li><b>Cut them in the shape of the tip of your finger,  </b>kind of straight across but a little round at the sides so they're strong.</li>
	<li><b>Cut your toenails straight across.</b> This will help stop an <a href="event:ingrown toenail">ingrown toenail</a>, which makes your nail grow into your skin and can hurt a lot. </li>
	<li><b>Use a fingernail file or <a href="event:emery board">emery board</a></b> (the thing that kind of looks like a popsicle stick but has rough surfaces) to get rid of the sharp edges so you don't snag them on things.</li>

	<li><b>Dry your hands really well</b> after washing them, or getting them wet.</li>

	<li><b>Eat foods that have <a href="event:protein">protein</a> and <a href="event:vitamin">vitamin</a> B7 (<a href="event:biotin">biotin</a>)</b>. That includes meat, fish, milk, nuts and eggs. They make your nails strong.</li>
	<li><b>Change your socks every day. </b> </li>
	<li><b>Wear flip flops in public showers and at the pool </b>to prevent <a href="event:infection">infections</a> caused by a <a href="event:fungus">fungus</a> that can get in your toenails.</li>
</ul><br>

<h2>Don't:</h2> 

<ul>
	<li><b>Bite your nails or pick at the skin around your nails. </b>It can cause an infection and it hurts, too!</li>
	<li><b>Pry or poke at things with your nails.</b> This can damage them.</li>
	<li><b>Cut or push back the <a href="event:cuticle">cuticles</a>,</b> the tiny sliver of skin where your nail grows out your finger. That can lead to infection.</li>
	<li><b>Use nail-polish remover more than twice a month.</b> It's really hard on your nails. </li>

A pedicure is for the feet. You guessed it, "pedi" means foot in Latin.
<br><br>
The treatment can be done at home or at a nail salon or spa. A lot of people go to nail salons or spas for manicures and pedicures. There even are some spas just for kids! At the end of the manicure or pedicure, the nails usually are painted with polish. 
<br><br>
Some kids also like to get fake nails. That's OK if you use the press-on ones made just for kids. It can be a fun activity, and the nails come off easily. But the professional kind of fake or artificial nails can give you a rash or even damage your nail. Not a good idea!

During a manicure and pedicure, the technician will:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Cut and shape your nails. </b></li>
	<li><b>Remove any dead skin</b> around them.  </li>
	<li><b>Give your feet and hands a mini-massage</b> by rubbing them and putting on a special lotion called a <a href="event:moisturizer">moisturizer</a>.  </li>
	<li><b>Soak your feet in water during a pedicure to soften the skin.</b> After your feet soak, the technician will rub the bottom of them with a flat stick that has a surface that feels like sandpaper. This makes the hard parts (calluses) softer. </li>
	<li><b>Let you pick out nail polish color.</b> The technician might apply a clear base coat, and then two coats of the color. You'll probably have to sit for a little while afterward to be sure the polish dries so it doesn't get smudged.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Nail polish won't hurt your nails. Sometimes it even protects your nails and helps keep them moist. <br><br>

If you use nail polish:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Don't use polish with nail hardeners</b> because they actually make the nails too hard, and they can break.</li> 
	<li><b>Put on a base coat of clear nail polish</b> when wearing dark nail polish. Dark nail polish can stain your nails if you wear it a lot. It doesn't hurt your nails, though, and it will fade. </li>
	<li><b>Don't use nail polish remover more than twice a month.</b> Nail polish remover is really hard on the nails. It dries nails out. When you use it, be sure to moisturize your nails afterward. Rub moisturizer into your nails, especially at the edges where your nail meets your skin.</li>
</ul>
<br>
By the way, you can give yourself a manicure and pedicure at home, too. But be very careful when cutting your nails so you don't cut your skin! It might be easier to have one of your parents do this for you.

If you go to a salon:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ask how they keep the instruments they use for <a href="event:manicure">manicures</a> and <a href="event:pedicure">pedicures</a> clean.</b> All of the tools and instruments should be disposable or cleaned each time they're used. </li>
	<li><b>Look around to see if the salon is neat and clean.</b> </li>
	<li><b>Make sure the technicians wash their hands</b> before each manicure or pedicure. Some nail technicians wear a new pair of disposable gloves each time they do a manicure or pedicure.</li>
</ul>
<br>
If you have a manicure or pedicure and a few days later you notice your nails, fingers or toes are sore, red or oozing <a href="event:pus">pus</a> (a yellow liquid), you should have the problem checked out. You could have an <a href="event:infection">infection</a>. Your parents should take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>) to get treatment.

<h2><a name="/SkinHairNails/NailsHealth/Biting/"></a>Nail Biting</h2>We all have habits. Nail biting is a common one. Lots of kids do it, and even some adults. But if you bite your nails, you really need to try to stop. Here's why:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>It can make the skin around your nails bleed and your fingers feel sore.</b> </li>
	<li><b>Your nails really look bad when you bite them.</b> If you do it long enough, they could look bad forever. </li>
	<li><b>You could get an <a href="event:infection">infection</a> in your fingers.</b> That's because when you bite your nails, you can create little open sores that let in <a href="event:germ">germs</a>. Nail biting can cause problems with your teeth, and even an infection in your gums. It's bad news.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The good news is fewer adults bite their nails than kids, which means as they get older, lots of people just stop doing it. In the meantime, try to pay more attention to when you bite your fingernails, and stop yourself when you are. If you have a hard time, you might want to ask your mom or dad to buy special stuff at the store to put on your nails. It makes them taste awful. It won't hurt you, but as soon as you start to bite, you'll get that awful taste, which will remind you to stop.

<h2><a name="/SkinHairNails/NailsHealth/Infections/"></a>Infections</h2>Sometimes <a href="event:germ">germs</a> can invade your nail or the skin underneath and cause an <a href="event:infection">infection</a>. The most common type of germ that causes nail infections is called a <a href="event:fungus">fungus</a>. <br><br>

Fungal infections:<br>
<ul>
	<img src="images/nail_infection.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Are more likely in toenails than fingernails.</b>  That's because a fungus is more likely to grow in warm and wet places, which might happen if you wear shoes or boots that make your feet hot and sweaty.</li>
	<li><b>Can happen if you walk barefoot at pools or in public showers.</b></li> 
	<li><b>Might make a nail turn white, green, yellow or black.</b> Sometimes it makes your nail thicker and causes it to pull away from your toe.</li>
</ul>
<br>
If you get an infection, your parents should take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). The skin doctor can give you medicine that will clear it up. Cream you can buy at the store usually doesn't work.<br><br>

The best thing to do is to keep your nails clean and dry to try to avoid infections in the first place.

Or has someone big and heavy ever stepped on your toes? When things like that happen, they can hurt both you and your nails.<br><br>

When a nail is injured, different things can happen:<br>
<ul>
	<img src="images/nail_injury.gif" align="right" height="140" width="150"><li><b>Bruises might form</b> underneath the nail that make it look black or purple.</li>	

<li><b>Reddish-brown lines</b> might appear in the nail, which means the <a href="event:blood vessels">blood vessels</a> – the little tubes that carry blood through your body – were damaged. </li><img src="images/nail_brown_lines1.gif" align="right" height="180" width="150">
	<li><b>White spots</b> might be noticeable as the nail grows.</li>
</ul>
<br>
These things might look really bad, but they are pretty normal.<br><br>

If you injure a nail:<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Use a cold <a href="event:compress">compress</a>.</b> Have your mom or dad make it for you. It sounds fancy, but it's just putting ice inside a cloth or wetting it with cold water and then placing the cloth on the nail to help the swelling go down. Don't put ice directly on the nail because it can damage the skin around the nail.</li>
	
<img src="images/nail_brown_lines2.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150"><li><b>Keep the nail elevated</b> or raised higher than your heart for a while.  </li>
	<li><b>Consider seeing a doctor if the nail is black or purple and really hurts.</b> It hurts because the bruise is caused by blood building up under the nail. The doctor can make a small hole in your nail to release the pressure.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img src="images/nail_white_spots.gif" align="right" height="200" width="150">In some cases, the nail gets hurt so bad it will fall off. It should grow back, but it can take a long time. <br><br>

If you have some of these problems and you don't remember injuring your nail, have your parents take you to a skin doctor (<a href="event:dermatologist">dermatologist</a>). A skin doctor takes care of nails and can help you find out what is wrong and see if other things like chemicals, a disease or <a href="event:infection">infection</a> might have hurt your nail.  <br><br>
