										</div>
<p>But it will be years before most of these hikes take a bite out of your -- or your company's -- wallet. <b>The law also has tax breaks</b> to help both individuals and small businesses pay for insurance.</p>


<p><B>1. A new 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services</B>  on services provided after June 30, 2010.</p>


<p><B>2. The new law gives small firms tax credits as incentives to provide coverage,</B> starting this tax year. Employers with 10 or fewer workers and average annual wages of less than $25,000 can receive a credit of up to 35% of their health premium costs each year through 2013. The credit is phased out for firms larger than that and disappears completely if a company has more than 25 employees or average annual wages of $50,000 or more. 

<p>Beginning in 2014, the system changes. The law requires each state to establish a health insurance exchange -- a marketplace where individuals, the self-employed and small businesses can buy health insurance coverage. The government-regulated exchanges would offer insurance policies with different levels of coverage and price tags. Small firms that sign up with one of the health exchanges to be created can receive a credit of up to 50% of their costs -- with the same phaseouts for average income and size as the earlier program. The credit disappears after 2015.</p>


<p>3. A requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s. Although this was originally required beginning with W-2s for 2011 ? those issued early in 2012 ? in October, a one-year delay was announced. Employers may voluntarily report the value of health benefits they provide on 2011 W-2s, but this will not be mandatory until the 2012 forms. The amount reported is not considered taxable income.</p>


<p>4. Elimination of a deduction employers now take for providing <B>Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage</B> to their retirees to the extent that the federal government subsidizes the coverage. This will not take effect until 2013.</p>


<p>5. Doubling the penalty for <B>nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts,</B> to 20%, beginning in 2011.</p>


<p>6. A limit on the amount that employees can contribute to <B>health care flexible spending accounts</B> to $2,500 a year, but the cap won?t take effect until 2013. This was previously left to the employer's discretion, with many firms choosing a limit of $4,000 to $5,000 or so</p>


<p>7. A ban on using funds from flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts for the cost of <B>over-the-counter medications</B>, starting in 2011.</p>


<p>8. Starting in 2013, <b>a 0.9% Medicare surtax</b> will apply to wages in excess of $200,000 for single taxpayers and over $250,000 for married couples. Also, <b>for the first time ever, a Medicare tax will apply to investment income of high earners.</b> The 3.8% levy will hit the lesser of (1) their unearned income or (2) the amount by which their adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000 or $250,000 threshold amounts. The new law defines unearned income as interest, dividends, capital gains, annuities, royalties, and rents. Tax-exempt interest won?t be included, nor will income from retirement accounts.</p>
.

<p>9. <B>A hike in the 7.5% floor on itemized deductions</B> for medical expenses to 10%, beginning in 2013. But taxpayers age 65 and over are exempt from the cutback through 2016.</p>


<p>10. <B>A new 40% excise tax, beginning in 2018, on high-cost health plans</B>, levied on the portion that exceeds $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. The provision is aimed mostly at gold-plated plans offered by employers, although it can affect individual policies</p>


<p>11. <B>A new tax on individuals who don't obtain adequate health coverage by 2014 -- this is often referred to as the individual mandate.</B> The tax is to be phased in over three years, starting at the greater of $95, or 1% of income, in 2014, and rising to the greater of $695, or 2.5% of gross income, in 2016. </p>


<p>12. Providing a refundable tax credit, once the individual mandate takes effect in 2014, <B>to help low-income folks purchase coverage</B>. To be eligible, a person's household income must be between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, generally around $11,000 to $44,000 for singles and $22,000 to $88,000 for families. The credit is a sliding scale, based on income.  Low-incomers get a credit for all costs.  Then, as income rises, the credit phases out.</p>


<p>13. <B>A nondeductible fee charged to businesses with 50 or more employees</B> if the firms fail to offer adequate coverage. The fee will equal $2,000 times the number of employees, though it won?t count the first 30 workers in that calculation.</p>

<p>Nothing is free, and the overall benefit of having people getting health care beforee needing critical care at emergency rooms should help limit costs.  My father spent all his savings, then reverse mortgaged his home to pay for uncovered medical expenses of my stepmother.  He lost everything and died in a nursing home because he didn't want to be a burden to me.  If I can spare that to others, I'm willing to pay higher taxes!</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>Addendum: the "Cadillac Tax" is not indexed to inflation, and even at present amounts, a typical working professional at a big company's plan already falls under this category. The corporate rank-and-file across America will suddenly cost their employers thousands more than they did before, UNLESS their coverage gets a significant downgrade. How do you think that will play out? Oh wait, even Obama and the CBO have said they expect that. Possible irony - while all our plans are cut, the plans that lower income people buy with our tax subsidies might, in fact, be BETTER than ours!</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>My friend lost her Medicaid coverage when one month in 2008 when she made a few dollars too much.  She was dropped by the state...less than 4 months later she suffered a massive heart attack...cost the state over $100,000 to medivac, quadruple by-pass, 2 weeks in the hospital and she was not able to work until the last few months....Would have been way cheaper to provide health insurance so she could have afforded the heart meds!  Another friend got pneumonia in an Asian country (don't remember was either Japan or S. Korea), spent a week in the hospital.  Cost: $ZERO.  Why can't we have what the rest of the First World provides its citizens?  Health care should not be controlled by BIG BUSINESS (health insurance companies, drug companies)!  It's shameful!</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>With the exception of one comment so far, the posts seem to be the typical "cry me a river" sob story.   They believe we're suppose to change our entire healthcare system based on antidotes.  Thus, the debate continues between rational libertarians/conservatives and emotional liberals/socialists.  The teardrops are always willing to make a "personal decision" that EVERYONE ELSE is OK with paying for a new government program.  The trial lawyers will still sue, and the number of doctors will continue to decline.  And so the Producers will continue to provide for the Parasites .... until the Hosts die.  Welcome to utopia where everyone is EQUALLY miserable and poor.  No one in the castle will care about your stories then, comrade.  </p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>i agree with DM. certainly there are stories that are painful. however, many people refuse to pay for health insurance, because they don't want to. they refuse to take personal responsibility. they prefer to spend their money elsewhere. certainly those who cannot afford it, need some type of help. new law caps HSA at $2500.00 per year. that simply means we will pay more out of pocket. why cap it? so we cannot take advantage of tax break. this bill will be a tremendous cost to the insured. no way out. </p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>Joe,
If you lived in an ideal world, you could pay the extra taxces to cover your family healthcare costs.  But, what you support is mandating every taxpayer pay for your family insurance; that is not liberty. </p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>Who benefits from this change?
?A ban on using funds from flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts for the cost of over-the-counter medications, starting in 2011.
If the government isn't going to allow me to use this money for over-the-counter medications, then the rules need to be changed to allow me to roll-over any leftover funds to the next fund year or refunded to me instead of going to the governments' coffers.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>I will be looking into dropping my company-provided insurance and getting on the govt insurance plan.  I figure I will be able to save myself several thousand dollars a year just for premiums.  Hey, if they're gonna stick the govt teat out there, I'm going to start sucking on it.  In fact, I may divorce my wife on paper and have her apply for food stamps and welfare.  She should be able to bring in more than her salary just by being a single mom.  Then she wouldnt have to work and I might be getting some of my tax dollars back.  Thanks Obama!  Now I dont have to worry about paying my mortgage!  :)</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>ET just to clarify the new bill doesn't limit contribution to a Health Savings Account(HSA) they limit contributions to a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) which is different and not as good as a HSA in my opinion.  A FSA limits are currently set by an employer and has to be used in year the contribution is made.

<p>joeS   Limiting health means you die.
Nothing in this bill helps what happened to you dad.  It means we can't afford healthcare.
The cost is not going to go down it is going away.
I want to see the look on your face when you have to pay $5000 on April 15 because your W-2 says your health insurance cost is $25000 so that is taxable income.
 the problem you or going to have is the same because the medical coverage will still be uncovered because the insurance will not be provided.  You'll have to pay for supplemental insurance plans to cover your healthcare.  YOur employer will not buy it for you anymore because there will be a 40% excise tax on the type of coverage that might have been available to you or your DAD.

<p>How old was your father, Joe?  Was he a Medicare beneficiary?  Under Obamacare, we will all be on Medicare and will not have access to quality medical services.  My heart bleeds as much as anyone's, but no matter how you judge the merits of this program, the simple fact is that it will bankrupt the country in a very short time.  And when that happens, "equalit"y will have a whole new meaning.  The sensible thing to do is for thinking Americans to strongly advocate a repeal of this bill, and replace it with something that makes sense.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>I was totally against this but I'm going to take advantage of the new "system." Can't beat 'em join 'em as they say.  I've already reduced my income by working fewer hours per week and my husband has done the same. This helps the small company we work for and keeps us below the income threshold that will take the big hit. We may even qualify for assistance in our health insurance purchase in 2014 if we continue to downsize our lifestyle (pay off our home, grow our own food, entertain at home, etc.) as we head towards retirement.

The wealthier friends we have are doing their own planning - moving their assets and business investments to other countries, planning to retire earlier or semi-retire to reduce their personal income, etc. Everyone has a strategy and if you plan well you can take advantage of it too. 

Small business will struggle the most and lose the most it seems. This is how it is in Europe it seems where having a small business is usually a one man/woman show as what we would call a "contractor." They can't afford to employ people because the costs and redtape is so challenging.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>"?Providing a refundable tax credit, once the individual mandate takes effect in 2014, to help low-income folks purchase coverage. To be eligible, a person?s household income must be between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, generally around $11,000 to $44,000 for singles and $22,000 to $88,000 for families." This is very misleading. Under the law, only people who buy insurance via exchanges (to be established by 2014) are eligible for this tax credit. If you buy insurance through your employer or through a program like Medicare or Medicaid, you are not eligible for the tax credit.

The problem with (supposedly) sparing others from this sacfice is that a. it is imposed, rather than willingly given, as in your case, and b. it won't work. As you can clearly see by reading the comments here, those who might have taken individual responsibility will now instead feed from the government teat. I promise you that you will see an avalanch of people in this group. Remember these words:"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always to be followed by dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years." -- Alexander Woodhouselee

<p>The problem with the plan is in the name.  Government run health care.  Individuals, qualified or otherwise, appointed by individuals, qualified or otherwise, appointed as a result of their political contacts, deciding what treatment you may have, deciding what drugs you will be permitted to receive and deciding how much your doctor of choice will be paid by the plan.  Government run.  Are you all nuts, can you think of anything the government does, (under the control of either party),  efficiently or properly?  How about the SEC, oh never mind, how about Medicare, oh never mind, how about Social Security.  There used to be what was called the "Social Security Trust Fund"  It was started the same way as Obamacare.  Collect the money necessary to fund the plan several years before the plan kicks in and put that money into a trust fund to pay the cost of the fund.  That worked until one day (not too long ago) the Government decided that because it did not have enough money to spend,  it would simply raid the Social Security Trust Fund and spend it.  There was more than enough money in the Trust Fund to fund Social Security and now there is nothing.  Now with the financial future of Social Security very much in  doubt, the Government ingores that fact and instead of taking the necessary steps to secure the future of Social Security enacts Obamacare.  Government run.  To those who support the plan,  will you feel the same when we have another George Bush Republician in the white house running the program?  To be sure, that day will come and you will have yourself to blame. </p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>Help me to understand, how this Health Care Bill helps the average American? The newly opposed taxes that will be charged for not having sufficient health care is ludicrous. If people can't afford the health-care now, how will they afford to pay the penalties?  So we need to hold Congress accountable for making this plan work. We need affordable rents, and more jobs, so people can afford to pay. The cost of health care for working people is too high, you pay a premium at work, the job pays a portion, and you pay a co-pay, then you still get a bill for 20% of what your bill is... Where is the money going and why we still have to pay????  If you are paying for these fees then no other charges should apply... WE the people need a reform that works.. Cut costs not continuely raise costs to drive people to homelessness, joblessness, and poverty.. Without the people their will be nothing left for the world..

Why is the govt. willing to give away free healthcare when many people who abuse and use our healthcare system refuse to to make the right decisions in their own life for care?  Why should I who work out, eat properly, and only go the doctor for annual check ups have to pay for someone who is obese, diabetic (obese), high blood pressure, CHF, etc.. and for those who continue to have children they cannot afford?  Why should I have to pay for someone who wants to keep they elderly parent on life support despite the fact that they have no quality of life left?  Why should I have to pay for medications for people with so many health ailments, that if they had followed simple instructions in life they would be healthy?  Medicaid, medicare, and welfare should be eleminated.  People need to be more responsible for themselves and thier children. Obama is a disgrace and I fault the republicans as well for this fiasco.

It is NOT a privilege to have health insurance but it is a right. Lose your job, tough, you lose your health and maybe your life. It's absolutely absurd that those who, through no fault of their own, are now unemployed (bad enough) but also after COBRA expires will be walking around like the living dead (i.e. no health insurance). Thank goodness I still have my good job (at least for now that is) . AM I THE ONLY EVERY DAY JOE THAT SEES THIS??? WE NEED A PUBLIC OPTION NOW TO COMPETE WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES!!! Those who lose coverage will not only get sicker but that, in turn, will increase costs for those who are lucky enough to have a j-o-b/insurance. Don't tell me about the freakin' 'exchanges'.

<p>Bottom line in all this argument of insurance company profitting from medical care is that your wonderful, benevolent government mandated that insurance company's cover all this mess...it started out as "hospitalization" insurance, so that you could get major healtcare covered without going bankrupt.  Then it slowly worked it's way into an annual checkup, when those costs should be borne on the individual.  It isn't about medicine or better health care or making everybody healthy, this whole argument is about government control of our lives.  They are on that path, like nazi's, and you're about to lose a Liberty you never even realized you had.  Self Reliance is a dirty word to a liberal/socialist/communist.

What I am saying is it should choice should be mine and mine alone and the consequences are mine as well on what to spend my income on. Now with the "New Health-care Program" I will be forced to pay over and over and over taxes on items I can barely afford now!! How does that make any-ones life better??? I am sure though that the next new "Benefit" will of course be free housing for those of us who will no longer be able to even keep the lights on at night and will be sent to Govt. run housing camps. Oh and guess who will have to pay for that as well..... anyone who is left standing with their hand out to receive a paycheck for 30% less after taxes and twice the work. Americans.....WE ARE IN TROUBLE HERE!!!! Please lool past today and consider what tomorrow will look like.   </p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>The federal government has delegated power to tax income and certain forms of economic activity but there is no delegated power for them to tax economic inactivity  not buying something.

If they call it a "tax" they lack a delegated power to levy it for the CAUSE of not having insurance: the reason for a tax is not and cannot be immaterial to the methodology collecting it.

Additionally, the federal government has no delegated power to criminalize not participating in a commercial activity for persons among the several States (it does have some power to enact Rules and Regulations in D.C, the Territories or as regards the USE of a federal accommodation).

So if they dance around the tax issue and call it a "fine" they are imposing it in many cases where they've no power to write Rules and Regulations.

Either way, #11 is flatly unconstitutional.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>Ms. Pryde failed to include on #10 that the excise tax will be paid by the COVERAGE PROVIDER.  There is an email circulating that this tax will be imposed on the employee, however, in Title IX, on page 5, line 19 under "(c) Liability to Pay Tax", it says (beginning on line 20):  "(1) In General - Each coverage provider shall pay the tax imposed by subsection 9a) on its applicable share of the excess benefit with respect to an employee for any taxable period."

<p>The taxes discussed here are only the beginning. The middle class will be hit because costs are going to be massively higher partially because the uninsured are not going to buy insurance until they are sick. You are very unaware to think this is a good thing...it is going to bankrupt America and the younger generation will be forced into a meager future because of this bill. JoeS, who is willing to pay higher taxes will get his wish. Tax rates for everyone are going massively higher unless it gets repealed and replaced with a more thoughtful bill that actually controls costs vs spreading coverage. By the way, many doctors are going to refuse Medicare patients...try finding a doctor that thinks this is a good idea.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>I have been working for 39 years.  Just a few weeks ago my employer told me that if I didn't start working part time they would lay me off.  Being a productive member of society, I chose to start working part time and maybe when the economy got better they will ask me to work full time again.  My problem is that in 18 months I will not have affordable insurance.  I have gotten some quotes of 1200.00 - 1500.00 per month because I have had asthma since childhood.  I have never been hospitalized because of it.  Even the cobra insurance being offered to me is 757.00 per month.  I can't afford all this working part time.  I will look for another job full time, but I need help.  I am not finding help though.  I went to the job and family services website and looked into applying for assistance.  It appeared to me that there was no help there.  If I was an illegal immigrant I could get help.  But a productive member of society that just needs temporary help with health care costs is screwed.  Where do I turn?  What is the definition of affordable healthcare?  How much is that?  I know I am not going to be able to maintain my present situation for long.  I need help!!!</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>Hello, Mark Willen, Senior Editor for the Kiplinger Letter here. The new health law requires that employers start reporting the value of the health benefits you get on your W-2 form for 2011 (the one youll receive in January 2012). But the benefits will not be added to your taxable income, and youll pay no additional tax. The requirement is a hassle and expense for employers, but its aim, according to sponsors, is to help. The idea is that if workers know how much their employers actually pay for health benefits, theyll work harder to keep costs down and be more understanding when pay raises are modest. Some folks fear that even if the law doesnt require taxing benefits now, it will eventually. To them, reporting the value of the benefit is just a first step that will lead inevitably to taxation. Perhaps. Taxing benefits is certainly a possibility down the road. In fact, Sen. John McCain of Arizona proposed exactly that when he was the GOP presidential candidate in 2008. But claiming that the tax is a done deal is simply false. For now, at least, that health benefit line youll see on your W-2 is strictly informational. Read more about how our reporting got twisted in an email campaign in my column here: http://www.kiplinger.com/columns/washington/archives/no-health-benefits-wont-be-taxed-.html</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>One aspect that many have missed is that many of the things that diabetics need to survive are actually over the counter items. Not just test strips (which cost about $1 EACH, can be used once, and you need between 3 and 6 PER DAY of) but the needles that are used to get the sample for the test, the syringes, and even the INSULIN are all over the counter items.

If you shop around for price (my insulin costs $25 at WalMart, $67 at CVS) and limit testing to 3 times per day, you can limit the cost of over the counter items for diabetes to around $5 PER DAY. Some medical plans will pay for insulin if you have a prescription, so that would cut your costs to $4 per day. Even so, paying another $4 to $5 per day out of their pocket instead of from (pre-tax) HSA funds will be a big hit for many diabetics.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

All I read above is that our tax situation IMPROVES unless we are a big corporation (Great; set 'em straight and level the playing field) or affluent ($200K annual earnings or more, $250K for couples). 

As for the medicare/medicaid comment below, say what? This is a different program that handles your healthcare via existing private means (in other words, your same darn plan!!). For those of us who can't afford coverage at all, is it really so bad to have to deal with some bureaucracy, or is it preferable to just let them all die in the streets?

<p>I cannot afford the over $500 a month to pay for employer-offered insurance, so I resent it when people who have the money to buy into these plans say that other people 'choose not to' and waste money on other items. What should I sacrifice to pay for that health insurance? My rent money? Perhaps the electric and phone? Cable costs $30 a month and cutting it will in no way pay for the health insurance. Maybe we could quit eating, but our groceries per month do not equal that amount either... sometimes there is no win. I am not at all a fan of the new healthcare system, but I am also not a fan of being lumped in as people who 'have insurance available and refuse it' for petty reasons. There are plenty of us who refuse it just so we can keep a roof over our heads and feed our children. At this rate I would rather continue as we are - be seen by a doctor when we need to (that 'need' includes vaccinations/yearly visit for children) and pay in monthly incriments with smaller amounts of honestly-earned money - than to fork out an amount almost equal to rent for insurance that will still leave us doing what? Making monthly payments to the doctor. </p></div><div class="a-comment">

And almost a quarter of the cost is spent in administrative expenses!  The rest is prescription drug cost and the rise in the number of for profit hospitals.

Too many overweight people with the diseases that come with that condition alone drain the Medicare system and other health care plans.  These long term maintenance issues cost the rest of us who take care of ourselves PROACTIVELY thousands of dollars in premiums and benefit reductions each year.  Shape up, America!  No pun intended.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>The ghastly truth is that these are but very few of the taxes hidden within the bill-that-did-not-pass.  Rather the resolution to agree to changes in a bill-that-was-signed-but-not-passed did in fact pass.  The best defense in this case is to do the Civil Disobedient thing and not participate, not to pay, not to cave, not to release records, not to play and in fact, give them back the ball and teach them all how to play. 
Enough nonsense.  Bring back the tokens (1837)  "Millions for Defense, Not one Cent for Tribute (Welfare)".

Now the Federal Gav't wants to take another 40% of my income from my health benefit?  When I retired my income became "fixed".  I get no increases in benefits or income.  Now the Feds want to take another 40% because 15% of the population doesn't have health care?  I worked 40 years to get my retirement and those that don't work get my money?

Here are 13 changes in the massive overhaul that could impact your tax bill, for better or worse.
By Joan Pryde, Senior Tax Editor, the Kiplinger letters

3. A requirement that businesses include the value of the health care benefits they provide to employees on W-2s, beginning with W-2s for 2011. The amount reported is not considered taxable income. This is from the health reform law and I when I read it at thomas.gov I interrupted it that will be considered taxable income Comments please.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>JoeS is thinking emotionally; go ahead and pay higher taxes.  Just don't ask me to pay for you, your dad or anyone else.   What evidence is there that a Federal forced health insurance will prevent you or anyone else from loosing their life savings to pay for health care?  Our current government only knows increased costs & taxes.   if you have savings or a house, that will be included next time the "health insurance law is revised".

<h1>Posted by: J at 07/31/2010 04:12:31 PM</h1>
<p>Molly, one of the first points which should be considered when trying to make an intelligent argument is to properly use the language of choice.

Hope is not a plan, it is an emotion.  People in this country made an emotional decision between two poor candidates.  With an approval rating of 44% is is not a stretch to write that Mr. Obama is generally considered to be doing a poor job.  

Healthcare reform is/was needed, but not what was done.  The fact is this - no matter what  your moral, ethical, emotional, or philosophical beliefs are with regard to "universal" health care coverage -- THIS COUNTRY CAN NOT AFFORD IT.  Or more specifically stated - we can not afford it at the present standard.  Breast cancer survival rates are nearly 10% lower in England (our closest developed country comparison) than here.  Age and life expectancy will be considered prior to treatment of complex and expensive diseases.  You will not see physicians as a rule, you will see PAs and nurses.  These are not emotional statements they are facts that will happen -- there are not enough medical schools in this country to create the necessary number of physicians for the new increased demand... there are not enough now.  

Sadly, the main diseases in this country are highly preventable and largely linked to obesity and lethargy.  These diseases are not the major world killers such as bacteria and parasites which are comparatively tremendously less to treat and diagnose.

This systems will only create more of a have and have not scenario.  Not everyone in this country gets to be treated at the Mass General (Harvard Med School Hospital) when we fall ill like the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, for example.  This system will also not be utilized by our feudal leaders in Washington.

Finally, please, please, please stop blaming a President who has not been in office for 2 years.  This is unprecedented by any other previous administration.  The benefit of being a President is that you get all of the credit when things go well (deserving or not); the drawback is that you get all of the blame when things go wrong (deserving or not).  Deal with it.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

Don't you know that this section of the health destruction bill was written by Maxine Waters to stick it to the white folks? Who will be paying the additional 10%? None of my black friends or my Mexican neighbors use that service. Besides John is very busy fighting evil and doesn't have time to be laying around in a tanning bed, he gets the spray on tan and is not subject to the tax.

<p>Wow Molly, do you have an original, constructive thought or are you only able to repeat talking points (irrational yelling is too funny)?  Basic economics and factual data disproves just about every point you are shrieking about.  More tax dollars are collected when more people are working, people in the higher tax brackets do not owe anyone anything and currently pay a disproportionate amount of the tax dollars collected.  Point of note is that the democrats have controlled congress since 2006, two years prior to Obamas election.  So those evil greedy Republicans were joined by evil, greedy, power hungry Democrats (Maxine Waters, Charlie Rangal, William Jefferson et al)  

Good for you that you are now off welfare, a government program which is paid for by working people, Democrat and Republican.  Are the issues with both parties, yes.  To think otherwise is naive.   But for government from either party kicking the can with stimulus and cash for clunkers merely hides or defers the inevitable.   Case in point would be the Cash for Clunkers program which cost everyone the equivalent of an additional $24,000 per auto sold.  (Great ROI there hmm?)  Finally, and sadly your rant seems to show you as the only racist here...funny that.

JUST A MATTER OF TIME!  I wouldn't consider the following to be YEARS from now!
A new 40% excise tax, beginning in 2018, on high-cost health plans, levied on the portion that exceeds $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. The provision is aimed mostly at gold-plated plans offered by employers, although it can affect individual policies

<p>Here's one that Kiplinger missed. Under the final bill passed by both houses HR3590 SEC 9001 here is what it says:
If you are self only or other than self only, you will pay an Excise Tax of 40% of your Health Care employer paid benefit of $8,500 or $23,000 respectively. 
What this means is that your tax bill will go up as the following example: 
Employer paid amount is 10,500 - 8,500 = 2,000 * 40% = $800.00.
Just remember that the Democrats exempted the Unions from this.</p></div><div class="a-comment">

<p>JD wrote this on 3/24/10: " 
Addendum: the "Cadillac Tax" is not indexed to inflation, and even at present amounts, a typical working professional at a big company's plan already falls under this category. The corporate rank-and-file across America will suddenly cost their employers thousands more than they did before, UNLESS their coverage gets a significant downgrade. How do you think that will play out? Oh wait, even Obama and the CBO have said they expect that. Possible irony - while all our plans are cut, the plans that lower income people buy with our tax subsidies might, in fact, be BETTER than ours! "

I, too, realized this at the time. What truly astounded me is that this is JD's is the first comment, other than my own, that I've since come across that picked up on this. Not a single one of the many articles by the so-called experts (and media trolls) mentioned it. I have a theory why this is so: THIS RESULT, seemingly untoward, IS THE ACTUAL PURPOSE of the Obama Plan. Why so? Because the pain that it would/will cause for tens of millions of people will, the Libtards hope, tilt the balance of public opinion in favor of an eventual, universal National Health Insurance Plan. I.E., government pays, one-size-fits-all. 

There was always a chance for a truly effective health care reform which wouldn't leave the poor (or just the working poor) behind--one very much like Germany's private-insurer plan, which constrains the unconscionable profits of the pill pushers, the medical equipment makers, the medical specialists, the lawyers, et al. NONE of the special interests who routinely BRIBE our elected officials wanted that. NOR did the doctrinaire socialists, who prefer something like England's or Canada's systems. ALL of the ideologues and ALL of the special interests, on both sides of every issue, are invested in the current mess continuing, whether in its current state of slowly reducing us to third world status, or pushing the reset button for a pinker world.</p></div><div class="a-comment">
<h1>Posted by: Cathy at 09/30/2010 07:15:18 AM</h1>
<p>Those of you who think this is a wonderful plan should just take a look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Post Office, and all the other programs run by the government.  They are all heading toward insolvency if they aren't already there.  As a Medicare recipient, they already impose a means test.  If your income is over a certain level, you pay much higher premiums.  As someone enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, Obama and AARP have worked together to cut these programs because they offer more than your regular Medicare. These plans are like regular insurance instead of the welfare-type Medicare.  Like others posted here, we have cut our income so that we don't have to pay the higher premiums.  Unfortunately, seniors will bear the brunt of cutbacks in care as the government will take $500 billion out of the program with millions of baby-boomers entering into it.  If they don't increase the payment to doctors, many of them will refuse to see Medicare patients, and this is happening already.  This socialistic program will not work.  Great Britain is already revamping their program by firing thousands of bureaucrats and letting the doctors work directly with the patients to decide their care.  Canada is creating more private health care, and in both cases, they can no longer afford the cost.  This is what will happen in the US unless we repeal this monstrosity and replace it with a more common-sense approach.  Let people be responsible for their own health care and receive tax credits for it.  We don't need to hire 16,000 new IRA agents at billions of dollars and create over 100 new government agencies to make the rules governing your health care.  My hope is that if the Republicans take the House in Nov. they will defund this program until we get a new president in 2012 and it is repealed, unless the courts throw it out before.  Just remember, nothing in life is free and someone pays the bills.  </p></div><div class="a-comment">
