&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decades of failed attempts by a string of Democratic presidents and a year of bitter partisan combat, President Obama signed legislation on March 23, 2010, to overhaul the nation&#8217;s health care system and guarantee access to medical insurance for tens of millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act seeks to extend insurance to more than 30 million people, primarily by expanding Medicaid and providing federal subsidies to help lower- and middle-income Americans buy private coverage. It will create insurance exchanges for those buying individual policies and prohibit insurers from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions. To reduce the soaring cost of Medicare, it creates a panel of experts to limit government reimbursement to only those treatments shown to be effective, and creates incentives for providers to &#8220;bundle&#8217;' services rather than charge by individual procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law will cost the government about $938 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congressional_budget_office/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;Congressional Budget Office&lt;/a&gt;, which has also estimated that it will reduce the federal deficit by $138 billion over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law was the largest single legislative achievement of Mr. Obama&#8217;s first two years in office, and the most controversial. Not a single Republican voted for the final version, and Republicans across the country campaigned on a promise to repeal the bill. In January 2011, shortly after they took control of the House, Republicans voted 245 to 189 in favor of repeal, in what both sides agreed was largely a symbolic act, given Democratic control of the Senate and White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court Largely Upholds the Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The case centered on the question of whether Congress has the constitutional power to require people to purchase health insurance or face a penalty through the so-called individual mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the Supreme Court &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html?hp&gt;largely let stand the health care reform law stand.&lt;/a&gt; The high court&#8217;s &lt;a href=http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf&gt;5 to 4 decision&lt;/a&gt; was a striking victory for the president and Congressional Democrats, with a majority, including the conservative chief justice,&lt;a title=John G. Roberts Jr. href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/john_g_jr_roberts/index.html&gt; John G. Roberts Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, affirming the central legislative pillar of Mr. Obama&#8217;s term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s decision did significantly restrict one major portion of the law: the expansion of &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;, the government health-insurance program for low-income and sick people. The ruling gives states some flexibility not to expand their Medicaid programs, without paying the same financial penalties that the law called for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the court&#8217;s decision, the debate over health care remains far from over, with Republicans vowing to carry on their fight against the law. The Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has promised to undo it if elected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle Continues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11, less than two weeks after the Supreme Court decision, &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/health/policy/house-votes-again-to-repeal-health-law.html?hp&gt;the House passed a bill to repeal President Obama&#8217;s health care&lt;/a&gt; law. The bill was approved by a vote of 244 to 185, with five Democrats supporting repeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has no chance of approval in the Senate and would face a veto from Mr. Obama if it ever got to him. But the House debate exposed the depth of passion over efforts to remake the health care system and suggested that the fight would continue next year, regardless of who wins the November elections for president and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican governors and state legislators also began to plan a new approach that could have the effect of undercutting large parts of the law, which relies heavily on state governments for implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaning on the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling, the governors of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina said they would reject the law&#8217;s proposal to expand Medicaid, and others said they were leaning toward rejecting it.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of July, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on Medicaid &#8212; which essentially made its expansion optional for states &#8212; would probably &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/health/policy/3-million-more-may-lack-insurance-due-to-ruling-study-says.html?hp&gt;mean that 3 million fewer people would be insured under the law. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget office predicted that six million fewer people will be insured by Medicaid. But half of them, it said, will probably gain private insurance coverage through health insurance exchanges to be established in all states. Even though the law calls for the government to spend more per person on subsidies for insurance bought through exchanges than on Medicaid, the changes would reduce the law&#8217;s cost by about 7 percent, or $84 billion between 2012 and 2022, the budget office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Issue: Insurance Exchanges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=Liking It or Not, States Prepare for Health Law href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/us/like-it-or-not-states-prepare-for-health-law.html&gt;The law requires all states to have exchanges&lt;/a&gt;, which are essentially online marketplaces where small businesses and individuals can shop for private health plans,?in place by January 2014, when a requirement takes effect for most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. People with incomes between 133 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level can get federal tax subsidies through exchanges to make the price of coverage more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all states must have plans for the exchanges ready by Nov. 16, 2012, or leave it to the federal government to run the exchanges for them. That is just 10 days after Election Day, which is likely to decide the future of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=showhidetxt&gt;&lt;a id=more title=More href=javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');&gt;Read More...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=moretxt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late September 2012, only 13 states and the District of Columbia had formally committed to running their own exchanges. All of them but Rhode Island, whose governor, Lincoln Chafee, is an independent, are led by Democrats. The Republican governors in six states &#8212; Alaska, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, South Carolina and Texas &#8212; said they would not create state-run exchanges, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. So did New Hampshire, where Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, faced opposition from the Republican-controlled legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the remaining states, 22 of them run by Republicans, were exploring their options. At least four of them &#8212; Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada and New Mexico &#8212; had done enough planning to meet the November deadline should they decide to run their own exchanges, according to officials. &lt;a href=http://exchange.nv.gov/&gt;Nevada had already created its exchange&lt;/a&gt;, appointed its board and hired its executive director. Most Republican governors are waiting for the outcome of the presidential race before making a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many states run by Republicans say they want to be prepared in case the law survives. (Even if Mr. Romney wins, repealing the law will require Congressional approval, which will be difficult if Democrats retain control of the Senate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans who support state-run exchanges say they are embracing a fundamental conservative belief: that states should make their own decisions rather than cede control to the federal government. But groups that oppose the law have sent emissaries around the country to argue that deferring to the federal government is a shrewder move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Republicans in state legislatures do not need convincing: they are against state-run exchanges. That could make the challenge of creating them tough even if the framework is in place by November, because most states need legislative approval to establish them. Another option is a &#8220;partnership&#8221; exchange, one that is created by the federal government but that the state would have a role in operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democrats&#8217; desire for universal access to health insurance runs deep. President Franklin D. Roosevelt hoped to include some kind of national health insurance program in Social Security in 1935. President Harry S. Truman proposed a national health care program with an insurance fund into which everyone would pay. Since then, every Democratic president and several Republican presidents have wanted to provide affordable coverage to more Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Bill Clinton offered the most ambitious proposal and suffered the most spectacular failure. Working for 10 months behind closed doors, Clinton aides wrote a 240,000-word bill. Scores of lobbyists picked it apart. Congressional Democrats took potshots at it. And Republicans used the specter of government-run health care to help them take control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant differences between 1993-94 and 2009-10 is that employers and business groups, alarmed at the soaring cost of health care, took a seat at the negotiating table. Insurance companies, which helped defeat the Clinton plan, began 2009 by saying they accept the need for change and want a seat at the table. As the bills developed, however, they became strong opponents of some Democratic proposals, especially one to create a government-run insurance plan as an alternative to their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his budget for 2010, Mr. Obama gave an indication of the scope of his ambitions on health care reform when he asked Congress to set aside more than $600 billion as a down payment on efforts to remake the health care system over the next 10 years. But after sending Congress his budget plan, Mr. Obama&#8217;s White House, displaying a surprisingly light touch, encouraged Democrats in Congress to make the hard decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of March 2009, the chairmen of five Congressional committees had reached a consensus on the main ingredients of legislation, and insurance industry representatives had made some major concessions. The chairmen, all Democrats, agreed that everyone must carry insurance and that employers should be required to help pay for it. They also agreed that the government should offer a public health insurance plan as an alternative to private insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate Democratic Bills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats worked on three separate paths to develop legislation in the summer of 2009. In June, &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/health/policy/15health.html&gt;House Democratic leaders introduced their bill&lt;/a&gt;, which in addition to a public plan included efforts to slow the pace of Medicare spending, a tax on high-income people and penalties for businesses that do not insure their workers. After a revolt by a conservative group of &#8220;Blue Dog&#8217;' Democrats that led to more exemptions for businesses, the plan was adopted by three committees without Republican support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee worked on a bill with a public insurance plan, while the Senate Finance Committee, led by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, worked on a bill that sought to avoid one, which Mr. Baucus thought was necessary to gain bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, the Senate &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/us/politics/16health.html&gt;health committee passed its bill on a party-line vote of 13 to 10&lt;/a&gt;, with all Republicans opposing the package. Both Republicans and Democrats acknowledged that the health committee bill was just part of what would eventually be a single Senate measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle for Public Opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Congressional recess in August 2009, the White House appeared to lose control of the public debate over health care reform to a wave of conservative protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Party officials acknowledged that the growing intensity of the opposition to the president&#8217;s health care plans &#8212; plans likened on talk radio to something out of Hitler&#8217;s Germany, lampooned by protesters at Congressional town-hall-style meetings and vilified in television commercials &#8212; had caught them off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Mr. Obama confronted a critical Congress and a skeptical nation, decrying the &#8220;scare tactics&#8221; of his opponents and presenting his most forceful case yet for a sweeping health care overhaul that has eluded Washington for generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Obama said it was not true that the Democrats were proposing to provide health coverage to illegal immigrants, Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina yelled back, &#8220;You lie!&#8221; Mr. Wilson apologized but his outburst led to a six-day national debate on civility and decorum, and the House formally rebuked him on Sept. 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president&#8217;s speech appeared to restore momentum to the reform effort, at least for the moment, according to polls that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Baucus Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Senator Baucus introduced his long-awaited plan in the fall of 2009, the bill closely resembled what Mr. Obama said he wanted, except that it did not include a new government insurance plan to compete with private insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other bills, the Baucus plan would impose a new excise tax on insurance companies that sell high-end policies. The bill would not require employers to offer coverage. But employers with more than 50 workers would have to reimburse the government for some or all of the cost of subsidies provided to employees who buy insurance on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill got a significant boost when the Congressional Budget Office announced that despite its price tag, it would reduce the federal deficit by slowing the rate of health-care spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2009, the committee voted to approve the legislation. The vote was 14 to 9, with all Republicans opposed except for Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. Two weeks later, Ms. Snowe&#8217;s support was lost, when Mr. Reid, the majority leader, announced he would include a public option in the legislation he took to the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The House Bill Passes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Speaker Pelosi put the House bill to a vote, she had to broker a series of compromises that ultimately brought along just enough support from conservative Democrats to win passage. The biggest changes concerned the public option plan, which would have to negotiate rates just as private insurers do, rather than offering a rate set slightly above what Medicare pays; the plan would also confront strict controls on abortion. After heavy lobbying by Catholic bishops, the measure was amended to tighten restrictions on abortion coverage in subsidized plans bought through the insurance exchanges, to insure that no federal money was used to pay for an abortion. Both changes angered Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s base of liberal Democrats, but they chose to support the bill nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democrats said the House measure &#8212; paid for through new fees and taxes, along with cuts in Medicare &#8212; would extend coverage to 36 million people now without insurance while creating a government health insurance program. It would end insurance company practices like not covering pre-existing conditions or dropping people when they become ill. And despite its price tag, they pointed to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that said it would reduce the deficit over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of potential difficulties ahead, some centrist Democrats said they voted for the legislation so they could seek improvements in it in a conference with the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Senate&#8217;s Merged Bill &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By early November 2009, the broad outlines of the bill Senator Reid would introduce on the Senate floor were clear &#8212; it would include the public option that was part of the health committee&#8217;s bill, but with an &#8220;opt out&#8217;' provision for states, and many of the taxes and fees written in to the Finance Committee&#8217;s version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though broadly similar to the House bill, Mr. Reid&#8217;s proposal differed in important ways. It would, for example, increase the Medicare payroll tax on high-income people and impose a new excise tax on high-cost &#8220;Cadillac health plans&#8221; offered by employers to their employees. Mr. Reid&#8217;s bill would not go as far as the House bill in limiting access to abortion. And while he would require most Americans to obtain health insurance, he would impose less stringent penalties on people who did not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official cost analysis released by the nonpartisan &lt;a title=More articles about Congressional Budget Office, U.S. href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congressional_budget_office/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;Congressional Budget Office&lt;/a&gt; showed that Mr. Reid&#8217;s bill came in under the $900 billion goal suggested by Mr. Obama. But 24 million people would still be uninsured in 2019, the budget office said. About one-third of them would be illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would reduce deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and cover 36 million people, but still leave 18 million uninsured in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passage in the Senate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As debate began, Mr. Reid began searching for changes that could pull together the 60 votes that would be needed to avoid a Republican filibuster. The Democratic caucus contains 60 members, including two independents, but one of those independents, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said he would block a vote on any bill containing a public option. To win his vote, it was dropped, as was a compromise proposal to expand Medicare to allow people aged 55 to 64 to buy in to the plan &#8212; both moves that angered the Senate&#8217;s liberals, who pointed out that Mr. Lieberman had spoken in favor of the Medicare expansion three months before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last? Democrat to come on board was Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who won a series of changes: a provision to strip the insurance industry of its anti-trust exemption was dropped; language was added to allow states to decide to block plans covering abortion from their insurance exchanges; and the bill now provides Nebraska with additional Medicaid funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans vowed to use every parliamentary device at their disposal to slow the measure, which they said was being rammed through the Senate in an unseemly rush. But with Mr. Nelson on board, Mr. Reid&#8217;s bill survived the first serious procedural hurdle by reaching the 60 vote mark needed to fend off a filibuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the roll for the final vote was called at 7:05 a.m. on Dec. 24, 2009, it was a solemn moment. Senators called out &#8220;aye&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; Senator Robert C. Byrd, the 92-year-old Democrat from West Virginia, deviated slightly from the protocol. &#8220;This is for my friend Ted Kennedy,&#8221; Mr. Byrd said. &#8220;Aye!&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60-to-39 party-line vote came on the 25th straight day of debate on the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Upset and a Scramble &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But less than a month later, the victory of Scott Brown, a previously little known Republican state senator, in the Massachusetts special election to fill Mr. Kennedy&#8217;s seat, upset all calculations and left Democrats scrambling for approaches that might allow them to pass some version of the bill.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widely discussed approach called for the House to approve the Senate bill &#8212; thereby avoiding a filibuster if the Senate needed to vote on a compromise bill. That vote would be preceded by the passing of a separate bill containing the changes both houses could agree to. Democratic leaders believed that most of those could be put into a so-called budget reconciliation bill, which under Senate rules cannot be filibustered. But House Democrats were reluctant to move until the Senate moved first, and several conservative Democrats said they opposed using reconciliation. In mid-January 2010, Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi signalled that they did not expect quick action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his State of the Union address to Congress on Jan. 27, 2010, Mr. Obama called on Congress to finish the job. He appealed once more for Republicans to put forward ideas that could lead to a bipartisan approach. He added, &#8220;Do not walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let&#8217;s find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he did not lay out his preferences for the bill&#8217;s final form or lay out a means of passage. Almost two weeks later, in an interview during the Super Bowl&#8217;s pre-game show, Mr. Obama announced a bipartisan, half-day summit at the White House,?a high-profile gambit that would allow Americans to watch as Democrats and Republicans tried to break their political impasse. The plan would put Republicans on the spot to offer their own ideas on health care and show whether both sides were willing to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Health Ideas &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans never offered a unified health care bill, but the party&#8217;s Congressional leaders sketched out a fairly well-developed set of ideas intended to make health insurance more widely available and affordable, by emphasizing tax incentives and state innovations, with no new federal mandates and only a modest expansion of the federal safety net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republicans rely more on the market and less on government. They would not require employers to provide insurance. They opposed the Democrats&#8217; call for a big expansion of Medicaid, which Republicans said would burden states with huge long-term liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Congressional Budget Office has not analyzed all the Republican proposals, it is clear that they would not provide coverage to anything like the number of people &#8212; more than 30 million &#8212; who would gain insurance under the Democrats&#8217; proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Republicans say they can make incremental progress without the economic costs they contend the Democratic plans pose to the nation. As one way to encourage competition and drive down costs, Republican members of Congress want to make it easier for insurance companies to sell their policies across state lines, an idea included in a limited form in the Democratic bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Health Care Summit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 25, 2010, Congressional Democrats and Republicans joined Mr. Obama at Blair House, across the street from the White House, for an extraordinary seven-hour televised debate on the intricacies of heath care reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats tried to make the case that the two parties were closer than they thought, with the implication that their bill was centrist and would be acceptable to mainstream voters. Republicans countered that the gap was vast, that the bill was out of touch with what the country wanted and that Mr. Obama should throw it out and start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans said there was no way they would vote for Mr. Obama&#8217;s bill, and Democrats were talking openly about pushing it through Congress on a simple majority vote using the controversial parliamentary maneuver known as reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the question of government intervention in the private insurance market, their most profound disagreement was over expanding coverage to the uninsured. The Democrats wanted to cover more than 30 million people over 10 years; Republicans said the nation could not even afford the entitlement programs, like Medicare, that already exist, much less start new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Passage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of 2009, the focus had been on the Senate, where the need for 60 votes to defeat a certain Republican filibuster had appeared to put the push for health care reform in greatest peril. But the two-track plan adopted by Democratic leaders &#8212; having the House pass the Senate plan with an agreed upon &#8220;sidecar&#8217;' of fixes &#8212; meant that the only new vote the Democrats would have to win would be on a set of fixes that would fall under budget reconciliation rules, making the issue immune to filibuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans railed against the tactic, saying Democrats were using a procedural gimmick to &#8220;jam&#8217;' the legislation through; Democrats replied by listing all the major bills the Republicans had passed via reconciliation when they were in the majority, including the Medicare drug plan and both Bush tax cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Obama, who had long avoided setting out a definitive set of his preferences, moved to the forefront after laying out an 11-page plan for changes to the Senate bill. The focus swung to Democrats in the House. Some conservative Democrats were unhappy with the bill&#8217;s cost, others with the weaker abortion provisions in the Senate bill. A number of liberals were angry over the loss of the public option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week after the health care summit, Mr. Obama bluntly challenged wavering Democrats to step up and support the bill, saying its failure would pose a greater political threat than passage. As he traveled to the districts of crucial representatives, Ms. Pelosi and her aides met almost nonstop with members of her caucus.? Three days before the vote the tide seemed to swing her way, as the Congressional Budget Office declared the bill would reduce the deficit by $138 billion over its first 10 years, and a number of anti-abortion Democrats decided that the language in the Senate bill would protect against the use of federal funds to? pay for abortion. But it was not until the morning of the vote, when Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan, who had become a leader of anti-abortion Democrats on the issue, said that Mr. Obama&#8217;s promised executive order would settle the issue for him, that it became clear that the bill would in fact pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the House passed the Senate&#8217;s bill, it passed and sent to the Senate the so-called &#8220;sidecar&#8217;' of fixes, which removed some provisions that had drawn criticism, such as a special deal on Medicaid for Nebraska, and adjusted other provisions that were unpopular with House Democrats, like the excise tax the Senate had imposed on high-cost insurance plans. In the Senate, Republicans succeeded in forcing Democrats to make minor changes in the language of the reconciliation bill, which also included an overhaul of the federal student loan program, meaning it needed to go back to the House for final passage, which it gave in a brisk session on the evening of March 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final House vote was 220 to 207, and the Senate vote was 56 to 43, with the Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Steps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first 18 months after the law&#8217;s passage, some important provisions were put in place, including tougher oversight of health insurers, the expansion of coverage to one million young adults and more protections for workers with pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, a combination of the law and economic pressures has forced major institutions to wrestle with the relentless rise in health care costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Colorado to Maryland, hospitals are scrambling to buy hospitals. Doctors are leaving small private practices. Large insurance companies are becoming more dominant as smaller ones disappear because they cannot stay competitive. States are simplifying decades of &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; rules and planning new ways for poor and rich alike to buy policies more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though critics say the law does little to reduce the costs of care, its passage touched off myriad efforts to pare widespread waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by November 2011, Federal officials had awarded nearly $516 million to states to help build new insurance exchanges, although some states whose officials are opposed to the law, like Florida and Alaska, have either refused the money or postponed any plans in hopes of getting the legislation overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without a significant expansion of Medicaid for the exchanges, state programs will soon be transformed through a provision that tries to standardize some of the byzantine eligibility and other rules. It requires states to offer a single, simple Internet application for not only Medicaid recipients but everyone seeking care on health exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an inspector general&#8217;s report from the Treasury Department indicated that fewer small businesses than expected had taken advantage of a tax credit under the law that encourages providing coverage for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Attempts to Repeal&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the November 2010 elections, Republicans took back control of the House and cut the Democratic majority in the Senate. After a delay caused by the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., the House voted on Jan. 19, 2011, to repeal the health care overhaul, marking what the new Republican majority in the chamber hailed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise and the start of an all-out effort to dismantle &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt;&#8217;s signature domestic policy achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House vote was the first stage of a Republican plan to use the party&#8217;s momentum coming out of the midterm elections to keep the White House on the defensive, and will be followed by a push to scale back federal spending. In response, the administration struck a more aggressive posture than it had during the campaign to sell the health care law to the public. With many House Democrats from swing districts having lost their seats in November, the remaining Democrats held overwhelmingly together in opposition to the repeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that a full-scale repeal would be blocked by the Senate and Mr. Obama, Republicans say they will try to withhold money that federal officials need to administer and enforce the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans also intended to go after specific provisions, including requirements that many employers to offer insurance to employees or pay a tax penalty and that most Americans obtain &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;health insurance&lt;/a&gt;.? Alternatively, Republicans say, they will try to prevent aggressive enforcement of the requirements by limiting money available to the &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/internal_revenue_service/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt;, which would collect the tax penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeal effort is part of a multipronged systematic strategy that House Republican leaders say will include trying to cut off money for the law, summoning Obama administration officials to testify at investigative hearings and encouraging state officials to attack the law in court as unconstitutional. For House Republicans, a repeal vote would also be an important, if largely symbolic, opening salvo against the president, his party and his policy agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans denounced the law as an intrusion by the government that would prompt employers to eliminate jobs, create an unsustainable entitlement program, saddle states and the federal government with unmanageable costs, and interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. Republicans also said the law would exacerbate the steep rise in the cost of medical services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their part, the Obama administration and Democrats, who largely lost the health care message war in the raucous legislative process, see the renewed debate as a chance to show that the law will be a boon to millions of Americans and hope to turn &#8220;Obamacare&#8221; from a pejorative into a tag for one of the president&#8217;s proudest achievements. Democrats argue that repeal would increase the number of uninsured; put insurers back in control of health insurance, allowing them to increase premiums at will; and lead to explosive growth in the &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;federal budget&lt;/a&gt; deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans said their package would probably include proposals to allow sales of health insurance across state lines; to help small businesses band together and buy insurance; to limit damages in &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/malpractice/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;medical malpractice&lt;/a&gt; suits; and to promote the use of health savings accounts, in combination with high-deductible insurance policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans also want to help states expand insurance pools for people with serious illnesses. The new law includes such pools, as an interim step until broader insurance coverage provisions take effect in 2014, but enrollment has fallen short of expectations. They have also proposed allowing people to buy insurance across state lines and to join together in &#8220;association health plans,&#8221; sponsored by trade and professional groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But state insurance officials have resisted such proposals, on the ground that they would weaken state authority to regulate insurance and to enforce consumer protections &#8212; a concern shared by Congressional Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Obama has responded to criticism by saying he would be willing to amend portions of the law. On Feb. 28, 2011, he endorsed bipartisan legislation that would allow states to opt out earlier from a range of requirements, including the mandate, if they could demonstrate that other methods would allow them to cover as many people, with insurance that is as comprehensive and affordable, as provided by the new law. The changes must also not increase the federal deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If states can meet those standards, they can ask to circumvent minimum benefit levels, structural requirements for insurance exchanges and the mandates that most individuals obtain coverage and that employers provide it. Washington would then help finance a state&#8217;s individualized health care system with federal money that would otherwise be spent there on insurance subsidies and tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospects for the proposal appear dim. Congress would have to approve the change through legislation, and House Republican leaders said that they were committed to repealing the law, not amending it. Even if the change were approved, it could be difficult for states to meet the federal requirements for the waivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Court Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after Mr. Obama signed the bill, states began filing challenges to it in federal court. Twenty states,?led by Florida&#8217;s former attorney general, &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/bill_mccollum/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;Bill McCollum&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for governor, banded together to file suit in federal district court in Pensacola, Fla. The first challenge was filed by the attorney general of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2010, a federal judge in Detroit &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/health/policy/08health.html?ref=health_care_reform&gt;became the first to rul&lt;/a&gt;e on the lawsuits, upholding the government&#8217;s position. The next month, a federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/health/policy/01lawsuit.html?ref=health_care_reform&gt;did the same.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2010, a federal judge in Richmond issued the &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/policy/14health.html?hp=&amp;amp;pagewanted=print&gt;first ruling against the law&lt;/a&gt;, calling the individual mandate unconstitutional. The case centered on whether Congress had authority under the Commerce Clause to compel citizens to buy a commercial product &#8212; namely health insurance &#8212; in the name of regulating an interstate economic market. Plaintiffs in the lawsuits argued that there effectively would be no limits on federal power, and that the government could force people to buy American cars or, as the judge remarked at one hearing, &#8220;to eat asparagus.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court&#8217;s position on the Commerce Clause has evolved through four signature cases over the last 68 years, with three decided since 1995. Two of the opinions established broad powers to regulate even personal commercial decisions that may influence a broader economic scheme. But other cases have limited regulation to &#8220;activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major question, therefore, has been whether the income tax penalties levied against those who do not obtain health insurance are designed to regulate &#8220;activity&#8221; or, as Virginia&#8217;s solicitor general, E. Duncan Getchell Jr., has argued, &#8220;inactivity&#8221; that is beyond Congress&#8217;s reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Department lawyers responded that individuals cannot opt out of the medical market, and that the act of not obtaining insurance is an active decision to pay for health care out of pocket. They say that such decisions, taken in the aggregate, shift billions of dollars in uncompensated care costs to governments, &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/hospitals/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and the privately insured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, a judge in Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., became the second to rule against the health care law. His ruling came in the most prominent of the more than 20 legal challenges mounted against some aspect of the sweeping health law. He declared the entire act void, including provisions that have already taken effect, like requirements that insurers cover children regardless of pre-existing conditions. Three other federal judges, meanwhile, have upheld the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2011, a two-judge panel of the Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit upheld the law, in what was the first of three appellate decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2011, a divided three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the so-called individual mandate, which is considered the centerpiece of the law, ruling that Congress exceeded its powers to regulate commerce when it decided to require people to buy health insurance. But the court held that while that provision was unconstitutional, the rest of the wide-ranging law could stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2011, a federal appellate court in Richmond, Va., &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/health/policy/09virginia.html&gt;threw out a pair of cases&lt;/a&gt; challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, ruling for varying reasons that the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to sue. In the process, two of the three judges on the panel volunteered that they would have upheld the law if they had been able to rule on the substance of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/health/policy/appeals-court-upholds-health-care-law.html?scp=2&amp;amp;sq=health%20care%20reform&amp;amp;st=cse&gt;a federal appeals court in Washington upheld the law &lt;/a&gt;in a decision written by a prominent conservative jurist, Judge &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/laurence_h_silberman/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;Laurence H. Silberman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supreme Court Steps In&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 28, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to review the decision from the 11th Circuit invalidating the mandate.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2011, the court?&lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/us/supreme-court-to-hear-case-challenging-health-law.html?ref=global-home&gt;agreed to hear a challenge to the law&lt;/a&gt;. The court&#8217;s decision to step in had been expected, but the order answered many questions about just how the case would proceed. The court scheduled five and half hours of argument instead of the usual one, a testament to the importance of the case, which has as its center an epic clash between the federal government and the 26 states that together filed a challenge to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, the justices held a three-day hearing: two hours of arguments on whether Congress overstepped its constitutional authority, 90 minutes on whether the mandate may be severed from the balance of the law if Congress did go too far, and an hour each on the Medicaid and Anti-Injunction Act questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court heard three appeals, two from challengers to the law and a third from the Obama administration. The appeal involving the 26 states is Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services, No. 11-400. A second challenge, from a business group and two individuals, is National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393. The federal government&#8217;s appeal is Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida, No. 11-398.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing Variations From State to State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a major surprise on the politically charged health care law, the Obama administration said on Dec. 16, 2011, &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/health/policy/health-care-law-to-allow-states-to-pick-benefits.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=Health%20Care%20Law%20Will%20Let%20States%20Tailor%20Benefits&amp;amp;st=cse&gt;that it would not define a single uniform set &lt;/a&gt;of &#8220;essential health benefits&#8221; that must be provided by insurers for tens of millions of Americans. Instead, it will allow each state to specify the benefits within broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move would allow significant variations in benefits from state to state, much like the current differences in state &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; programs and the &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/state_childrens_health_insurance_program_schip/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program&lt;/a&gt;. By giving states the discretion to specify essential benefits, the Obama administration sought to deflect one of the most powerful arguments made by Republican critics of &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt;&#8217;s health care overhaul &#8212; that it was imposing a rigid, bureaucrat-controlled health system on Americans and threatening the quality of care. Opponents say that the federal government is forcing a one-size-fits-all standard for &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;health insurance&lt;/a&gt; and usurping state authority to regulate the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new law lists 10 categories of &#8220;essential health benefits&#8221; that must be provided by insurance offered in the individual and small-group markets, starting in January 2014. These include preventive care, emergency services, maternity care, hospital and doctors&#8217; services and prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle Over Birth Control??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, facing vocal opposition from religious leaders and an escalating political fight, &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/health/policy/obama-addresses-ire-on-health-insurance-contraception-rule.html?ref=politics&gt;the White House sought to ease mounting objections to a new administration rule&lt;/a&gt; that would require &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;health insurance&lt;/a&gt; plans &#8212; including those offered by Catholic universities and charities &#8212; to offer &lt;a href=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/birth-control-and-family-planning/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; to women free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Republican presidential candidates and conservative leaders sought to frame the rule as showing &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;President Obama&lt;/a&gt;&#8217;s insensitivity to religious beliefs, Mr. Obama&#8217;s aides promised to explore ways to make it more palatable to religious-affiliated institutions, perhaps by allowing some employers to make side insurance plans available that are not directly paid for by the institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_a_boehner/index.html?inline=nyt-per&gt;John A. Boehner&lt;/a&gt; stepped into the battle, saying that &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/us/politics/boehner-vows-to-fight-contraception-rule.html?hp&gt;House Republicans would push legislation to challenge the policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Senate, Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, introduced a sweeping amendment to the Obama legislation that would permit employers and insurers to refuse to provide or pay for coverage of &#8220;specific items or services&#8221; if the coverage would be &#8220;contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer or other entity offering the plan.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainty Over States and Medicaid Expansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court ruled that a huge expansion of Medicaid envisioned in the health care law was an option, not a mandate, for states. &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/uncertainty-over-whether-states-will-choose-to-expand-medicaid.html?ref=us&gt;One of the most important questions created by the court&#8217;s decision is whether states will take the option.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Medicaid expansion is a central part of the law, accounting for roughly half of all the uninsured people expected to gain coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It estimates that 17 million uninsured people will gain coverage through Medicaid, at a cost to the federal government of $930 billion from 2014 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While upholding the expansion of Medicaid, the Supreme Court limited the power of the federal government to secure compliance by penalizing states that refuse to go alongChief Justice Roberts said the federal government could not compel states to comply by cutting off all the federal money they receive for existing Medicaid programs. The threatened loss of so much federal money &#8212; more than 10 percent of state budgets &#8212; &#8220;is economic dragooning that leaves the states with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion,&#8221; the chief justice said. &#8220;A state could hardly anticipate that Congress&#8217;s reservation of the right to &#8216;alter&#8217; or &#8216;amend&#8217; the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief justice said Congress had put &#8220;a gun to the head&#8221; of states by requiring them to expand Medicaid or risk the loss of all federal Medicaid money. &#8220;States,&#8221; he said, &#8220;must have a genuine choice.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the federal government and the states share Medicaid costs, with the federal government paying an average of 57 percent of the total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new law, the federal government will pay the full cost of covering those newly eligible for Medicaid for three years, from 2014 to 2016. The federal share will then gradually decline; it will be 90 percent, starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many state officials worry that Congress will reduce the federal share and shift more costs to the states as it seeks ways to reduce the &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;federal budget&lt;/a&gt; deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican critics are also mounting a challenge to President Obama&#8217;s interpretation of another important provision, under which the federal &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/us/critics-of-health-care-law-prepare-to-battle-over-insurance-exchange-subsidies.html?ref=us&gt;government will subsidize health insurance&lt;/a&gt;for millions of low- and middle-income people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2014, the law requires most Americans to have health insurance. It also offers subsidies to help people pay for insurance bought through markets known as insurance exchanges.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is whether the subsidies will be available in exchanges set up and run by the federal government in states that fail or refuse to establish their own exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say the law allows subsidies only for people who obtain coverage through state-run exchanges. The White House says the law can be read to allow subsidies for people who get coverage in federal exchanges as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law says that &#8220;each state shall&#8221; establish an exchange. But Washington could be running the exchanges in one-third to half of states, where local officials have been moving slowly or openly resisting the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute has huge practical implications. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 23 million uninsured people will gain coverage through exchanges and that all but five million of them will qualify for subsidies, averaging more than $6,000 a year per person. Subsidies, in the form of tax credits, will be available to people with incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount ($23,050 to $92,200 for a family of four).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some supporters of the law say Congress may have made a mistake in drafting this section. But, they add, the intent of Congress is clear: subsidies should be available in federal as well as state exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bracing for a Shortage of Doctors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With access to medical insurance being extended to tens of millions of people, the question becomes: Who will provide their care? The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that &lt;a title=Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen With Health Law href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/health/policy/too-few-doctors-in-many-us-communities.html&gt;in 2015 the country will have 62,900 fewer doctors than needed&lt;/a&gt;. And that number will more than double by 2025, as the expansion of insurance coverage and the aging of baby boomers drive up demand for care. Even without the health care law, the shortfall of doctors in 2025 would still exceed 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts, including many who support the law, say there is little that the government or the medical profession will be able to do to close the gap by 2014, when the law begins extending coverage to about 30 million Americans. It typically takes a decade to train a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts describe a doctor shortage as an &#8220;invisible problem.&#8221; Patients still get care, but the process is often slow and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, across the country, fewer than half of primary care clinicians were &lt;a href=http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/72046.pdf&gt;accepting new Medicaid patients&lt;/a&gt; as of 2008, making it hard for the poor to find care even when they are eligible for Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid accounts for more than one-third of the overall growth in coverage in President Obama&#8217;s health care law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major factor increasing demand &#8212; along with expansion of coverage in the law and simple population growth &#8212; is the aging of the baby boom generation. &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; officials predict that enrollment will surge to 73.2 million in 2025, up 44 percent from 50.7 million in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool of doctors has not kept pace, and will not, health experts said. Medical school enrollment is increasing, but not as fast as the population. The number of training positions for medical school graduates is lagging. Younger doctors are on average working fewer hours than their predecessors. And about a third of the country&#8217;s doctors are &lt;a href=http://www.innovationlabs.com/pa_future/1/background_docs/AAMC%20Complexities%20of%20physician%20demand,%202008.pdf&gt;55 or older&lt;/a&gt;, and nearing retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physician compensation is also an issue. The proportion of medical students choosing to enter primary care has declined in the past 15 years, as average earnings for primary care doctors and specialists, like orthopedic surgeons and radiologists, have diverged. A study by the Medical Group Management Association &lt;a href=http://www.mgma.com/blog/Highlights-of-MGMAs-2011-Physician-Compensation-survey&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, primary care doctors made about $200,000 a year. Specialists often made twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has sought to ease the shortage. The health care law increases Medicaid&#8217;s primary care payment rates in 2013 and 2014. It also includes money to train new primary care doctors, reward them for working in underserved communities and strengthen community health centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the provisions within the law are expected to increase the number of primary care doctors by perhaps 3,000 in the coming decade. Communities around the country need about 45,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance Rebates Seen as Selling Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=Insurance Rebates Seen as Selling Point for Health Law href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/health/policy/insurance-rebates-seen-as-early-benefit-of-health-care-law.html?pagewanted=all&gt;The health care law requires insurers to give out annual rebates&lt;/a&gt; by Aug. 1, starting in 2012, if less than 80 percent of the premium dollars they collect go toward medical care. For insurers covering large employers, the threshold is 85 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, insurers will pay out $1.1 billion in 2012, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, with an average rebate of $151 per household. The highest average amounts are going to people in Vermont ($807 per family), Alaska ($622) and Alabama ($518). No rebates will be issued in New Mexico or Rhode Island, because all the insurers in those states met the 80/20 requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the percentage of insurance companies that owe rebates in 2012 is relatively small, about 14 percent, many giants of the industry are on the list. They include Aetna, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthCare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama is highlighting the rebates as a tangible early benefit of the controversial legislation; on the day the Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional last month, he said millions of Americans would see rebates because their insurance companies had &#8220;spent too much on things like administrative costs and C.E.O. bonuses, and not enough on your health care.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-insured employers, which cover more than half the nation&#8217;s workers, are exempt from the new rule, as are &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;. And of the 75 million people in health plans subject to the rule, only about 17 percent, or 12.8 million, will see a rebate in 2012, according to the Obama administration. Many who buy coverage directly from insurers are receiving checks. But in most cases rebates are being sent to employers, who can chose to put them toward future premium costs instead of distributing them to workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the rebate provision could prove a potent selling point for a law that remains unpopular with many Americans, not to mention a well-timed tool for the Obama re-election campaign. Premiums &#8212; and anger toward insurance companies &#8212; keep rising: the cost of employer-sponsored family health plans jumped by nine percent in 2011 to more than $15,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies say the rebate requirement does not address swiftly rising medical costs, which they say are the main reason premiums keep going up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping Coverage Affordable for Workers With Families&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the new health care law is known as the Affordable Care Act, Democrats in Congress and advocates for low-income people say &lt;a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/us/ambiguity-in-health-law-could-make-family-coverage-too-costly.html&gt;coverage may be unaffordable for millions of Americans because of a cramped reading of the law&lt;/a&gt; by the administration and by the &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/internal_revenue_service/index.html?inline=nyt-org&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under rules proposed by the service, some working-class families would be unable to afford family coverage offered by their employers, and yet they would not qualify for subsidies provided by the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight revolves around how to define &#8220;affordable&#8221; under provisions of the law that are ambiguous. The definition could have huge practical consequences, affecting who gets help from the government in buying &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/health-insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;health insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the law, most Americans will be required to have health insurance starting in 2014. Low- and middle-income people can get tax credits and other subsidies to help pay their premiums, unless they have access to affordable coverage from an employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law specifies that employer-sponsored &lt;a href=http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; is not affordable if a worker&#8217;s share of the premium is more than 9.5 percent of the worker&#8217;s household income. The I.R.S. says this calculation should be based solely on the cost of individual coverage for the employee, what the worker would pay for &#8220;self-only coverage.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say the administration should also take account of the costs of covering a spouse and children because family coverage typically costs much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I.R.S. issued final rules for the health insurance premium tax credit in May, but deferred its final decision on the affordability of family coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration is trying to strike a balance. If the rules allow more people to qualify for subsidies, it would increase costs to the federal government. If the rules require employers to provide affordable coverage to dependents as well as workers, it would increase costs for many employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employers and members of Congress have suggested a possible compromise. The government would still look at the cost of &#8220;self-only coverage&#8221; in deciding whether insurance was affordable to an employee. If family coverage under the employer&#8217;s plan was too expensive, a family could get subsidies to buy insurance for dependents in the exchange, and the employer would not be penalized.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><span class="timestamp">Updated: Sept. 24, 2012<br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>After decades of failed attempts by a string of Democratic presidents and a year of bitter partisan combat, President Obama signed legislation on March 23, 2010, to overhaul the nation&#8217;s health care system and guarantee access to medical insurance for tens of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act seeks to extend insurance to more than 30 million people, primarily by expanding Medicaid and providing federal subsidies to help lower- and middle-income Americans buy private coverage. It will create insurance exchanges for those buying individual policies and prohibit insurers from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions. To reduce the soaring cost of Medicare, it creates a panel of experts to limit government reimbursement to only those treatments shown to be effective, and creates incentives for providers to &#8220;bundle&#8217;' services rather than charge by individual procedure.</p>
<p>The law will cost the government about $938 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congressional_budget_office/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Congressional Budget Office</a>, which has also estimated that it will reduce the federal deficit by $138 billion over a decade.</p>
<p>The law was the largest single legislative achievement of Mr. Obama&#8217;s first two years in office, and the most controversial. Not a single Republican voted for the final version, and Republicans across the country campaigned on a promise to repeal the bill. In January 2011, shortly after they took control of the House, Republicans voted 245 to 189 in favor of repeal, in what both sides agreed was largely a symbolic act, given Democratic control of the Senate and White House.</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court Largely Upholds the Law</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The case centered on the question of whether Congress has the constitutional power to require people to purchase health insurance or face a penalty through the so-called individual mandate.</p>
<p>In June 2012, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html?hp">largely let stand the health care reform law stand.</a> The high court&#8217;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">5 to 4 decision</a> was a striking victory for the president and Congressional Democrats, with a majority, including the conservative chief justice,<a title="John G. Roberts Jr." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/john_g_jr_roberts/index.html"> John G. Roberts Jr.</a>, affirming the central legislative pillar of Mr. Obama&#8217;s term.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision did significantly restrict one major portion of the law: the expansion of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicaid</a>, the government health-insurance program for low-income and sick people. The ruling gives states some flexibility not to expand their Medicaid programs, without paying the same financial penalties that the law called for.</p>
<p>Even with the court&#8217;s decision, the debate over health care remains far from over, with Republicans vowing to carry on their fight against the law. The Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has promised to undo it if elected.</p>
<p>For more background on the Supreme Court decision and hearings, click <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/affordable_care_act/index.html?8qa">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Battle Continues<br /></strong></p>
<p>On July 11, less than two weeks after the Supreme Court decision, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/health/policy/house-votes-again-to-repeal-health-law.html?hp">the House passed a bill to repeal President Obama&#8217;s health care</a> law. The bill was approved by a vote of 244 to 185, with five Democrats supporting repeal.</p>
<p>It has no chance of approval in the Senate and would face a veto from Mr. Obama if it ever got to him. But the House debate exposed the depth of passion over efforts to remake the health care system and suggested that the fight would continue next year, regardless of who wins the November elections for president and Congress.</p>
<p>Republican governors and state legislators also began to plan a new approach that could have the effect of undercutting large parts of the law, which relies heavily on state governments for implementation.</p>
<p>Leaning on the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling, the governors of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina said they would reject the law&#8217;s proposal to expand Medicaid, and others said they were leaning toward rejecting it.?</p>
<p>At the end of July, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on Medicaid &#8212; which essentially made its expansion optional for states &#8212; would probably <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/health/policy/3-million-more-may-lack-insurance-due-to-ruling-study-says.html?hp">mean that 3 million fewer people would be insured under the law. </a></p>
<p>The budget office predicted that six million fewer people will be insured by Medicaid. But half of them, it said, will probably gain private insurance coverage through health insurance exchanges to be established in all states. Even though the law calls for the government to spend more per person on subsidies for insurance bought through exchanges than on Medicaid, the changes would reduce the law&#8217;s cost by about 7 percent, or $84 billion between 2012 and 2022, the budget office said.</p>
<p><strong>Another Issue: Insurance Exchanges</strong></p>
<p><a title="Liking It or Not, States Prepare for Health Law" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/us/like-it-or-not-states-prepare-for-health-law.html">The law requires all states to have exchanges</a>, which are essentially online marketplaces where small businesses and individuals can shop for private health plans,?in place by January 2014, when a requirement takes effect for most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. People with incomes between 133 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level can get federal tax subsidies through exchanges to make the price of coverage more affordable.</p>
<p>But all states must have plans for the exchanges ready by Nov. 16, 2012, or leave it to the federal government to run the exchanges for them. That is just 10 days after Election Day, which is likely to decide the future of the law.</p>
<p class="showhidetxt"><a id="more" title="More" href="javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');">Read More...</a></p>
<div id="moretxt"><strong></strong>
<p>By late September 2012, only 13 states and the District of Columbia had formally committed to running their own exchanges. All of them but Rhode Island, whose governor, Lincoln Chafee, is an independent, are led by Democrats. The Republican governors in six states &#8212; Alaska, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, South Carolina and Texas &#8212; said they would not create state-run exchanges, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. So did New Hampshire, where Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, faced opposition from the Republican-controlled legislature.</p>
<p>Most of the remaining states, 22 of them run by Republicans, were exploring their options. At least four of them &#8212; Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada and New Mexico &#8212; had done enough planning to meet the November deadline should they decide to run their own exchanges, according to officials. <a href="http://exchange.nv.gov/">Nevada had already created its exchange</a>, appointed its board and hired its executive director. Most Republican governors are waiting for the outcome of the presidential race before making a final decision.</p>
<p>Many states run by Republicans say they want to be prepared in case the law survives. (Even if Mr. Romney wins, repealing the law will require Congressional approval, which will be difficult if Democrats retain control of the Senate.)</p>
<p>Republicans who support state-run exchanges say they are embracing a fundamental conservative belief: that states should make their own decisions rather than cede control to the federal government. But groups that oppose the law have sent emissaries around the country to argue that deferring to the federal government is a shrewder move.</p>
<p>Many Republicans in state legislatures do not need convincing: they are against state-run exchanges. That could make the challenge of creating them tough even if the framework is in place by November, because most states need legislative approval to establish them. Another option is a &#8220;partnership&#8221; exchange, one that is created by the federal government but that the state would have a role in operating.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<strong></strong>
<p>The Democrats&#8217; desire for universal access to health insurance runs deep. President Franklin D. Roosevelt hoped to include some kind of national health insurance program in Social Security in 1935. President Harry S. Truman proposed a national health care program with an insurance fund into which everyone would pay. Since then, every Democratic president and several Republican presidents have wanted to provide affordable coverage to more Americans.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton offered the most ambitious proposal and suffered the most spectacular failure. Working for 10 months behind closed doors, Clinton aides wrote a 240,000-word bill. Scores of lobbyists picked it apart. Congressional Democrats took potshots at it. And Republicans used the specter of government-run health care to help them take control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1994.</p>
<p>One of the most significant differences between 1993-94 and 2009-10 is that employers and business groups, alarmed at the soaring cost of health care, took a seat at the negotiating table. Insurance companies, which helped defeat the Clinton plan, began 2009 by saying they accept the need for change and want a seat at the table. As the bills developed, however, they became strong opponents of some Democratic proposals, especially one to create a government-run insurance plan as an alternative to their offerings.</p>
<p>In his budget for 2010, Mr. Obama gave an indication of the scope of his ambitions on health care reform when he asked Congress to set aside more than $600 billion as a down payment on efforts to remake the health care system over the next 10 years. But after sending Congress his budget plan, Mr. Obama&#8217;s White House, displaying a surprisingly light touch, encouraged Democrats in Congress to make the hard decisions.</p>
<p>By the end of March 2009, the chairmen of five Congressional committees had reached a consensus on the main ingredients of legislation, and insurance industry representatives had made some major concessions. The chairmen, all Democrats, agreed that everyone must carry insurance and that employers should be required to help pay for it. They also agreed that the government should offer a public health insurance plan as an alternative to private insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Separate Democratic Bills</strong></p>
<p>Democrats worked on three separate paths to develop legislation in the summer of 2009. In June, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/health/policy/15health.html">House Democratic leaders introduced their bill</a>, which in addition to a public plan included efforts to slow the pace of Medicare spending, a tax on high-income people and penalties for businesses that do not insure their workers. After a revolt by a conservative group of &#8220;Blue Dog&#8217;' Democrats that led to more exemptions for businesses, the plan was adopted by three committees without Republican support.</p>
<p>In the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee worked on a bill with a public insurance plan, while the Senate Finance Committee, led by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, worked on a bill that sought to avoid one, which Mr. Baucus thought was necessary to gain bipartisan support.</p>
<p>In July, the Senate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/us/politics/16health.html">health committee passed its bill on a party-line vote of 13 to 10</a>, with all Republicans opposing the package. Both Republicans and Democrats acknowledged that the health committee bill was just part of what would eventually be a single Senate measure.</p>
<p><strong>The Battle for Public Opinion</strong></p>
<p>During the Congressional recess in August 2009, the White House appeared to lose control of the public debate over health care reform to a wave of conservative protests.</p>
<p>Democratic Party officials acknowledged that the growing intensity of the opposition to the president&#8217;s health care plans &#8212; plans likened on talk radio to something out of Hitler&#8217;s Germany, lampooned by protesters at Congressional town-hall-style meetings and vilified in television commercials &#8212; had caught them off guard.</p>
<p>In September, Mr. Obama confronted a critical Congress and a skeptical nation, decrying the &#8220;scare tactics&#8221; of his opponents and presenting his most forceful case yet for a sweeping health care overhaul that has eluded Washington for generations.</p>
<p>When Mr. Obama said it was not true that the Democrats were proposing to provide health coverage to illegal immigrants, Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina yelled back, &#8220;You lie!&#8221; Mr. Wilson apologized but his outburst led to a six-day national debate on civility and decorum, and the House formally rebuked him on Sept. 15.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s speech appeared to restore momentum to the reform effort, at least for the moment, according to polls that followed.</p>
<p><strong>The Baucus Bill</strong></p>
<p>When Senator Baucus introduced his long-awaited plan in the fall of 2009, the bill closely resembled what Mr. Obama said he wanted, except that it did not include a new government insurance plan to compete with private insurers.</p>
<p>Unlike the other bills, the Baucus plan would impose a new excise tax on insurance companies that sell high-end policies. The bill would not require employers to offer coverage. But employers with more than 50 workers would have to reimburse the government for some or all of the cost of subsidies provided to employees who buy insurance on their own.</p>
<p>The bill got a significant boost when the Congressional Budget Office announced that despite its price tag, it would reduce the federal deficit by slowing the rate of health-care spending.</p>
<p>In October 2009, the committee voted to approve the legislation. The vote was 14 to 9, with all Republicans opposed except for Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. Two weeks later, Ms. Snowe&#8217;s support was lost, when Mr. Reid, the majority leader, announced he would include a public option in the legislation he took to the Senate floor.</p>
<p><strong>The House Bill Passes</strong></p>
<strong></strong>
<p>Before Speaker Pelosi put the House bill to a vote, she had to broker a series of compromises that ultimately brought along just enough support from conservative Democrats to win passage. The biggest changes concerned the public option plan, which would have to negotiate rates just as private insurers do, rather than offering a rate set slightly above what Medicare pays; the plan would also confront strict controls on abortion. After heavy lobbying by Catholic bishops, the measure was amended to tighten restrictions on abortion coverage in subsidized plans bought through the insurance exchanges, to insure that no federal money was used to pay for an abortion. Both changes angered Ms. Pelosi&#8217;s base of liberal Democrats, but they chose to support the bill nonetheless.</p>
<p>Democrats said the House measure &#8212; paid for through new fees and taxes, along with cuts in Medicare &#8212; would extend coverage to 36 million people now without insurance while creating a government health insurance program. It would end insurance company practices like not covering pre-existing conditions or dropping people when they become ill. And despite its price tag, they pointed to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that said it would reduce the deficit over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>In a sign of potential difficulties ahead, some centrist Democrats said they voted for the legislation so they could seek improvements in it in a conference with the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>The Senate&#8217;s Merged Bill </strong></p>
<p>By early November 2009, the broad outlines of the bill Senator Reid would introduce on the Senate floor were clear &#8212; it would include the public option that was part of the health committee&#8217;s bill, but with an &#8220;opt out&#8217;' provision for states, and many of the taxes and fees written in to the Finance Committee&#8217;s version.</p>
<p>Though broadly similar to the House bill, Mr. Reid&#8217;s proposal differed in important ways. It would, for example, increase the Medicare payroll tax on high-income people and impose a new excise tax on high-cost &#8220;Cadillac health plans&#8221; offered by employers to their employees. Mr. Reid&#8217;s bill would not go as far as the House bill in limiting access to abortion. And while he would require most Americans to obtain health insurance, he would impose less stringent penalties on people who did not comply.</p>
<p>The official cost analysis released by the nonpartisan <a title="More articles about Congressional Budget Office, U.S." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congressional_budget_office/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Congressional Budget Office</a> showed that Mr. Reid&#8217;s bill came in under the $900 billion goal suggested by Mr. Obama. But 24 million people would still be uninsured in 2019, the budget office said. About one-third of them would be illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would reduce deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and cover 36 million people, but still leave 18 million uninsured in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Passage in the Senate<br /></strong></p>
<p>As debate began, Mr. Reid began searching for changes that could pull together the 60 votes that would be needed to avoid a Republican filibuster. The Democratic caucus contains 60 members, including two independents, but one of those independents, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said he would block a vote on any bill containing a public option. To win his vote, it was dropped, as was a compromise proposal to expand Medicare to allow people aged 55 to 64 to buy in to the plan &#8212; both moves that angered the Senate&#8217;s liberals, who pointed out that Mr. Lieberman had spoken in favor of the Medicare expansion three months before.</p>
<p>The last? Democrat to come on board was Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who won a series of changes: a provision to strip the insurance industry of its anti-trust exemption was dropped; language was added to allow states to decide to block plans covering abortion from their insurance exchanges; and the bill now provides Nebraska with additional Medicaid funds.</p>
<p>Republicans vowed to use every parliamentary device at their disposal to slow the measure, which they said was being rammed through the Senate in an unseemly rush. But with Mr. Nelson on board, Mr. Reid&#8217;s bill survived the first serious procedural hurdle by reaching the 60 vote mark needed to fend off a filibuster.</p>
<p>When the roll for the final vote was called at 7:05 a.m. on Dec. 24, 2009, it was a solemn moment. Senators called out &#8220;aye&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; Senator Robert C. Byrd, the 92-year-old Democrat from West Virginia, deviated slightly from the protocol. &#8220;This is for my friend Ted Kennedy,&#8221; Mr. Byrd said. &#8220;Aye!&#8221;</p>
<p>The 60-to-39 party-line vote came on the 25th straight day of debate on the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>An Upset and a Scramble </strong></p>
<p>But less than a month later, the victory of Scott Brown, a previously little known Republican state senator, in the Massachusetts special election to fill Mr. Kennedy&#8217;s seat, upset all calculations and left Democrats scrambling for approaches that might allow them to pass some version of the bill.?</p>
<p>The most widely discussed approach called for the House to approve the Senate bill &#8212; thereby avoiding a filibuster if the Senate needed to vote on a compromise bill. That vote would be preceded by the passing of a separate bill containing the changes both houses could agree to. Democratic leaders believed that most of those could be put into a so-called budget reconciliation bill, which under Senate rules cannot be filibustered. But House Democrats were reluctant to move until the Senate moved first, and several conservative Democrats said they opposed using reconciliation. In mid-January 2010, Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi signalled that they did not expect quick action.</p>
<p>In his State of the Union address to Congress on Jan. 27, 2010, Mr. Obama called on Congress to finish the job. He appealed once more for Republicans to put forward ideas that could lead to a bipartisan approach. He added, &#8220;Do not walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let&#8217;s find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he did not lay out his preferences for the bill&#8217;s final form or lay out a means of passage. Almost two weeks later, in an interview during the Super Bowl&#8217;s pre-game show, Mr. Obama announced a bipartisan, half-day summit at the White House,?a high-profile gambit that would allow Americans to watch as Democrats and Republicans tried to break their political impasse. The plan would put Republicans on the spot to offer their own ideas on health care and show whether both sides were willing to work together.</p>
<p><strong>Republican Health Ideas </strong></p>
<p>Republicans never offered a unified health care bill, but the party&#8217;s Congressional leaders sketched out a fairly well-developed set of ideas intended to make health insurance more widely available and affordable, by emphasizing tax incentives and state innovations, with no new federal mandates and only a modest expansion of the federal safety net.</p>
<p>The Republicans rely more on the market and less on government. They would not require employers to provide insurance. They opposed the Democrats&#8217; call for a big expansion of Medicaid, which Republicans said would burden states with huge long-term liabilities.</p>
<p>While the Congressional Budget Office has not analyzed all the Republican proposals, it is clear that they would not provide coverage to anything like the number of people &#8212; more than 30 million &#8212; who would gain insurance under the Democrats&#8217; proposals.</p>
<p>But Republicans say they can make incremental progress without the economic costs they contend the Democratic plans pose to the nation. As one way to encourage competition and drive down costs, Republican members of Congress want to make it easier for insurance companies to sell their policies across state lines, an idea included in a limited form in the Democratic bills.</p>
<p><strong>The Health Care Summit</strong></p>
<strong></strong>
<p>On Feb. 25, 2010, Congressional Democrats and Republicans joined Mr. Obama at Blair House, across the street from the White House, for an extraordinary seven-hour televised debate on the intricacies of heath care reform.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats tried to make the case that the two parties were closer than they thought, with the implication that their bill was centrist and would be acceptable to mainstream voters. Republicans countered that the gap was vast, that the bill was out of touch with what the country wanted and that Mr. Obama should throw it out and start over.</p>
<p>Republicans said there was no way they would vote for Mr. Obama&#8217;s bill, and Democrats were talking openly about pushing it through Congress on a simple majority vote using the controversial parliamentary maneuver known as reconciliation.</p>
<p>Beyond the question of government intervention in the private insurance market, their most profound disagreement was over expanding coverage to the uninsured. The Democrats wanted to cover more than 30 million people over 10 years; Republicans said the nation could not even afford the entitlement programs, like Medicare, that already exist, much less start new ones.</p>
<p><strong>Final Passage<br /></strong></p>
<p>For most of 2009, the focus had been on the Senate, where the need for 60 votes to defeat a certain Republican filibuster had appeared to put the push for health care reform in greatest peril. But the two-track plan adopted by Democratic leaders &#8212; having the House pass the Senate plan with an agreed upon &#8220;sidecar&#8217;' of fixes &#8212; meant that the only new vote the Democrats would have to win would be on a set of fixes that would fall under budget reconciliation rules, making the issue immune to filibuster.</p>
<p>Republicans railed against the tactic, saying Democrats were using a procedural gimmick to &#8220;jam&#8217;' the legislation through; Democrats replied by listing all the major bills the Republicans had passed via reconciliation when they were in the majority, including the Medicare drug plan and both Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama, who had long avoided setting out a definitive set of his preferences, moved to the forefront after laying out an 11-page plan for changes to the Senate bill. The focus swung to Democrats in the House. Some conservative Democrats were unhappy with the bill&#8217;s cost, others with the weaker abortion provisions in the Senate bill. A number of liberals were angry over the loss of the public option.</p>
<p>A week after the health care summit, Mr. Obama bluntly challenged wavering Democrats to step up and support the bill, saying its failure would pose a greater political threat than passage. As he traveled to the districts of crucial representatives, Ms. Pelosi and her aides met almost nonstop with members of her caucus.? Three days before the vote the tide seemed to swing her way, as the Congressional Budget Office declared the bill would reduce the deficit by $138 billion over its first 10 years, and a number of anti-abortion Democrats decided that the language in the Senate bill would protect against the use of federal funds to? pay for abortion. But it was not until the morning of the vote, when Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan, who had become a leader of anti-abortion Democrats on the issue, said that Mr. Obama&#8217;s promised executive order would settle the issue for him, that it became clear that the bill would in fact pass.</p>
<p>After the House passed the Senate&#8217;s bill, it passed and sent to the Senate the so-called &#8220;sidecar&#8217;' of fixes, which removed some provisions that had drawn criticism, such as a special deal on Medicaid for Nebraska, and adjusted other provisions that were unpopular with House Democrats, like the excise tax the Senate had imposed on high-cost insurance plans. In the Senate, Republicans succeeded in forcing Democrats to make minor changes in the language of the reconciliation bill, which also included an overhaul of the federal student loan program, meaning it needed to go back to the House for final passage, which it gave in a brisk session on the evening of March 25th.</p>
<p>The final House vote was 220 to 207, and the Senate vote was 56 to 43, with the Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Steps<br /></strong></p>
<p>In the first 18 months after the law&#8217;s passage, some important provisions were put in place, including tougher oversight of health insurers, the expansion of coverage to one million young adults and more protections for workers with pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>More broadly, a combination of the law and economic pressures has forced major institutions to wrestle with the relentless rise in health care costs.</p>
<p>From Colorado to Maryland, hospitals are scrambling to buy hospitals. Doctors are leaving small private practices. Large insurance companies are becoming more dominant as smaller ones disappear because they cannot stay competitive. States are simplifying decades of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicaid</a> rules and planning new ways for poor and rich alike to buy policies more easily.</p>
<p>Even though critics say the law does little to reduce the costs of care, its passage touched off myriad efforts to pare widespread waste.</p>
<p>And by November 2011, Federal officials had awarded nearly $516 million to states to help build new insurance exchanges, although some states whose officials are opposed to the law, like Florida and Alaska, have either refused the money or postponed any plans in hopes of getting the legislation overturned.</p>
<p>Even without a significant expansion of Medicaid for the exchanges, state programs will soon be transformed through a provision that tries to standardize some of the byzantine eligibility and other rules. It requires states to offer a single, simple Internet application for not only Medicaid recipients but everyone seeking care on health exchanges.</p>
<p>But an inspector general&#8217;s report from the Treasury Department indicated that fewer small businesses than expected had taken advantage of a tax credit under the law that encourages providing coverage for employees.</p>
<p><strong>Republican Attempts to Repeal<br /> </strong></p>
<p>In the November 2010 elections, Republicans took back control of the House and cut the Democratic majority in the Senate. After a delay caused by the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., the House voted on Jan. 19, 2011, to repeal the health care overhaul, marking what the new Republican majority in the chamber hailed as the fulfillment of a campaign promise and the start of an all-out effort to dismantle <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per">President Obama</a>&#8217;s signature domestic policy achievement.</p>
<p>The House vote was the first stage of a Republican plan to use the party&#8217;s momentum coming out of the midterm elections to keep the White House on the defensive, and will be followed by a push to scale back federal spending. In response, the administration struck a more aggressive posture than it had during the campaign to sell the health care law to the public. With many House Democrats from swing districts having lost their seats in November, the remaining Democrats held overwhelmingly together in opposition to the repeal.</p>
<p>Knowing that a full-scale repeal would be blocked by the Senate and Mr. Obama, Republicans say they will try to withhold money that federal officials need to administer and enforce the law.</p>
<p>Republicans also intended to go after specific provisions, including requirements that many employers to offer insurance to employees or pay a tax penalty and that most Americans obtain <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">health insurance</a>.? Alternatively, Republicans say, they will try to prevent aggressive enforcement of the requirements by limiting money available to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/internal_revenue_service/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Internal Revenue Service</a>, which would collect the tax penalties.</p>
<p>The repeal effort is part of a multipronged systematic strategy that House Republican leaders say will include trying to cut off money for the law, summoning Obama administration officials to testify at investigative hearings and encouraging state officials to attack the law in court as unconstitutional. For House Republicans, a repeal vote would also be an important, if largely symbolic, opening salvo against the president, his party and his policy agenda.</p>
<p>Republicans denounced the law as an intrusion by the government that would prompt employers to eliminate jobs, create an unsustainable entitlement program, saddle states and the federal government with unmanageable costs, and interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. Republicans also said the law would exacerbate the steep rise in the cost of medical services.</p>
<p>For their part, the Obama administration and Democrats, who largely lost the health care message war in the raucous legislative process, see the renewed debate as a chance to show that the law will be a boon to millions of Americans and hope to turn &#8220;Obamacare&#8221; from a pejorative into a tag for one of the president&#8217;s proudest achievements. Democrats argue that repeal would increase the number of uninsured; put insurers back in control of health insurance, allowing them to increase premiums at will; and lead to explosive growth in the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">federal budget</a> deficit.</p>
<p>Republicans said their package would probably include proposals to allow sales of health insurance across state lines; to help small businesses band together and buy insurance; to limit damages in <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/malpractice/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">medical malpractice</a> suits; and to promote the use of health savings accounts, in combination with high-deductible insurance policies.</p>
<p>Republicans also want to help states expand insurance pools for people with serious illnesses. The new law includes such pools, as an interim step until broader insurance coverage provisions take effect in 2014, but enrollment has fallen short of expectations. They have also proposed allowing people to buy insurance across state lines and to join together in &#8220;association health plans,&#8221; sponsored by trade and professional groups.</p>
<p>But state insurance officials have resisted such proposals, on the ground that they would weaken state authority to regulate insurance and to enforce consumer protections &#8212; a concern shared by Congressional Democrats.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama has responded to criticism by saying he would be willing to amend portions of the law. On Feb. 28, 2011, he endorsed bipartisan legislation that would allow states to opt out earlier from a range of requirements, including the mandate, if they could demonstrate that other methods would allow them to cover as many people, with insurance that is as comprehensive and affordable, as provided by the new law. The changes must also not increase the federal deficit.</p>
<p>If states can meet those standards, they can ask to circumvent minimum benefit levels, structural requirements for insurance exchanges and the mandates that most individuals obtain coverage and that employers provide it. Washington would then help finance a state&#8217;s individualized health care system with federal money that would otherwise be spent there on insurance subsidies and tax credits.</p>
<p>Prospects for the proposal appear dim. Congress would have to approve the change through legislation, and House Republican leaders said that they were committed to repealing the law, not amending it. Even if the change were approved, it could be difficult for states to meet the federal requirements for the waivers.</p>
<p><strong>Court Challenges</strong></p>
<strong></strong>
<p>Immediately after Mr. Obama signed the bill, states began filing challenges to it in federal court. Twenty states,?led by Florida&#8217;s former attorney general, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/bill_mccollum/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Bill McCollum</a>, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for governor, banded together to file suit in federal district court in Pensacola, Fla. The first challenge was filed by the attorney general of Virginia.</p>
<p>In October 2010, a federal judge in Detroit <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/health/policy/08health.html?ref=health_care_reform">became the first to rul</a>e on the lawsuits, upholding the government&#8217;s position. The next month, a federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/health/policy/01lawsuit.html?ref=health_care_reform">did the same.</a></p>
<p>In December 2010, a federal judge in Richmond issued the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/policy/14health.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=print">first ruling against the law</a>, calling the individual mandate unconstitutional. The case centered on whether Congress had authority under the Commerce Clause to compel citizens to buy a commercial product &#8212; namely health insurance &#8212; in the name of regulating an interstate economic market. Plaintiffs in the lawsuits argued that there effectively would be no limits on federal power, and that the government could force people to buy American cars or, as the judge remarked at one hearing, &#8220;to eat asparagus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court&#8217;s position on the Commerce Clause has evolved through four signature cases over the last 68 years, with three decided since 1995. Two of the opinions established broad powers to regulate even personal commercial decisions that may influence a broader economic scheme. But other cases have limited regulation to &#8220;activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>A major question, therefore, has been whether the income tax penalties levied against those who do not obtain health insurance are designed to regulate &#8220;activity&#8221; or, as Virginia&#8217;s solicitor general, E. Duncan Getchell Jr., has argued, &#8220;inactivity&#8221; that is beyond Congress&#8217;s reach.</p>
<p>Justice Department lawyers responded that individuals cannot opt out of the medical market, and that the act of not obtaining insurance is an active decision to pay for health care out of pocket. They say that such decisions, taken in the aggregate, shift billions of dollars in uncompensated care costs to governments, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/hospitals/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">hospitals</a> and the privately insured.</p>
<p>In January 2011, a judge in Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., became the second to rule against the health care law. His ruling came in the most prominent of the more than 20 legal challenges mounted against some aspect of the sweeping health law. He declared the entire act void, including provisions that have already taken effect, like requirements that insurers cover children regardless of pre-existing conditions. Three other federal judges, meanwhile, have upheld the law.</p>
<p>In June 2011, a two-judge panel of the Appeals Court for the Sixth Circuit upheld the law, in what was the first of three appellate decisions.</p>
<p>In August 2011, a divided three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the so-called individual mandate, which is considered the centerpiece of the law, ruling that Congress exceeded its powers to regulate commerce when it decided to require people to buy health insurance. But the court held that while that provision was unconstitutional, the rest of the wide-ranging law could stand.</p>
<p>In September 2011, a federal appellate court in Richmond, Va., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/health/policy/09virginia.html">threw out a pair of cases</a> challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, ruling for varying reasons that the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to sue. In the process, two of the three judges on the panel volunteered that they would have upheld the law if they had been able to rule on the substance of the cases.</p>
<p>In November 2011, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/health/policy/appeals-court-upholds-health-care-law.html?scp=2&amp;sq=health%20care%20reform&amp;st=cse">a federal appeals court in Washington upheld the law </a>in a decision written by a prominent conservative jurist, Judge <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/laurence_h_silberman/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Laurence H. Silberman</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Supreme Court Steps In</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>On Sept. 28, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to review the decision from the 11th Circuit invalidating the mandate.?</p>
<p>In November 2011, the court?<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/us/supreme-court-to-hear-case-challenging-health-law.html?ref=global-home">agreed to hear a challenge to the law</a>. The court&#8217;s decision to step in had been expected, but the order answered many questions about just how the case would proceed. The court scheduled five and half hours of argument instead of the usual one, a testament to the importance of the case, which has as its center an epic clash between the federal government and the 26 states that together filed a challenge to the law.</p>
<p>In March 2012, the justices held a three-day hearing: two hours of arguments on whether Congress overstepped its constitutional authority, 90 minutes on whether the mandate may be severed from the balance of the law if Congress did go too far, and an hour each on the Medicaid and Anti-Injunction Act questions.</p>
<p>The court heard three appeals, two from challengers to the law and a third from the Obama administration. The appeal involving the 26 states is Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services, No. 11-400. A second challenge, from a business group and two individuals, is National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393. The federal government&#8217;s appeal is Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida, No. 11-398.</p>
<p><strong>Allowing Variations From State to State</strong></p>
<p>In a major surprise on the politically charged health care law, the Obama administration said on Dec. 16, 2011, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/health/policy/health-care-law-to-allow-states-to-pick-benefits.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Health%20Care%20Law%20Will%20Let%20States%20Tailor%20Benefits&amp;st=cse">that it would not define a single uniform set </a>of &#8220;essential health benefits&#8221; that must be provided by insurers for tens of millions of Americans. Instead, it will allow each state to specify the benefits within broad categories.</p>
<p>The move would allow significant variations in benefits from state to state, much like the current differences in state <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicaid</a> programs and the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/state_childrens_health_insurance_program_schip/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program</a>. By giving states the discretion to specify essential benefits, the Obama administration sought to deflect one of the most powerful arguments made by Republican critics of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per">President Obama</a>&#8217;s health care overhaul &#8212; that it was imposing a rigid, bureaucrat-controlled health system on Americans and threatening the quality of care. Opponents say that the federal government is forcing a one-size-fits-all standard for <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">health insurance</a> and usurping state authority to regulate the industry.</p>
<p>The new law lists 10 categories of &#8220;essential health benefits&#8221; that must be provided by insurance offered in the individual and small-group markets, starting in January 2014. These include preventive care, emergency services, maternity care, hospital and doctors&#8217; services and prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Over Birth Control??</strong></p>
<p>In February 2012, facing vocal opposition from religious leaders and an escalating political fight, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/health/policy/obama-addresses-ire-on-health-insurance-contraception-rule.html?ref=politics">the White House sought to ease mounting objections to a new administration rule</a> that would require <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">health insurance</a> plans &#8212; including those offered by Catholic universities and charities &#8212; to offer <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/specialtopic/birth-control-and-family-planning/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">birth control</a> to women free of charge.</p>
<p>As the Republican presidential candidates and conservative leaders sought to frame the rule as showing <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per">President Obama</a>&#8217;s insensitivity to religious beliefs, Mr. Obama&#8217;s aides promised to explore ways to make it more palatable to religious-affiliated institutions, perhaps by allowing some employers to make side insurance plans available that are not directly paid for by the institutions.</p>
<p>Speaker <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_a_boehner/index.html?inline=nyt-per">John A. Boehner</a> stepped into the battle, saying that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/us/politics/boehner-vows-to-fight-contraception-rule.html?hp">House Republicans would push legislation to challenge the policy</a>.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, introduced a sweeping amendment to the Obama legislation that would permit employers and insurers to refuse to provide or pay for coverage of &#8220;specific items or services&#8221; if the coverage would be &#8220;contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer or other entity offering the plan.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Uncertainty Over States and Medicaid Expansion</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that a huge expansion of Medicaid envisioned in the health care law was an option, not a mandate, for states. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/uncertainty-over-whether-states-will-choose-to-expand-medicaid.html?ref=us">One of the most important questions created by the court&#8217;s decision is whether states will take the option.</a></p>
<p>The Medicaid expansion is a central part of the law, accounting for roughly half of all the uninsured people expected to gain coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It estimates that 17 million uninsured people will gain coverage through Medicaid, at a cost to the federal government of $930 billion from 2014 to 2022.</p>
<p>While upholding the expansion of Medicaid, the Supreme Court limited the power of the federal government to secure compliance by penalizing states that refuse to go alongChief Justice Roberts said the federal government could not compel states to comply by cutting off all the federal money they receive for existing Medicaid programs. The threatened loss of so much federal money &#8212; more than 10 percent of state budgets &#8212; &#8220;is economic dragooning that leaves the states with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion,&#8221; the chief justice said. &#8220;A state could hardly anticipate that Congress&#8217;s reservation of the right to &#8216;alter&#8217; or &#8216;amend&#8217; the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief justice said Congress had put &#8220;a gun to the head&#8221; of states by requiring them to expand Medicaid or risk the loss of all federal Medicaid money. &#8220;States,&#8221; he said, &#8220;must have a genuine choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, the federal government and the states share Medicaid costs, with the federal government paying an average of 57 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Under the new law, the federal government will pay the full cost of covering those newly eligible for Medicaid for three years, from 2014 to 2016. The federal share will then gradually decline; it will be 90 percent, starting in 2020.</p>
<p>But many state officials worry that Congress will reduce the federal share and shift more costs to the states as it seeks ways to reduce the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">federal budget</a> deficit.</p>
<p>Republican critics are also mounting a challenge to President Obama&#8217;s interpretation of another important provision, under which the federal <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/us/critics-of-health-care-law-prepare-to-battle-over-insurance-exchange-subsidies.html?ref=us">government will subsidize health insurance</a>for millions of low- and middle-income people.</p>
<p>Starting in 2014, the law requires most Americans to have health insurance. It also offers subsidies to help people pay for insurance bought through markets known as insurance exchanges.?</p>
<p>At issue is whether the subsidies will be available in exchanges set up and run by the federal government in states that fail or refuse to establish their own exchanges.</p>
<p>Critics say the law allows subsidies only for people who obtain coverage through state-run exchanges. The White House says the law can be read to allow subsidies for people who get coverage in federal exchanges as well.</p>
<p>The law says that &#8220;each state shall&#8221; establish an exchange. But Washington could be running the exchanges in one-third to half of states, where local officials have been moving slowly or openly resisting the idea.</p>
<p>The dispute has huge practical implications. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 23 million uninsured people will gain coverage through exchanges and that all but five million of them will qualify for subsidies, averaging more than $6,000 a year per person. Subsidies, in the form of tax credits, will be available to people with incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount ($23,050 to $92,200 for a family of four).</p>
<p>Some supporters of the law say Congress may have made a mistake in drafting this section. But, they add, the intent of Congress is clear: subsidies should be available in federal as well as state exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>Bracing for a Shortage of Doctors</strong></p>
<p>With access to medical insurance being extended to tens of millions of people, the question becomes: Who will provide their care? The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that <a title="Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen With Health Law" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/health/policy/too-few-doctors-in-many-us-communities.html">in 2015 the country will have 62,900 fewer doctors than needed</a>. And that number will more than double by 2025, as the expansion of insurance coverage and the aging of baby boomers drive up demand for care. Even without the health care law, the shortfall of doctors in 2025 would still exceed 100,000.</p>
<p>Health experts, including many who support the law, say there is little that the government or the medical profession will be able to do to close the gap by 2014, when the law begins extending coverage to about 30 million Americans. It typically takes a decade to train a doctor.</p>
<p>Experts describe a doctor shortage as an &#8220;invisible problem.&#8221; Patients still get care, but the process is often slow and difficult.</p>
<p>Also, across the country, fewer than half of primary care clinicians were <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/72046.pdf">accepting new Medicaid patients</a> as of 2008, making it hard for the poor to find care even when they are eligible for Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid accounts for more than one-third of the overall growth in coverage in President Obama&#8217;s health care law.</p>
<p>Another major factor increasing demand &#8212; along with expansion of coverage in the law and simple population growth &#8212; is the aging of the baby boom generation. <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicare</a> officials predict that enrollment will surge to 73.2 million in 2025, up 44 percent from 50.7 million in 2012.</p>
<p>The pool of doctors has not kept pace, and will not, health experts said. Medical school enrollment is increasing, but not as fast as the population. The number of training positions for medical school graduates is lagging. Younger doctors are on average working fewer hours than their predecessors. And about a third of the country&#8217;s doctors are <a href="http://www.innovationlabs.com/pa_future/1/background_docs/AAMC%20Complexities%20of%20physician%20demand,%202008.pdf">55 or older</a>, and nearing retirement.</p>
<p>Physician compensation is also an issue. The proportion of medical students choosing to enter primary care has declined in the past 15 years, as average earnings for primary care doctors and specialists, like orthopedic surgeons and radiologists, have diverged. A study by the Medical Group Management Association <a href="http://www.mgma.com/blog/Highlights-of-MGMAs-2011-Physician-Compensation-survey">found that</a> in 2010, primary care doctors made about $200,000 a year. Specialists often made twice as much.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has sought to ease the shortage. The health care law increases Medicaid&#8217;s primary care payment rates in 2013 and 2014. It also includes money to train new primary care doctors, reward them for working in underserved communities and strengthen community health centers.</p>
<p>But the provisions within the law are expected to increase the number of primary care doctors by perhaps 3,000 in the coming decade. Communities around the country need about 45,000.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance Rebates Seen as Selling Point</strong></p>
<p><a title="Insurance Rebates Seen as Selling Point for Health Law" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/health/policy/insurance-rebates-seen-as-early-benefit-of-health-care-law.html?pagewanted=all">The health care law requires insurers to give out annual rebates</a> by Aug. 1, starting in 2012, if less than 80 percent of the premium dollars they collect go toward medical care. For insurers covering large employers, the threshold is 85 percent.</p>
<p>As a result, insurers will pay out $1.1 billion in 2012, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, with an average rebate of $151 per household. The highest average amounts are going to people in Vermont ($807 per family), Alaska ($622) and Alabama ($518). No rebates will be issued in New Mexico or Rhode Island, because all the insurers in those states met the 80/20 requirement.</p>
<p>Although the percentage of insurance companies that owe rebates in 2012 is relatively small, about 14 percent, many giants of the industry are on the list. They include Aetna, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthCare.</p>
<p>President Obama is highlighting the rebates as a tangible early benefit of the controversial legislation; on the day the Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional last month, he said millions of Americans would see rebates because their insurance companies had &#8220;spent too much on things like administrative costs and C.E.O. bonuses, and not enough on your health care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Self-insured employers, which cover more than half the nation&#8217;s workers, are exempt from the new rule, as are <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicare</a> and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicaid</a>. And of the 75 million people in health plans subject to the rule, only about 17 percent, or 12.8 million, will see a rebate in 2012, according to the Obama administration. Many who buy coverage directly from insurers are receiving checks. But in most cases rebates are being sent to employers, who can chose to put them toward future premium costs instead of distributing them to workers.</p>
<p>Still, the rebate provision could prove a potent selling point for a law that remains unpopular with many Americans, not to mention a well-timed tool for the Obama re-election campaign. Premiums &#8212; and anger toward insurance companies &#8212; keep rising: the cost of employer-sponsored family health plans jumped by nine percent in 2011 to more than $15,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
<p>Insurance companies say the rebate requirement does not address swiftly rising medical costs, which they say are the main reason premiums keep going up.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping Coverage Affordable for Workers With Families</strong></p>
<p>Although the new health care law is known as the Affordable Care Act, Democrats in Congress and advocates for low-income people say <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/us/ambiguity-in-health-law-could-make-family-coverage-too-costly.html">coverage may be unaffordable for millions of Americans because of a cramped reading of the law</a> by the administration and by the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/internal_revenue_service/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Internal Revenue Service</a> in particular.</p>
<p>Under rules proposed by the service, some working-class families would be unable to afford family coverage offered by their employers, and yet they would not qualify for subsidies provided by the law.</p>
<p>The fight revolves around how to define &#8220;affordable&#8221; under provisions of the law that are ambiguous. The definition could have huge practical consequences, affecting who gets help from the government in buying <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/health-insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>Under the law, most Americans will be required to have health insurance starting in 2014. Low- and middle-income people can get tax credits and other subsidies to help pay their premiums, unless they have access to affordable coverage from an employer.</p>
<p>The law specifies that employer-sponsored <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">insurance</a> is not affordable if a worker&#8217;s share of the premium is more than 9.5 percent of the worker&#8217;s household income. The I.R.S. says this calculation should be based solely on the cost of individual coverage for the employee, what the worker would pay for &#8220;self-only coverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Critics say the administration should also take account of the costs of covering a spouse and children because family coverage typically costs much more.</p>
<p>The I.R.S. issued final rules for the health insurance premium tax credit in May, but deferred its final decision on the affordability of family coverage.</p>
<p>The administration is trying to strike a balance. If the rules allow more people to qualify for subsidies, it would increase costs to the federal government. If the rules require employers to provide affordable coverage to dependents as well as workers, it would increase costs for many employers.</p>
<p>Some employers and members of Congress have suggested a possible compromise. The government would still look at the cost of &#8220;self-only coverage&#8221; in deciding whether insurance was affordable to an employee. If family coverage under the employer&#8217;s plan was too expensive, a family could get subsidies to buy insurance for dependents in the exchange, and the employer would not be penalized.</p>
