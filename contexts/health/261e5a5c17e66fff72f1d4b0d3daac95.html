						<div class="entry-bound">Hypomania. People haven’t generally heard of that word, but once they have, they want to know, what does bipolar hypomania feel like? This is a reasonable question with a completely unreasonable answer. What is Bipolar Hypomania? Hypomania can occur in many illnesses but it is a diagnostic feature of bipolar II. People with bipolar II experience hypomanias as opposed to the manias of bipolar I. I generally shortcut the definition and simply say that hypomania is like mania light.

<div class="entry-bound">The brain holds in mind what has just been seen by synchronizing brain waves in a working memory circuit, an animal study suggests. The more in-sync such electrical signals of neurons were in two key hubs of the circuit, the more those cells held the short-term memory of a just-seen object. The new findings may upturn prevailing theories about how working memory works.</div>

Budgets, including the military one, would be squeezed.

However, the same would very much apply to her rivals. Right now US power is being challenged across the globe and in some cases quite successfully. And what is fuelling those&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Letting go is hard. And it&#8217;s a challenge shared on an individual, cultural and societal level. It&#8217;s the reason why the need for change comes way before any change actually takes place. The fear of the unknown is often the culprit. The enemy we know seems more tolerable than the one we have yet to meet. What makes us finally let go of old ways of thinking, jobs that don&#8217;t serve us, friends that have outlived their stay, is that somewhere deep inside we know there is a better life for us. It&#8217;s a strand of hope that gives us the courage to walk the untraveled path.</div>

Researchers at Duke University and the Durham VA Medical Center say their study provides evidence that smaller amygdala volume is associated with PTSD, regardless of the severity of trauma.

Finally, both high cortisol and differences in brain activity predicted higher levels of anxiety at age 18. The males in the study did&hellip;</div>

Scientists have now performed one of the largest ever genetic replication studies of bipolar affective disorder, with 28,000 subjects recruited from 36 different research centers. Their findings provide compelling evidence that the chromosome 3p21.1 locus contains a common genetic risk for bipolar disorder, the PBRM1 gene.</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Lithium is a ‘gold standard’ drug for treating bipolar disorder, however not everyone responds in the same way. New research finds that this is true at the levels of gene activation, especially in the activation or repression of genes which alter the level the apoptosis (programmed cell death). Most notably BCL2, known to be important for the therapeutic effects of lithium, did not increase in non-responders. This can be tested in the blood of patients within four weeks of treatment.</div>

I repeatedly talk about how what works for me may not be appropriate for anyone else when I talk about healing. Well this extends out to our entire lives and spiritual pursuits too. This is the fundamental reason that coercion in psychiatry is wrong too. People all have their own way to find. And we know this deep within ourselves.

<div class="entry-bound">Hypomania. People haven’t generally heard of that word, but once they have, they want to know, what does bipolar hypomania feel like? This is a reasonable question with a completely unreasonable answer. What is Bipolar Hypomania? Hypomania can occur in many illnesses but it is a diagnostic feature of bipolar II. People with bipolar II experience hypomanias as opposed to the manias of bipolar I. I generally shortcut the definition and simply say that hypomania is like mania light. Bipolar hypomania is not life-threatening by definition. Mania, on the other hand, is. In fact, to me hypomanias&hellip;</div>

Although most of us are quite skeptical about how happy or not money can make us. The research is quite clear that, up to a point money is not the answer to happiness. But psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley suggest that a little R.E.S.P.E.C.T might be the answer!

<div class="entry-bound">Rebound relationships can be quite intense. It&#8217;s often the case that the longer the previous relationship, the more intense the rebound. Why does this happen?
