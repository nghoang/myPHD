        <h1><a name="skip"></a>Welcome to the Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre Website</h1>

        <p>Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres are information centres for older people, 
          people with disabilities and those who provide care and services. Centres 
          provide free and confidential information on community aged care, disability 
          and other support services available locally, interstate or anywhere 
          within Australia.</p>
        <p> The network of 54 Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres has around 
		  65 'walk-in' shopfronts throughout Australia. 
		  Many shopfronts are conveniently located near, or within, shopping centres.</p>
        <p> You can contact your nearest Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre by phoning 
          a national telephone number Freecall&#8482; <strong>1800 052 222*</strong>. 
          Anyone can contact a Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre and to date Centres 
          have assisted over 500,000 people.</p>
        <p> When you contact a Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre the staff at the Centre
		  will discuss your situation with you, and give you information about the local services available
		  or those you may benefit from. However, if you would like to search for services in your area yourself you can 
          use our <a href="/ccsd/usr_general/gen_home.cfm">online 
          search facility</a>.</p>

        <h2><a name="1"></a>How can a Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre help me?</h2>
        <p>There are a wide range of services to support independent living in 
          the community, but finding out about them or accessing them can be time 
          consuming, difficult and confusing. Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres provide 
          a single point of contact for the general public, service providers, 
		  general practitioners and other health professionals for information
		  on community, aged and disability services and carer support. 
          The Centres can also assist with information about costs for services, 
          assessment processes and eligibility criteria.</p>
        <p>Each Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre has extensive regional networks and 
          maintains a comprehensive database containing community aged care, disability 
          and other support services. Shopfronts are operated by organisations 
          that already provide established services within their region. Their 
          extensive local knowledge ensures they provide a quality service. This 
          regional focus enables each Centre to develop an awareness of the entire 
          range of services available, to establish networks with local providers 
          and ensure information is up to date.</p>
		<p>The Centres can also help arrange respite, when carers need to take a break from caring.
		They do this by acting as a single contact point for information need by carers and by organising,
		purchasing, or managing respite care assistance packages for carers. Examples of respite care assistance
		include in-home respite care; support workers to assist you when you are taking a break away from home; and
		residential respite care.</p>
        <h2> <a name="2"></a>What information can I get?</h2>
        <p>If you require information outside your local area, Centre staff can 
          link you to other Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres around Australia and 
          they in turn will provide accurate information about services in their 
          local area. The network of Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres can provide 
          information on services available in every town and city in Australia.</p>
        <p>Centres provide information on many types of assistance, from personal 
          care and domestic help to accommodation in nursing homes and hostels. 
          Your local Centre can also let you know which services are available 
          in your area. All information is free of charge and provided in confidence.</p>
        <p>Information is available in 17 community languages other than English 
          and information is available for Indigenous and vision impaired clients.</p>
        <h2><a name="3"></a>How to contact my nearest Centre?</h2>

        <h2> <a name="4"></a>Who operates Centres?</h2>
        <p>Shopfronts are operated by organisations that already provide services 
          in their region. The wide range of organisations includes community 
          based, religious, charitable, private, and local and State government 
          providers.</p>
        <p>Every Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centre operator provides a walk-in shopfront, 
          where anyone is able to walk in and seek the information they require 
          face-to-face. If you find it more convenient, you may phone the Centre 
          on Freecall&#8482; <strong>1800 052 222*</strong>, or search the services 
          database online. </p>
