<div class="entry-bound">You&#039;re at a big group dinner and it&#039;s time to pay up, to divide the total and multiply a certain percentage for the tip. How many people tense up and say something like, &#034;Oh, I&#039;m so bad at math&#034;? Fear of math is everywhere - in the adult world where there aren&#039;t official pop quizzes, and in schools where the next generation of scientific problem-solvers are struggling with homework. Researchers report in a new study in the journal PLoS One that this anxiety about mathematics triggers the same brain activity that&#039;s linked with the physical sensation of pain.</div>

<div class="entry-bound">For years, pregnant women who suffer from depression have been told it&#039;s safer for them and their unborn child to continue taking antidepressants during pregnancy. Now a new study is challenging that advice, suggesting the opposite is true and advocating against most women taking these drugs. If the depression is severe, however, the benefits might outweigh the risks, so it&#039;s best to check with your psychiatrist or physician. Experts say about 13% of women take an antidepressant at some point during their pregnancy. Many drugs are called SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Mayor Bloomberg let everyone know today that the NYC Marathon planned for this Sunday, 11/4, has been cancelled. A bit late notice, if you ask me, but the right choice nonetheless. Bottom line for those who were planning to race - (1) guaranteed entry for next year, (2) your $200 entry fee is basically a donation to Hurricane Sandy victims now so try and feel good about that, and (3) you can donate your unused hotel rooms to hurricane victims if interested.

The new format would have runners swimming ~1000 yards at mile 4 in Brooklyn, as well as at mile 25 at 59th street near the finish.

<div class="entry-bound">Self-harm is common among young people. Many have at one time scratched, punctured or cut themselves or hit their head forcefully against a wall, and the behaviour is almost as common among boys as girls. However, it may not be appropriate to compare young people who self-harm and adult psychiatric patients who self-harm. Knowledge is needed in order not to over-interpret the behaviour of the young people, according to psychologist Jonas Bjärehed, who has recently presented his thesis at Lund University in Sweden.</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Brain aneurysms occur in about six percent of the population. They are dilated sections of blood vessels, which can deteriorate over time until the blood vessel wall ruptures, resulting in a haemorrhage. This causes a loss of mental functions and severe headaches. Haemorrhages of this kind can even be life threatening. The treatment of such patients involves complex medical decision-making. The models developed by Julia Mikhal can be of great use in this regard.</div>

"When you recognize that failing doesn't make you a failure, you give yourself permission to try all sorts of things." ~Lauren Fleshman, American track and field athlete We are so darn hard on ourselves. We start our day thinking we're going to fail and therefore there's no point in trying. Sometimes we just don't bother to give ourselves a break. Why?  It's something we just do to ourselves. So how do we stop the cycle of negative I cant's? Well I think one way is to begin by changing those pesky words in our minds.  Start saying I can but don't set a time limit.</div>

Humans only mix their genes when they produce offspring, but bacteria regularly exchange genes. This ability is a contributor to the rapid pace of bacterial evolution. When a bacterial strain develops a new way to beat antibiotics, it can share the strategy not only with its descendants but also with other bacteria.

Today&#8217;s big news is that Joan Smalls tweeted her workout&#8217;s calorie burn, in friendly competition with fellow Victoria&#8217;s Secret model Andreea Diaconu, earning eyerolls over on Buzzfeed&#8230;but in her defense, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s really so bad.

<div class="entry-bound">Unless you own a commercial property with a pool you may have missed one of the bigger news stories regarding accessibility laws for the disabled that has been going on for more than a year now. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (signed into law by George H.W. Bush&#8230;yes, that&#8217;s the speed at which things get implemented) many public and commercial entities with pools and hot tubs will be required to add a pool lift or an alternate sloped entry to provide access to people with disabilities.

<div class="entry-bound">An interesting article appeared recently which talked about how interviewees are ill-prepared for interviewers, according to employers. The article highlighted some interesting statistics produced after a survey was carried out by Hays Ireland recruitment in order to find out what had tactics had changed for job hunters, if any. The results were a bit thought provoking. While 58% of job hunters are saying they put more time into interview preparation, only 16% of employers are seeing the improvement. So, is the extra work just not showing, are people doing their prep wrong, or are they just&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">I&#8217;m dying. Of laughter, that is. I came across the Huffington Post article about the 8-year-old girl who wrote a letter to Mitt Romney after she watched the debate and heard him talk about his desire to cut PBS funding. The letter is brilliant. Understandably, she is a Sesame Street fan and very upset about his comments. She tells him not to cut funding and says &#8220;You find something else to cut off.&#8221; (I&#8217;ll let your imaginations run wild here). She&#8217;s so cute and sincere, I just love it.

Prior to jumping into the details on the highly anticipated collaboration with Deadmau5, here&#8217;s some background on the musician who is quickly taking the electronica music world by storm. The UK based singer/songwriter/musician got her start when she signed a record deal at the mere age of 18. Soon afterwards, her first album entitled &#8220;iMegaphone&#8221; was released.

<div class="entry-bound">At first the question seems preposterous. How could a global recession possibly enhance and bolster US power? After all, it would create huge problems with the economy. Budgets, including the military one, would be squeezed. The banking system would be under strain and politicians would be forced to focus more on the home front as people lost their jobs and their homes. America just wouldn’t walk so tall in the world. However, the same would very much apply to her rivals. Right now US power is being challenged across the globe and in some cases quite successfully. And what is fuelling those&hellip;</div>

The pre-recorded phone calls that come right as we sit down to dinner, the flyers littering our mailboxes, and ads with ominous drumbeats whenever we turn on the television—it's easy to get more than a little sick of politics. But as we also know, the elected officials on all of those flyers, calls and advertisements are going to decide some pretty critical issues. Like protecting us from toxic chemicals. And so, to that end, we've come up with a little campaign literature of our own: Safer States' guide to toxic chemicals, health, and&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Shedding the pounds is all about having common sense. Losing weight is about burning more calories than you take in. Therefore, common sense dictates that if you want to lose weight and kept it off you will need to do a few things. The few things that you will need to do are… You will need to get off the sofa and increase your activity level. You will need to start eating smaller portions. You will need to start eating healthier foods. You will need to have a better attitude towards shedding the pounds. You will need to quit giving excuses for not losing weight and replace them with reasons&hellip;</div>

However, if people truly realized what losing weight could do for them, they would be willing to do it. I lost 50 pounds in four months over six years ago, and I can truly say that my weight loss results were worth the investment. I am just a few weeks away from my 50th birthday, and I am in great shape (for an old guy). This is what losing weight has done for me… I have been told countless times recently that I look like I am 35 years old, not 50. I attribute it to being thinner and in shape. My blood&hellip;</div>

If you don’t like to exercise, it is because you have not tried to find one that you like. It just takes a little effort and a bit of time.

Well, it&#8217;s more than likely because most of us have went on the wrong type of program and have read stories of others that have went on the wrong type of program, and this unfortunately has embedded a picture in minds that all diets are worthless.</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Hi Nancy,Thank you so much for adding your feedback. As you likely saw, I could not figure out the &quot;right&quot; way to use the salve and wound up trying several appropaches. I can certainly testify that it works, but I sure would have loved to get it all out in one fell swoop as you seemed to. :-)One thing this journey has shown me is that there are lots of ways to tackle cancer. I pray that you remain cancer-free.God Bless!</div>

In order for these students to become doctors, they must complete a compulsory registration year – an internship. Due to a shortfall, 182 students have currently not received jobs. Local students are prioritised, so those missing out are international students who have spent the past 4-6 years in Australia and received the same training as their domestic colleagues. There is plenty of work for these graduates but the state and federal governments need to commit money to fund these jobs.</div>

Many are currently housed in residential aged care facilities where families assume they are getting appropriate care. But our studies suggest that while their physical needs are being attended to, their psychological needs are being overlooked.

There is a strong correlation between my rosacea breakouts and stress and it seems to be the more important than the food I eat and all other aspects.
