									<h2>Background</h2>
									<div class="left">
																					<p>Good health brings many benefits, including enhanced access to education and the job market, an increase in productivity and wealth, reduced health care costs, good social relations, and of course, a longer life.</p>
<p><em>Life Expectancy</em></p>
<p>Life expectancy is the most widely used measure of health, although it only takes into account the length of people’s life and not their quality of life. There have been remarkable gains in life expectancy over the past fifty years in OECD countries. On average, <strong>life expectancy at birth reached 80 years in 2010,</strong> a gain of more than 10 years since 1960.<strong> Women live almost six years older than men, averaging 83 years versus 77 years for men in 2010</strong>. The OECD country with the highest life expectancy is Japan, with average life expectancy of 83 years. At the other end of the scale, life expectancy is the lowest in Turkey and Hungary, both at 74 years. Life expectancy in the Russian Federation was 69 years, and in Brazil 73 years in 2010.</p>
<p>Recent OECD analysis suggests that health care spending growth has contributed to the improvement in life expectancy, but other determinants such as rising living standards, environmental improvements, lifestyle changes and education are also important drivers. Taken together, these explain much of the cross-country differences in life expectancy, as well as changes over time. Further progress in population health status and life expectancy can be achieved by putting greater emphasis on public health and disease prevention especially among disadvantaged groups, and improving the quality and performance of health care systems.</p>
<p>Chronic (non-communicable) diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory conditions and diabetes, are now the main causes of disability and death in OECD countries. In 2010, chronic diseases caused around three-quarters of all deaths in OECD countries. Many of these diseases are preventable, since they are linked to modifiable lifestyles. People who do not smoke, drink alcohol in moderate quantities, are physically active, eat a balanced diet, and who are not overweight or obese have a much lower risk of early death than those who have unhealthy habits.</p>
<p>A number of OECD countries have achieved remarkable progress in reducing tobacco consumption over the past few decades. However, it is still a leading cause of early death and it remains the largest avoidable risk to health. Much of the decline in tobacco consumption can be attributed to public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. Less than 20% of adults in 15 OECD countries now smoke daily, down from over 30% in 1980. Only 14% of adults in Sweden and Iceland reported smoking daily in 2010. Tobacco consumption remains high in certain countries such as Greece where 32% of adults continue to smoke on a daily basis.</p>																			</div>
									<div class="right">
																					<p>Overweight and obesity is another important risk factor for many chronic diseases. <strong>In 21 of the 34 OECD countries, more than 50% of the adult population is now defined as being overweight or obese.</strong> The prevalence of obesity, which presents more health risks than being overweight, varies from 4% in Japan and Korea to 30% or over in Mexico and the United States. The <strong>rate of obesity has more than doubled over the past 20 years in a number of OECD countries.</strong> Governments in many OECD countries have introduced policies to combat obesity through promoting more balanced diets and physical activity. Often these initiatives are aimed at school-age children, by changing the school environment and canteen menus, as well as including health and lifestyle education in the curriculum. Other initiatives include encouraging physicians to provide appropriate counselling for at-risk patients, strengthening food labelling and advertising regulations, and fiscal measures to tax unhealthy foods and reduce taxes on healthy foods.</p>
<p><em>Self-Reported Health</em></p>
<p>Most OECD countries conduct regular health surveys which allow respondents to report on different aspects of their health. The commonly-asked question, "How is your health?” is one way of collecting data on self-perceived health status. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers received have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use. Across the OECD, <strong>about 70% of the adult population say their health is ‘good’ or ‘very good’.</strong> In New Zealand and the United States, 90% of adults report being in good health; while in Japan, Korea and Portugal less than 50% of people rate their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’. Cultural factors may affect responses to this broad question on health status.</p>
<p>Men are more likely to report good health than women, with an <strong>OECD average of 72% of men saying their health is ‘good’ or ‘very good’ compared with 67% for women.</strong> The gap is largest in Chile, Portugal and Turkey. In Australia, Canada and New Zealand, male and female rates are similar, and in Finland more women than men report being in good health. Age and social status also have an impact on answers. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. In 2010, <strong>about 80% of the top 20% of the adult population across OECD countries rated their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 60% for the bottom 20%.</strong></p>																			</div>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, <strong>life expectancy at birth in Australia stood at almost 82 years,</strong> two years higher than the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy <strong>for women is 84 years, compared with 80 for men, slightly lower than the average OECD gender gap of six years, with women living 83 years and men 77.</strong></p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors have an impact on life expectancy. Total <strong>health spending accounted for 8.7% of GDP in Australia</strong> in 2008, lower than the average of 9.6% in OECD countries. However, Australia ranks above the OECD average in terms of total health spending per person.</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. Australia provides an example of a country that has achieved remarkable progress in reducing tobacco consumption, cutting by more than half the percentage of adults who smoke daily from 35.4% in 1983 to 15.1% in 2010. The smoking rate among adults in Australia is now one of the lowest in the OECD, equal to the United States and behind only Sweden and Iceland. Much of the decline in Australia can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation.</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Obesity rates are high in Australia, and they have been increasing faster than in most other OECD countries over the last 20 years. Some <strong>60% of adults in Australia are overweight or obese.</strong> Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma, and higher health care costs in the future.</p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>85% of people in Australia</strong> <strong>said they were in good health,</strong> higher than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use. Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In Australia, however, the difference is small, with <strong>85% of positive answers for women and 84% for men</strong>. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. <strong>About 93% of the top 20% of the adult population in Australia rates their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 75% for the bottom 20%.</strong></p>

<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010,<strong> life expectancy at birth in Austria stood at almost 81 years,</strong> one year above the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy<strong> for women is 84 years, compared with 78 for men, in line with the average OECD gender gap of six years, with women living 83 years and men 77.</strong></p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). Total <strong>health spending accounted for 11% of GDP in Austria in 2009,</strong> more than one percentage point higher than the OECD average of 9.6%. Austria also spends more on health per person than the average in OECD countries, with spending of 3 970 USD in 2008, compared with an OECD average of 3 060 USD. Health spending per person in Austria increased by 2.3% per year on average between 2000 and 2008, among the smallest increases across all OECD countries during this period.</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. Smoking rates among adults in Austria stand at 23.2%, close to the OECD average of 23.3%. In many OECD countries, large proportions of the population are overweight or obese. On average, 17% of the OECD population is obese. In Austria, t<strong>he obesity rate among adults was 12.4% in 2006</strong> . Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” 6<strong>9% of people in Austria reported to be in good health</strong>, close to the OECD average of 70%.

<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, l<strong>ife expectancy at birth for the whole population in Belgium stood at just over 80 years</strong>, close to the OECD average of 80 years.<strong> Life expectancy for women is 83 years, compared with 78 for men, slightly lower than the average OECD gender gap of six years, with women living 83 years and men 77.</strong></p>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. I<strong>n 2008, life expectancy at birth in Canada stood at 81 years,</strong> slightly above the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy <strong>for women is 83 years, compared with 78.5,</strong> close to the OECD average gender gap of six years with life expectancy of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 11.4% of GDP in Canada in 2009,</strong> nearly two percentage points higher than the OECD average of 9.7%. Canada also ranks above the OECD average in terms of total health spending per person, with spending of 4 079 USD in 2008 compared with an OECD average of 3 060 USD. Between 2000 and 2008, health spending per person in Canada increased in real terms by 3.4% per year on average, a growth rate lower than the OECD average (4.2% per year). In Canada, 70.2% of health spending was funded by public sources in 2008, below the average of 72.8% in OECD countries.</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. Canada provides an example of a country that has achieved remarkable progress in reducing tobacco consumption, with the rate of daily smokers among adults having been cut by nearly half since 1980 (from 34% in 1980 to 17.5% in 2008) and now lower than the OECD average of 23.3%. Much of this decline in Canada, as well as in other countries, can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation.</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>In many OECD countries, large proportions of the population are overweight or obese. On average,<strong> 17% of the population is obese in the OECD</strong>. In Canada, the obesity rate among adults was 24.2% in 2008 . Two out of 3 men are overweight and 1 in 4 people are obese in Canada, but the rate of increase has been one of the slowest in the OECD. Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?”<strong> 88% of people in Canada reported to be in good health</strong>, higher than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of <strong>72% for men and 67% for women</strong>. In Canada, there is no difference between men and women with 88% of positive answers. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. In 2009, about <strong>94% of the top 20% of the adult population in Canada rated their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 78% for the bottom 20%</strong></p>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, <strong>life expectancy at birth in Germany stood at almost 81 years,</strong> close to the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy for <strong>women is 83 years, compared with 78 for men,</strong> close to the OECD average by gender of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 11.6% of GDP in Germany in 2009,</strong> almost 2 percentage points higher than the average of 9.7% in OECD countries. Only the United States (16%), France (11.2%) and Switzerland (10.7%) allocated more of their GDP to health than Germany in 2008. On the other hand, Germany ranks only 9th among OECD countries in health spending per person, with spending of 3 737 USD per person in 2008. The OECD average in 2008 was 3 060 USD per person. </p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. Smoking rates among adults in Germany have decreased from 28.5% in 1978 to 23.2% in 2005, a rate that is roughly equal to the current OECD average. <strong>The obesity rate among adults is of 14.7% in Germany.</strong>  Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>																							</div>

Health spending per person in Hungary grew, in real terms, by an average of 4.0% per year between 2000 and 2008. This growth rate was just under the OECD average of 4.2% per year. The strong rise in pharmaceutical spending has been one of the factors behind the rise in total health spending in Hungary as well as in many other OECD countries.

Life expectancy for <strong>women is 85 years, compared with 79 for men,</strong> and close to the OECD gender gap of six years with a life expectancy of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounts for 9.5% of GDP in Italy,</strong> slightly below the OECD average of 9.7%. Italy ranks below the OECD average in terms of health spending per person, spending 2870 USD compared with an OECD average of 3060 USD. Between 2000 and 2008, health spending per person in Italy increased, in real terms, by 1.9% per year on average, a growth rate much lower than the OECD average of 4.2% per year.</p>																							</div>

																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. Italy has achieved some progress in reducing tobacco consumption, with current rates of daily smokers among adults standing at 22.4%, down from 27.8% in 1990. Smoking rates in Italy are now slightly lower than the OECD average of 23.3%. <strong>Obesity rates are low in Italy, relative to most OECD countries, but are very high among children.</strong> 1 in 3 children is overweight, one of the highest rates in the OECD. About 1 in 10 people is obese, significantly less than the OECD average of 1 in 6. Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>67% of people in Italy reported to be in good health,</strong> slightly lower than the OECD average of 70%.

On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of <strong>72% for men and 67% for women.</strong> In Italy, the average is 70% for men and 63% for women. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income.

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, <strong>Japan enjoyed the highest life expectancy among OECD countries, at 83 years</strong>. Life expectancy for <strong>women is 86 years, compared with 80 for men</strong>, in line with the average OECD gender gap of six years with life expectancy of 83 years for women and 77 for men. </p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors).<strong> Total health spending accounted for 8.5% of GDP in Japan in 2008,</strong> more than one percentage point lower than the OECD average of 9.7% . Japan also ranks below the OECD average in terms of health spending per person, with spending of 2729 USD in 2007, compared with an OECD average of 3060 USD in 2008. Health spending per person in Japan rose, in real terms, by 2.2% between 2000 and 2007, a growth rate lower than the OECD average of 4.2% for 2000–2008. </p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. In Japan, 26% of adults report smoking every day, compared with an OECD average of 23%. Male smoking rates, at 40%, remain particularly high in Japan. However, at just 3.4% of the general population, <strong>Japan has the lowest rate of obesity in the OECD.</strong> </p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>30% of people in Japan reported to be in good health,</strong> much lower than the OECD average of 70%.

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. Among OECD countries, Korea registered the greatest gain in life expectancy between 1960 and 2008, with an overall increase in longevity of 28 years, rapidly closing the gap with the average across OECD countries. In 1960, <strong>life expectancy in Korea was 16 years below the OECD average. By 2010, it stood at nearly 81 years,</strong> above the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy for <strong>women is 84 years, compared with 77 for men,</strong> close to the OECD average with a life expectancy of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 6.9% of GDP in Korea,</strong> nearly 3 points lower than the OECD average of 9.7%. Health spending tends to rise with income, and generally OECD countries with higher GDP per person also tend to spend more on health. It is not surprising, therefore, that Korea also ranks below the OECD average in terms of health expenditure per person, with spending of 1801 USD in 2008, compared with an OECD average of 3060 USD.</p>
<p>Health expenditure per person has, nonetheless, increased rapidly in Korea since the second half of the 1980s when the national health insurance was established. During the 1990s, the rate of growth in health spending has been two-times greater than the average across OECD countries. This trend continued between 2000 and 2008, when <strong>the growth rate in health spending in Korea reached 8.0% per year,</strong> compared with an OECD average of 4.2%. This was the second highest growth rate in OECD countries, after the Slovak Republic. The increase in health spending in Korea over the past decade or so has been driven mainly by a rapid rise in public spending on health, especially in the purchase of pharmaceuticals.</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. In Korea, there remains a huge gender gap in smoking rates between men and women: 44.7% of Korean men reports smoking every day, the second highest rate across all OECD countries after Greece, compared with only 7.2% of women, the lowest rate. Across the OECD, on average 23% of people smoke.</p>
<p>Obesity rates in Korea are among the lowest in the OECD, but have been increasing steadily. <strong>About 4% of the adult population is obese in Korea and about 30% are overweight (including obese).</strong> Furthermore, large socio-economic disparities in obesity exist in women in Korea. Women with poor education are 5 times more likely than more educated women to be overweight. Virtually no disparities exist between men of different educational levels. OECD projections indicate that overweight rates will increase by a further 5% within ten years. The average for the 21 OECD countries with self-reported data was 14.9% in 2008. Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>38% of people in Korea reported to be in good health,</strong> much lower than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In Korea,<strong> the average is 42% for men and 34% for women</strong>. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. In 2010, a<strong>bout 42% of the top 20% of the adult population in Korea rated their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 34% for the bottom 20%</strong>.</p>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In particular, Mexico has seen dramatic improvements in life expectancy (of more than 17 years) and a steady decline in infant mortality rates. Nonetheless, at <strong>76 years in 2010, </strong>life expectancy remains four years lower than the OECD average and the fourth lowest in the OECD. Life expectancy for<strong> women is 78 years, compared with 73 for men</strong> and compared with an OECD average of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounts for 6.4% of GDP in Mexico</strong>, more than three percentage points lower than the average of 9.7% in OECD countries. Although public spending on health in Mexico has more than doubled since 1995, it remains low by international standards. Additionally, Mexico’s health indicators lag behind those of most OECD countries.</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, excessive weight gain remains an important risk factor for many chronic diseases. Obesity rates have increased in recent decades in all OECD countries, although with <strong>30% of the adult Mexican population reported as obese,</strong> Mexico is second only to the US and much higher than the OECD average of 17%. </p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>66% of people in Mexico reported to be in good health,</strong> lower than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In Mexico, the <strong>average is 67% for men and 64% for women</strong>. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income.</p>
<h2>Better Policies for Better Lives</h2>
<p><em>Improved health coverage with Seguro Popular</em></p>
<p>One third of the population, mostly in low-income groups, has no health insurance. The uninsured are less likely to receive appropriate preventive care and timely treatment when sick, which results in higher spending, often out-of-pocket, and worse outcomes. The government is aiming for universal health coverage in 2011 by further expanding Seguro Popular, a program that provides financial assistance to low-income families and has been successful in increasing coverage by about 25% of the population since 2004.</p>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, <strong>life expectancy at birth for the whole population in Norway stood at 81 years,</strong> above the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy for<strong> women is 83 years, compared with 79 for men,</strong> and compared with an OECD average of 83 for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 9.6% of GDP in Norway in 2009,</strong> compared with an average of 9.7% across OECD countries. In terms of health spending per person, Norway ranked the second highest among OECD countries in 2008 (after the United States), with spending of 5003 USD, well above the OECD average of 3060 USD. Health spending per person in Norway increased, in real terms, by 1.7% per year on average between 2000 and 2008, the second lowest growth rate of all OECD countries, and well below the OECD average (4.2%).</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. In Norway, the proportion of smokers among adults has been reduced from 36% in 1980 to 21% in 2008, slightly below the OECD average of 23%. Much of this decline can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. In Norway,<strong> the obesity rate among adults is 10.0%</strong>. </p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>80% of people in Norway reported to be in good health,</strong> higher than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In Norway, the average is <strong>82% for men and 78% for women</strong>. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income.</p>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, l<strong>ife expectancy at birth in Poland stood at 76 years</strong>, below the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy <strong>for women is 81 years, compared with 72 for men,</strong> and compared with an OECD average of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors)<strong>. Total health spending accounted for 7.4% of GDP in Poland in 2009,</strong> more than two percentage points lower than the OECD average of 9.7%. Poland also ranks below the OECD average in terms of health spending per person, with spending of 1213 USD in 2008, compared with an OECD average of 3060 USD in 2008. Only Chile, Mexico and Turkey had lower per person spending. Health spending per person in Poland grew, in real terms, by an average of 7.4% per year between 2000 and 2008. This growth rate was well above the OECD average of 4.2% per year. </p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. While the percentage of adults who smoke every day has declined markedly in Poland from 41.5% in 1992 to 26.3% in 2004 (latest year available), it remains above the OECD average (23.3% in 2008)<strong>. The obesity rate among adults is of 12.5%</strong>. </p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>58% of people in Poland reported to be in good health,</strong> lower than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In Poland, the average is <strong>62% for men and 55% for women</strong>. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. In 2010, about <strong>70% of the top 20% of the adult population in Poland rated their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 53% for the bottom 20%.</strong></p>

<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 10.1% of GDP in Portugal in 2008,</strong> more than the OECD average of 9.7%. Despite spending a high proportion of its GDP on health, Portugal spent only 2,151 USD on health per person in 2006, a lower figure than the OECD average of 3,060 USD in 2008. The United States spent, by far, the most on health per person in 2007 (7,538 USD), followed by Norway and Switzerland (with spending of over 4,600 USD per person).</p>																							</div>

<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, <strong>life expectancy at birth in the Slovak Republic stood at 75 years,</strong> below the OECD average of 80 years.  <strong>Life expectancy for women is 79 years, compared with 72 for men,</strong> and compared with an OECD average of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 9.1% of GDP in the Slovak Republic in 2009,</strong> lower than the OECD average of 9.7%. The Slovak Republic also ranks well below the OECD average in terms of total health spending per person, with spending of 1738 USD in 2008, compared with an OECD average of 3060 USD. Countries with high health spending per person include the United States (which spent 7538 USD per person in 2008), Norway and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Health spending per person in the Slovak Republic grew, in real terms, by an average of 11.0% per year between 2000 and 2008. This was the fastest growth rate of all OECD countries during this period, and was significantly higher than the OECD average of 4.2% per year. The strong rise in pharmaceutical spending has been one of the factors behind <strong>the rise in total health spending, accounting for 28.1% of total health spending in 2008</strong>, well above the OECD average of 17.1%.</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. The daily smoking rate among adults in the Slovak Republic was 25.0% of the adult population in 2006—slightly above the OECD average of 23.3% in 2008. <strong>The obesity rate among adults - based on actual measures of height and weight - was 16.9% in 2008.</strong> This is much lower than the obesity rate in the United States (33.8% in 2008) and significantly lower also than the rate in the United Kingdom (24.5% in 2008). The average for the 13 OECD countries with measured data was 21.0% in 2008. The average for the 21 OECD countries with self-reported data was 14.9% in 2008.Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010, <strong>life expectancy at birth for the whole population in Sweden stood at 82 years</strong>, above the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy for women is 84 years, compared with 80 for men, close to the OECD average of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 10.0% of GDP</strong> in Sweden in 2009, which was above the OECD average of 9.7%. The United States is, by far, the country that spends the most on health as a share of its economy (with 16.0% of its GDP allocated to health in 2008), followed by France (11.2%) and Switzerland (10.7%). <strong>Sweden also spends more on health per person than many OECD countries, with spending of 3470 USD</strong> in 2008, compared with an OECD average of 3060 USD. Countries with the highest health expenditure per person in 2008 were the United States (which spent 7538 USD per person), followed by Norway and Switzerland (with spending over 4600 USD).</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. <strong>The proportion of daily smokers in Sweden has been reduced from 32.4% in 1980 to 14.5% in 2006</strong>, the lowest rate among OECD countries, and well below the average of 23.3%. Much of this decline can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. Obesity rates in Sweden are low relative to most OECD countries. One person in ten is obese in Sweden, but more than half of men and one third of women are overweight. Large social disparities exist in both men and women in Sweden. Women with poor education are more than twice as likely to be overweight than more educated women to be overweight. For men, the gap is less pronounced, but it is larger than in most OECD countries. Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>

																									<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” 7<strong>9% of people in Sweden reported to be in good health</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In Sweden, the average is 81% for men and 77% for women. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. In 2010, about 89% of the top 20% of the adult population in Sweden rated their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 82% for the bottom 20%.</p>

In 2010,<strong> life expectancy at birth for the whole population in Switzerland stood at 83 years</strong>, above the OECD average of 80 years.

Much of this decline can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. The obesity rate among adults - based on self-reported height and weight – grew from 5.4% in 1992 to 8.1% in 2007. Still, this figure is much lower than the OECD self-reported average of 14.9% in 2008.

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. Among OECD countries, Turkey registered one of the greatest gains in life expectancy between 1960 and 2008, with an overall increase in longevity of 25 years, rapidly narrowing the gap with the average across OECD countries. In 2010, <strong>life expectancy at birth for the whole population in Turkey stood at 74 years</strong>, below the OECD average of 80 years. Life expectancy for women is 77 years, compared with 72 for men, lower than the average OECD gap of 6 years</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 6.1% of GDP in Turkey</strong> in 2008, below the average of 9.7% across OECD countries in 2008. Health spending tends to rise with income: in general, OECD countries with higher GDP per person tend to spend more on health. Given that Turkey has the lowest GDP per person among OECD countries,<strong> it is not surprising that it also spends the least per person, at 767 USD</strong> in 2007. This compares with an OECD average of 3060 USD in 2008.</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Turkey has achieved some progress in reducing tobacco consumption, with <strong>the proportion of daily smokers among adults decreasing from 43.6% in 1989 to 27.4% in 2008</strong>. Still, smoking rates among adults in Turkey remain much higher than the OECD average of 23.3%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>In Turkey, <strong>the obesity rate among adults</strong> - based on self-reported height and weight - <strong>was 15.2%</strong> in 2008. This is much lower than for the United States (27.5% in 2008), but still slightly higher than average for the 21 OECD countries with self-reported data (14.9% in 2008). Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>
<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>66% of people in Turkey reported to be in good health</strong>, lower than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use .

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. In 2010,<strong> life expectancy at birth in the United Kingdom was just over 80 years</strong>, in line with the OECD average. However, several major European countries – Italy, Spain, France and Germany – registered a higher life expectancy than the United Kingdom. Life expectancy for women is 83 years, compared with 79 for men, close to the OECD average of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Total health spending accounted for 9.8% of GDP in the United Kingdom</strong> in 2009, compared with an average of 9.7% across OECD countries. The United States is, by far, the country that spends the most on health as a share of its economy, with 16.0% of its GDP allocated to health in 2008. France and Switzerland followed with 11.2% and 10.7% respectively<strong>. In terms of per person spending on health, the United Kingdom is close to the OECD average (3060 USD in 2008), with spending of 3129 USD</strong> in 2008.</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has achieved some progress in reducing tobacco consumption, with <strong>current rates of daily smokers among adults standing at 22.0%</strong> in 2008, below the OECD average of 23.3%.</p>

																									<p><strong>Obesity rates in the United Kingdom are the highest in Europe, higher than the average of 17%</strong>. In England, rates have increased faster than in most OECD countries. Two out of three men are overweight and one in four people are obese in the United Kingdom.

																									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<p>Most OECD countries have enjoyed large gains in life expectancy over the past decades, thanks to improvements in living conditions, public health interventions and progress in medical care. While <strong>life expectancy in the United States</strong> used to be 1 ? year above the OECD average in 1960, it <strong>is now, at 79 years</strong>, close to the average of 80 years. Life expectancy for women is 81 years, compared with 76 for men, and compared with an OECD average of 83 years for women and 77 for men.</p>
<p>Higher life expectancy is generally associated with higher healthcare spending per person, although many other factors have an impact on life expectancy (such as living standards, lifestyles, education and environmental factors). <strong>Health spending accounted for 17.4% of GDP</strong> in the United States in 2009, by far the highest share in the OECD, and moer than seven percentage points higher than the average of 9.7% in OECD countries. Following the United States were France, Switzerland and Germany, which allocated respectively 11.2%, 10.7% and 10.5% of their GDP to health.</p>
<p><strong>The United States spent 7,538 USD on health per person</strong> in 2008, two-and-a-half times greater than the OECD average of 3,060 USD. Americans spent more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The United States spends much more on health than any other OECD country on a per capita basis and as a share of GDP. This higher expenditure can only be partly explained by the high income level of US citizens. The extra $750bn that America spends on health more than expected is not due to greater ‘need’ due to aging or sickness, but instead to higher prices for medical goods and services.</p>
<p>Throughout the OECD, tobacco consumption and excessive weight gain remain two important risk factors for many chronic diseases. In the United States, the proportion of adults who smoke daily has been cut by more than half over the past thirty years, falling from 33.5% in 1980 to 16.5% in 2008. This is the lowest rate among OECD countries (23.3% average) after Sweden. Much of this decline can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. Soaring obesity rates make the US the fattest country in the OECD. Overweight and obesity rates have increased steadily since the 1980s in both men and women. In the United States,<strong> the obesity rate among adults</strong> <strong>is of 33.8%</strong>. This is the highest rate among the 21 OECD countries with self-reported data, with an average of 14.9% in 2008. Three out of four people are projected by the OECD to be overweight or obese within 10 years. 40% of American children are currently overweight. Of these, half are obese -- the highest rate in the OECD.</p>
<p>Childhood obesity rates have become relatively stable in the last ten years, suggesting that substantial further growth is unlikely and overweight rates in boys might even begin to fall. Still, obesity’s prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems (such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and asthma), and higher health care costs in the future.</p>																							</div>
											<div class="middle">
																									<p>When asked, "How is your health in general?” <strong>90% of people in the United States reported to be in good health</strong>, much higher than the OECD average of 70%. Despite the subjective nature of this question, the answers have been found to be a good predictor of people’s future health care use . Gender, age and social status may affect answer to this question. On average in OECD countries, men are more likely to report good health than women, with an average of 72% for men and 67% for women. In the United States, the average is 91% for men and 89% for women. Not surprisingly, older people report poorer health, as do those who are unemployed, or who have less education or income. In 2010, a<strong>bout 96% of the top 20% of the adult population in the United States rated their health as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, compared to about 76% for the bottom 20%</strong>.</p>
<h2>Better Policies for Better Lives</h2>
<p><em>Reduce inefficiencies in healthcare to reduce spending</em></p>
<p>In most countries, health spending is largely financed out of taxes or social security contributions, with private insurance or ‘out-of-pocket’ payments playing a significant but secondary role. This is not the case in the United States where the government plays the smallest role in financing health spending. <strong>The public share of health expenditure in the United States was 46.5%</strong> in 2008, much lower than the OECD average of 72.8%.</p>
<p>However, the level of health spending in the United States is so high that public (i.e. government) spending on health per person is greater than in all other OECD countries, excepting only Norway and Luxembourg. For this amount of public expenditure in the United States, government provides insurance coverage only for the elderly and disabled people (through Medicare) and some of the poor (through Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, SCHIP), whereas in most other OECD countries this is enough for government to provide universal primary health insurance. Public spending on health in the United States has been growing more rapidly than private spending since 1990, largely due to expansions in coverage.</p>
