Thank you for referring this patient to me. He presents for assessment of an ulcerated lesion on the left ear which has been present for the past several months. The patient uses Dettol for cleansing the area. There is no previous history of cutaneous carcinoma and he has Type III pigmentation of the skin. His general health is very good and he takes no regular medication.
 
Exam: Revealed an 8 mm, irregular, superficial ulcer of the superior aspect of the left pinna. No obvious underlying pathology was present. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.
 
I believe this is an area of traumatic ulceration and slow healing, secondary to factors such as dessication and the use of Dettol. A biopsy specimen was obtained to rule out an underlying neoplasm and he was started on topical therapy with Fucidin ointment with further review in two weeks.


 Diagnosis: Traumatic ulceration of left ear. Differential diagnosis to include ulcerated basal cell carcinoma.
 
Plan: 1. A cutaneous biopsy specimen was obtained.
          2. Fucidin ointment applied t.i.d.
