Thank you for asking me to see this **patient. She gives a history of a lesion developing on the left lower eyelid. This has been asymptomatic. There is also a long-standing history of dermatitis symptoms involving the face, neck, and upper trunk. She does not recall any specific childhood atopy.
 
Exam: Revealed a small seborrheic keratosis of the left lower eyelid margin. There was also evidence of subacute dermatitis with erythema and scaling present on the face, neck, and left shoulder region.
 
No treatment was necessary for the small keratosis at present. I feel she most likely has adult atopic and irritant dermatitis but allergic contact dermatitis is also in the differential diagnosis. She will start on the above treatment measures with further review in one month.

 Diagnoses: 1. Seborrheic keratosis of left lower eyelid.
                       2. Dermatitis of face and upper trunk -- differential diagnosis to include atopic and irritant dermatitis versus allergic contact dermatitis.
 
Plan: 1. No treatment necessary for seborrheic keratosis.
          2. Westcort 0.2% cream applied b.i.d.
          3. Regular use of emolients.
          4. Patch testing in reserve.
