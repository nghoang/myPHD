Thank you for referring this patient to me. She presented one month ago with an inflammatory nodule of the nasal tip region. This has subsequently spontaneously resolved. She will also develop occasional acne pustules as well as comedones.
 
Exam: Revealed post-inflammatory erythema of the nasal tip. Comedonal and mildly inflammatory acne was seen on the forehead and nose.
 
She will start the above topical therapy with further review in two months as necessary.

 Diagnosis: Acne vulgaris.
 
Plan: Retisol-A 0.025% cream applied once daily.
