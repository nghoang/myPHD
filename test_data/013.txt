Thank you for sending along this pleasant patient for my assessment. He presents for assessment of a lesion which has been present on the left forehead just superior to the eyebrow since birth. This has become more raised and papular over the past 1-2 years. No other symptoms have been noted and there is no past history of other significant skin disorders.
 
Exam: Revealed a well-circumscribed, 1.3 x 0.9 cm yellow plaque with slight follicular prominence on the left supraorbital forehead. The remainder of the cutaneous examination was unremarkable.
 
Clinical findings are consistent with nevus sebaceous. There is an associated 10-15% risk of transformation into basal cell carcinoma with this lesion and I feel that prophylactic excision is advisable. I have taken the liberty of referring the patient to Dr. D. Ward for consideration of this procedure.

 Diagnosis: Nevus sebaceous of left forehead.
 
Plan: Arrangements will be made for plastic surgery referral for assessment of excision.
