Thank you for sending along this pleasant patient for my assessment. She presents for assessment of lesion developing on the left angle of the jaw for the past 3-4 years. This apparently has been treated on several occasions with cryotherapy without significant response. She has had a past history of actinic damage and has possibly had cutaneous carcinoma of the right lower eyelid region previously surgery excised. She has Type II pigmentation of the skin and had frequent sunburns in the past. Her health is stable, although she has a history of cardiomyopathy and is on numerous medications, including digoxin, Coumadin, a diuretic, and anti-hypertensive.
 
Exam: Revealed a 1.5 cm plaque with erythema and telangiectases on the left angle of the jaw. A 5-6 mm papule suspicious for basal cell carcinoma was seen on the right nasal bridge region. A previous surgical scar was present on the right lower eyelid without evidence of recurrence. Small actinic keratosis were also seen on the forehead and cheeks.
 
I feel that these two areas are suspicious for basal cell carcinoma. Biopsy will be performed and surgical excision will be arranged pending the biopsy report.

 Diagnoses: 1. Plaque of left angle of jaw -- differential diagnosis to include basal cell carcinoma and hypertrophic actinic keratosis.
                   2. Basal cell carcinoma of right nasal bridge.
 
Plan: Arrangements will be made for a cutaneous biopsy with further treatment pending results.
