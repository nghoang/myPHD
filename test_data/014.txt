Thank you for sending along this pleasant patient for my assessment. She has developed areas of pigmentation on the cheeks, upper lip and forehead regions for the past several years. This will darken during summer months. She will also notice comedones and acne pustules on the chin. She is not on any current treatment measures.

She will start the above topical therapy with further review in two months.

 Diagnoses: 1. Melasma.
                       2. Comedonal acne.
