Thank you for asking me to see this pleasant patient in re-referral. He was last assessed in December *****, in the interim training for *****, and is not involved in any other ****** activities at work.I previously performed patch tests and this was negative to baking set antigens, although he showed a mild reaction to mercapto mix which is an allergen found in rubber products. The patient states he does not wear latex or rubber gloves on a regular basis at present. He finds that he will develop persistent symptoms involving both the hands and feet with pruritic vesicles and subsequent scaling. He has also had some involvement of the wrists, and antecubital and popliteal fossae regions. He is not on any current treatment measures.
 
Exam: Revealed vesicles and erythema affecting the lateral aspects of the right third, fourth, and fifth fingers as well as the dorsal aspect of the right first toe. Subacute dermatitis with erythematous papules and scaling was seen on the volar right wrist as well as antecubital and popliteal fossae regions.
 
I believe this is an ongoing process of dyshidrotic and nummular dermatitis. He most likely has underlying atopic tendencies. I feel that irritant factors at work such as frequent hand-washing may exacerbate his symptoms but it does not appear that he has a specific contact allergy reaction. He was started on the above topical therapy and I have also suggested ongoing protectant measures with use of Prevex cream. He did not appear to require any absence from employment duties at present. He will return for further review in three weeks.

 Diagnosis: Dyshidrotic and nummular eczema.
 
Plan: Ultravate cream applied b.i.d. to involved areas of hands and feet.
