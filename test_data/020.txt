Thank you for asking me to see this patient. She gives a history of persistent hair-shedding for the past 1½ years. She also notices loss of hair volume and increased part-width of the hair. Her menstrual cycles are regular and she does not have a history of significant illnesses over the past one year. However, she apparently has been diagnosed with borderline hypothyroidism and is on a thyroid supplement at present. She statest hat a TSH level was checked two months ago. Review of the family history shows male pattern alopecia affecting her father and brother.
 
On examination, there was no visible thinning of the scalp hair evident and the frontal hairline was well preserved. There was no evidence of virilization. A gentle hair-pull test showed slightly increased telogen hairs, with 3-5 hairs per pull from both the frontal and occipital regions of the scalp.
 
I believe this is a process of telogen effluvium. This may be secondary to underlying thyroid abnormality and a repeat TSH will be performed. The differential diagnosis would include idiopathic chronic telogen effluvium as well as early androgenetic alopecia. Topical minoxidil therapy can be considered for both of these conditions pending results of laboratory investigations. She will return for further review in three weeks.

 Diagnosis: Telogen effluvium.
 
Plan: 1. TSH, ferritin, testosterone, and DHEAS levels to be obtained.
          2. Topical minoxidil therapy in reserve.
