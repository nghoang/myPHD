Thank you for referring this patient to me. He presents for assessment of dermatitis symptoms involving the trunk and extremities. He has an underlying history of ectodermal dysplasia with symptoms involving the teeth and hair. His mother states that he will sweat but she notices this primarily on the palms only. There have apparently been no previous episodes of hyperpyrexia. He has been on topical therapy with Elocom ointment with some improvement of symptoms in the past. He does not use any regular emollients. He also has an underlying history of mild asthma. Review of the family history shows ectodermal dysplasia, apparently affecting a maternal uncle as well as maternal grandmother.
 
Exam: Revealed a distinctive facies consistent with ectodermal dysplasia. Scalp hair was present but was slightly sparse. A conical upper incisor was present but the remaining dentition was missing. No keratoderma of the hands and feet were present. General xerosis of the skin was seen with scattered patches of dermatitis on the trunk and extremities.
 
The clinical findings would be consistent with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. This is inherited as an x-link recessive trait. Hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and would not be associated with teeth abnormalities. There is a risk of hyperpyrexia with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and this was discussed today with the patient's mother. He also has findings of atopic dermatitis and will start on the above topical therapy with further review in one month.

 Diagnoses: 1. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
                       2. Atopic dermatitis.
 
Plan: 1. 0.1% Celestoderm cream and ointment in equal parts applied b.i.d. to areas of dermatitis.
          2. Regular use of emolients.
          3. Measures were discussed to avoid heat and irritation of the skin.
