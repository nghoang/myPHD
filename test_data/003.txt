Thank you for asking me to see this patient in re-referral. She was last assessed in February and at that time, the area on the lower right leg had shown complete healing. I initially assessed her in November of 1997, and felt that inflammatory reaction may have represented an infected insect bite.
 
Exam: Revealed a 2.5 x 1.5 cm mildly atrophic scar with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. There was no evidence of an active inflammatory process.
 
I feel that this represents post-inflammatory changes with scarring and hyperpigmentation. No specific treatment measures were necessary.
 
Diagnosis: Atrophic scar and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation of right lower leg.
 
Plan: No treatment measures necessary.
