Thank you for asking me to see this pleasant patient and for your referral note and copies of previous investigations and consultations. She presents for assessment of multiple hypopigmented patches developing on the face, shoulders, and arms. She has a history of dry skin and apparently had episodes of dermatitis in earlier childhood. She will occasionally develop symptoms of pruritus and scaling. She has been on previous therapy with Topicort cream and will also use Prevex cream as an emollient to the lips. There is also a history of mild facial hirsutism but the patient did not present this as a concern today. Her menstrual cycles are irregular with oligomenorrhea. It should also be noted that she has had a weight gain of approximately 30 pounds over the past one year. Review of the family history is positive for atopy.
 
Exam: Revealed moderately-well-defined, hypopigmented, slightly scaling plaques on the face, shoulders,and arms. General xerosis of the skin was present. Thickening and hyperpigmentation of the neck and axillary folds was present, consistent with acanthosis nigricans. Mild hirsutism was evident on the lip and jawline regions.
 
I feel that the hypopigmented patches represent pityriasis alba. This represents post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, secondary to dermatitis which is usually seen in an atopic setting. She also has findings of mild acanthosis nigricans which I feel is likely secondary to her past weight gain. I did not feel that the mild hirsutism represented an endocrine abnormality and she has had previous screening investigations including DHEAS and testosterone levels which were normal. She was started on topical therapy for treatment of dermatitis with further review in one month.

 Diagnoses: 1. Pityriasis alba -- post-inflammatory hypopigmentation.
                       2. Acanthosis nigricans, secondary to weight gain and obesity.
 
Plan: 1. Regular use of emolients.
          2. Elocom 0.1% cream applied once daily to active areas of dermatitis.
