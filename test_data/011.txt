Thank you for referring this patient to me. He has a history of a lesion affecting the right anterior lower leg for the past eight months. This occasionally becomes tender and has also apparently shown drainage in the past. He denies a history of pruritus or excoriation. There is no past history of other significant skin disorders and his general health is good.
 
Exam: Revealed a small pustule with surrounding post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on the right anterior leg. The pustule was drained and a swab for wound culture was obtained. There did not appear to be any other underlying process at present. The remainder of the cutaneous examination was unremarkable.
 
I believe this is a small furuncle or possibly a foreign body reaction. He will start on simple topical therapy with further review in two weeks.

 Diagnosis: Pyoderma of right leg -- differential diagnosis to include furuncle and foreign body reaction.
 
Plan: Warm compresses followed by Bactroban ointment t.i.d.
