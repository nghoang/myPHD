Thank you for sending along this patient and for your helpful referral note. He presents for assessment of a recurrent dermatosis which first had its onset approximately one month ago. There do not appear to be any triggering factors at that time such as infection or new medications. He was treated with a course of systemic erythromycin and symptoms appeared to have resolved. However, he presents with recurrent pruritic plaques and wheals as well as deeper soft tissue swelling of the hands and feet. He has recently been started on Benadryl suspension with some improvement of symptoms. There have been no recent symptoms of fever, arthralgias, or other systemic symptoms. There is no past history of atopy or significant urticaria.
 
Exam: Revealed urticarial wheals with papules and plaques distributed over the trunk and extremities. Deeper soft tissue edema, consistent with angiodema was seen on the hands. No purpura or surface change was present.
 
Clinical findings are consistent with acute urticaria and angiodema. The lesions are transient and are not consistent with erythema multiforme. There does not appear to be any specific underlying etiology at present and he will start on therapy with H1 and H2 antihistamines. He will return for further review in one week.

 Diagnosis: Urticaria and angiodema.
 
Plan: 1. Atarax suspension, 10-20 mg q. i.d.
          2. Cimetidine suspension, 300 mg b.i.d.
