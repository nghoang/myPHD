Thank you for sending along this pleasant patient for my assessment. She presents for assessment of a lesion on the left extensor elbow which has been present for the past two years. This will occasionally become pruritic and irritated. There is no past history of other significant skin disorders and her general health is good.
 
Exam: Revealed a keratotic papule on the left extensor elbow. A benign compound nevus was seen on the left neck and the remainder of the cutaneous examination was unremarkable.
 
I believe this is a localized verruca and this was treated today with cryotherapy with further review on a p.r.n. basis.

 Diagnosis: Symptomatic verruca of left elbow.
 
Plan: Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy.
