Thank you for sending along this pleasant patient for my assessment. She presents for assessment of acne symptoms.She will develop papules and pustules as well as the occasional inflammatory nodule. She has previous been on systemic antibiotic therapy including erythromycin which she took for up to a two-month duration. She was also on topical vitamin A acid but found this to be too irritating. Her menstrual cycles are regular and she is on the oral contraceptive pill. She also gives a history of easy flushing and blushing of the face.
 
Exam: Revealed papules and pustules distributed on the forehead, cheeks and chin. Only a slight comedonal component was present.
 
I believe this is a combination of both rosacea and acne vulgaris. She will start on the above treatment measures with further review in two months.
 
Diagnosis: Rosacea and acne vulgaris.
 
Plan: 
1. Doxycycline, 100 mg daily.
2. 1 percent hydrocortisone, 1 percent clindamycin, 1 percent metronidazole in Complex 15 lotion applied b.i.d.
