Thank you for asking me to see this pleasant patient. She presents with acute symptoms of an inflammatory plaque and subsequent ulceration developing on the anterior right lower leg, approximately two weeks ago. She describes a similar episode with an inflammatory nodular lesion developing with subsequent ulceration approximately six months ago. This subsequently showed healing over a seven-week period. She was treated with systemic antibiotics at that time, although she states that this did not appear to show any significant effect. She has also been recently started on oral Keflex therapy. She describes quite significant tenderness associated with the lesion. She has not developed any systemic symptoms such as fever or arthralgia. There is no history of underlying inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, or other significant systemic disorder.
 
Exam: Revealed a 6 cm arcuate plaque. This showed a necrotic blue-grey centre with undermining as well as pustules at the periphery of the plaque. Secondary superficial ulceration was present. Healed, mildly-atrophic scars with post-inflammatory pigmentation were seen on the lateral aspect of the right leg.
 
The clinical findings are consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. There does not appear to be an underlying etiology at present. She was started on the above treatment measures with further review in five days.

 Diagnosis: Pyodermic gangrenosum.
 
Plan: 1. Investigations to include cutaneous biopsy, swab for culture, and CBC.
          2. Prednisone, 30 mg b.i.d.
          3. Topical therapy to consist of normal saline compresses followed by Polysporin ointment and non-adherent dressing.
