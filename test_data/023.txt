Thank you for sending along this patient who gives a history of ongoing symptoms of pustules affecting the scalp and face over the past several years. He has previously been treated with systemic minocycline and has also used topical erythromycin in the past. His general health is good and there is no past history of other significant skin disorders. His only current long-term medication is Vasotec.
 
Exam: Revealed follicular pustules affecting the temporal and occipital scalp regions. Inflammatory pustules and furuncles were also seen on the cheeks and temple regions. No comedones were present and there was no evidence of scarring affecting the scalp.
 
I believe this is a process of ongoing superficial folliculitis and furunculosis. A swab for culture was taken and he was started on the above systemic and topical therapy. Treatment for staph aureus carriage may beconsidered in the future if symptoms continue to recur. He will return for further review in two weeks.

 Diagnosis: Superficial folliculitis and furunculosis of scalp and face.
 
Plan: 1. Keflex, 500 mg b.i.d.
          2. 1% clindamycin in Dilusol lotion applied b.i.d.
