Thank you for asking me to see this pleasant patient and for your referral note. She presents for assessment of symptoms of hair-shedding and thinning noticeable over the past one year. She has not developed any areas of focal alopecia. Her menstrual cycles are regular and there is no history of significant acne or hirsutism. Her general health is good, although she has a history of previous schizophrenia and is on long-term Haldol, 1mg daily. Review of the family history is positive for androgenetic alopecia.
 
Exam: Revealed an increased frontal part-width and mild thinning of the frontal to vertex region of the scalp. A gentle hair-pull test showed 1-3 telogen hairs per pull. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.
 
I feel that this represents early androgenetic alopecia. Screening investigations including ferritin and TSH have been performed and are within normal limits. I do not feel that any further investigations are necessary at present. Topical minoxidil therapy was discussed and she will start on 5% solution with further review in six months.

 Diagnosis: Androgenetic alopecia.
 
Plan: 5% minoxidil solution applied b.i.d.
 
Thank you for referring this patient to me. He has a history of a lesion affecting the right anterior lower leg for the past eight months. This occasionally becomes tender and has also apparently shown drainage in the past. He denies a history of pruritus or excoriation. There is no past history of other significant skin disorders and his general health is good.
 
Exam: Revealed a small pustule with surrounding post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on the right anterior leg. The pustule was drained and a swab for wound culture was obtained. There did not appear to be any other underlying process at present. The remainder of the cutaneous examination was unremarkable.
 
I believe this is a small furuncle or possibly a foreign body reaction. He will start on simple topical therapy with further review in two weeks.

 Diagnosis: Pyoderma of right leg -- differential diagnosis to include furuncle and foreign body reaction.
 
Plan: Warm compresses followed by Bactroban ointment t.i.d.
