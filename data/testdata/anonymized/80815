Electrolytes were normal[patient]was initially admitted to the [SUPPRESSED] for[hypertension]and infectious[etiology]He was stabilized there and transferred to the[floor]within a few days . 
HOSPITAL[course]: 1 . 
Colitis , presumed infectious[etiology]descending and sigmoid[colon]Colitis was worse over the last[month]associated with[diarrhea]Abdominal[ct]is consistent with an infectious inflammatory[bowel]process . 
Given[history]of [SUPPRESSED][diff]colitis , C[diff]was the most likely infectious[etiology]but others were possible . 
Ischemic colitis was considered secondary to low forward[flow]given[patient]'s[cardiomyopathy]and low[ejection]fraction of 20 % to 35 % and he also got a[pattern]of inflammatory colitis or nonspecific colitis[stool]samples were sent for a C. diff[toxin]and[assay]and all were negative x at least 3 samples[stool]cultures were sent and did not grow anything out during[admission]Empiric[treatment]was started with p.o. vancomycin[patient]'s abdominal[pain]continued to improve and completely resolved . 
By discharge[patient]remained afebrile and white[blood]cell[count]decreased . 
Advance[patient]'s[diet]as tolerated and by discharge the[patient]was up to soft solids . 
We added[lactobacillus]p.o. for probiotics and[patient]also had[flex]sig two days before discharge , showing resolving[inflammation]consistent with colitis of inflammatory[etiology]The[flex]sig did not[change]his[management]We did discharge the[patient]on a 2-week[course]p.o[vancomycin]alone . 
2 . 
Coronary[artery]disease[patient]had no[evidence]for acute coronary[syndrome]on[admission]We continued his aspirin[plavix]statin and beta-blocker[patient]had no ischemic issues or coronary artery[disease]issues during his[admission]3 . 
CHF[patient]has previous[ef]noted at 20 % to 35 % , so a gentle hydration[therapy]at first in the [SUPPRESSED] for[hypertension]and then as[patient]'s[blood]pressure increased , was able to restart[patient]'s Lasix[dose]in[order]to diurese all of the extra[fluid]gained during the rehydration[therapy]was restarted on the[lasix]40 mg p.o. daily , his daily[dose]at home . 
Also considered restarting[lisinopril]but deferred discharge to[outpatient]follow up with primary[care]physician for restart of[lisinopril]once[patient]is fully recovered . 
4[chronic]kidney disease[patient]had a[baseline]of[creatinine]1.2 to 1.5 and he came into the[hospital]with a[creatinine]of 1.0 . 
The[patient]was below[baseline]and remained below[baseline]during[admission]He did not have any renal issues . 
5 . 
Hematology[patient]has a[history]a line-induced DVT , has been treated with[coumadin]with no definitive[evidence]as to how along[patient]should be treated , given that the DVT was line induced[coumadin]was therapeutic on[admission]became supertherapeutic in the [SUPPRESSED] . 
[SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] until INR fell below 3 , restarted[coumadin]afterwards at 6 mg p.o. daily[patient]'s normal[dose]Patient was therapeutic on discharge . 
Will[follow]up with primary[care]physician for[coumadin]monitoring .

PROCEDURES PERFORMED : The[patient]had a flexible sigmoidoscopy during the[admission]that showed colitis consistent with inflammatory[etiology]DIAGNOSIS :[patient]had repeated negative C. diff[toxin]assays , but colitis was presumed to be C[diff]and given[history]could have been other infectious or inflammatory etiologies[patient]continued to improve on[vancomycin]and thus was discharged with presumed C[diff]colitis[diagnosis]DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : Included[aspirin]81 mg p.o. daily[plavix]75 mg p.o. daily[digoxin]0.125 mg p.o. daily , [SUPPRESSED] 20 mg p.o. daily , Flovent 110[mcg]inhale[b]i.d[lasix]40 mg p.o. daily[lactobacillus]2 tabs p.o. t.i.d[metoprolol]25 mg p.o[b]i.d[simvastatin]80 mg p.o. at bed[time]Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. every evening[vancomycin]250 mg p.o. every 6 hours x8 days at discharge and[coumadin]5 mg p.o. every evening[patient]had to[follow]up with primary[care]physician[setup]for 2 to 3 weeks after discharge .
