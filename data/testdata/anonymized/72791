SECONDARY DIAGNOSES : Mitral[regurgitation]diabetes[hypertension]congestive[heart]failure[recurrent]UTIs , uterine[prolapse]hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast[nodule]HISTORY OF PRESENT[illness]: The[patient]is a 76-year-old with a[history]of severe mitral regurgitation[history]of congestive[heart]failure with an[ejection]fraction of 60 % in 7\/24[chronic]abdominal discomfort[history]of[recurrent]UTIs , and uterine[prolapse]who one[week]prior to[admission]developed increased[nausea]decreased[appetite]weakness[fatigue]and increased low back[pain]No vomiting[diarrhea]cough , or dysuria . 
On[presentation]the[patient]was found to be hypotensive , in septic[shock]with bacteremia in urinary[tract]infection and admitted to the Medical ICU for[pressure]support[admission]PHYSICAL[examination]: Notable for[heart]rate of 94[blood]pressure of 80-90\/50 . 
Notable for[heart]exam with regular[rate]and[rhythm]normal[s1]and[s2]with 3\/6[systolic]crescendo[murmur]and decrescendo[murmur]at the right upper sternal[border]radiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3\/6 holosystolic[murmur]at the[apex]radiating to the[axilla]and an apical[heave][SUPPRESSED] flat[chest]with crackles in the right middle[lung]fields and[leg]basilar crackles . 
Abdominal[exam]was benign . 
Guaiac negative . 
Extremities with no[clubbing]cyanosis , or[edema]and 1 + dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally . 
RELEVANT STUDIES AND TESTS :[blood]culture on 9\/10 Streptococcus viridans[levofloxacin]sensitive[penicillin]MIC 0.19[urine]culture on 9\/10 Greater than 100 , 000 Klebsiella[pneumoniae]ampicillin[resistant]gentamicin sensitive , and[levofloxacin]sensitive[tee]on 0\/14 Severe mitral regurgitation[posterior]leaflet with mitral calcifications and linear[density]concerning for endocarditis . 
HOSPITAL[course]:[impression]: A 76-year-old[female]with mitral regurgitation[history]of CHF[history]of[recurrent][SUPPRESSED] , who presented with[nausea]and chills , had[hypotension]requiring a medical ICU[stay]x 2 days , with Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitral calcifications in linear[density]concerning for endocarditis plus [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] . 
1 . 
Infectious[disease]: The[patient]presented with chills and[hypotension]and was admitted to the MICU from the ED for[treatment]of septic[shock]Her mean arterial pressures were kept above 65 with Levophed . 
She initially was treated with[levofloxacin]and[vancomycin]to treat Gram-positive cocci bacteremia and [SUPPRESSED][blood]culture from 10\/22 , grew out Streptococcus viridans[levofloxacin]sensitive[penicillin]MIC 0.19[urine]culture was positive for[klebsiella]ampicillin[resistant]gentamicin and[levofloxacin]sensitive . 
On 3\/18 , antibiotics were changed to[penicillin]3 million units[iv]q[4h]and[gentamicin]50 mg[iv]q. 8h . 
[SUPPRESSED] on 10\/19 showed severe mitral[regurgitation]with[posterior]leaflet calcifications and linear[density]concerning for endocarditis . 
Therefore , a [SUPPRESSED] line was placed on 1\/19 for[continuation]of a six-week[course]of[penicillin]3 million units[iv]q[4h]until 0\/12 and two-week[course]of[gentamicin]50 mg[iv]q. 8h . 
until 2\/25 . 
She will[follow]up in the Infectious[disease]Clinic with [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] on 0\/9\/05 at 8 a.m. 2 . 
Cardiovascular : Ischemia : The[patient]was maintained on[aspirin]Lipitor was initially helped for an initial transaminitis presumed to be secondary to[shock]liver , that at the[time]of discharge her[liver]enzymes had normalized and she was restarted on her Lipitor[pump]: The[patient]has a[history]of congestive[heart]failure , with an[ejection]fraction 60 % in 7\/24 . 
She had[hypotension]requiring Levophed until 11\/0 . 
She had an[episode]of[flash]pulmonary[edema]on 11\/9 in the[setting]of[fluid]bolus and one[unit]of packed red[blood]cells . 
She has a very attenuatus[balance]between preload[dependence]and[overload]Her[lasix]and ACE-I were held while she was hypotensive . 
Because her systolic[blood]pressure continued to be low in the 90s and low 100s[attempt]was not made to re-add the[ace]while in the[hospital]It is anticipated that her[cardiologist]and[outpatient]physicians will[attempt]to add the[ace]back onto her medical regimen for better[afterload]reduction as her[blood]pressure tolerates . 
The[patient]also has a very severe mitral[regurgitation]which would be one of the reasons that an[ace]on her[medication]regimen would be beneficial[rhythm]: The[patient]was maintained on[telemetry]and was found to be a normal sinus[rhythm]with ectopy , including short once of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia . 
She was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. on 3\/18 , and this was increased to 25 mg[b]i.d. at discharge , with her[heart]rates continuing to be between the 70s and the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy . 
Her electrolytes were also well repleted . 
3 . 
Gastrointestinal : The[patient]had[evidence]of[shock]liver -LRB- 0\/24 with an ALT of 135 , [SUPPRESSED] of 177 , alkaline[phosphatase]of 251 , and T bili of 1.7 -RRB- that is now resolving . 
Lipitor was held , and was started as a transaminitis resolved . 
Non-contrast[ct]of the abdomen showed biliary[sludge]and gallstones , no[evidence]of acute cholecystitis . 
Right upper quadrant[ultrasound]confirmed the[ct]findings[colon]cancer is a[concern]with the[patient]'s anemia being new since 0\/29 . 
Her last[colonoscopy]was in 2000 , and she will[benefit]from repeat[colonoscopy]as an[outpatient]She was continued on Nexium for prophylaxis . 
Heme : The[patient]had guaiac positive stools in the medical ICU , her[hematocrit]was[stable]around 33 % . 
She has a microcytic anemia with an [SUPPRESSED] of 79 , her[iron]studies -LRB-[iron]of 10 , TIBC of 191[ferritin]is 744 -RRB- suggesting anemia of chronic[disease]with possibly overlying[iron]deficiency . 
4[endocrine]: The[patient]had a normal random[cortisol]level of 35.3 . 
She had an uncertain[diagnosis]of diabetes and was on the [SUPPRESSED][protocol]in the medical ICU[hemoglobin]A1c , however , was 6.5 . 
Therefore , she was maintained thereafter only on[insulin]sliding[scale]and rarely required any[coverage]5 . 
Prophylaxis : The[patient]was kept on Lovenox and Protonix . 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :[aspirin]81 mg daily[iron]sulfate 325 mg daily[gentamicin]sulfate 50 mg[iv]q. 8h . 
until 2\/25 for a two-week[course]penicillin G[potassium]3 million units[iv]q[4h]until 0\/12 for a six-week[course][SUPPRESSED] 25 mg[b]i.d. , Caltrate plus D2 tablets p.o. daily , [SUPPRESSED] 10 mg daily , and [SUPPRESSED] 40 mg daily . 
The[patient]has not been restarted on her home[lasix]and[lisinopril]secondary to persistently low[blood]pressures between the 90s and 100s . 
It is anticipated that especially her[lisinopril]and her[lasix]will be added back on to her medical regimen as her[blood]pressure tolerates . 
Given that she was no longer on[lasix]she was also taken[potassium]chloride[disposition]: The[patient]is to be discharged to[rehabilitation]at [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] [SUPPRESSED] in[order]to be able to get her antibiotic[therapy]She was discharged on stable[condition]PHYSICIANS FOLLOW-UP : The[patient]has been following follow-up appointments : 1 .

She will require weekly[lab]draws to[check]her electrolytes and [SUPPRESSED] while she is on the antibiotics .
