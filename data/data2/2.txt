FRENCH DESIGNER Roland Mouret became synonymous with "the dress" when the Galaxy, a nipped and tailored sheath from his spring 2006 collection, appeared on the runway. It managed the rare feat of flattering nearly all figures, and quickly became a go-to red-carpet look for actresses like Rachel Weisz, Scarlett Johansson and Halle Berry. Nevertheless, since becoming creative director of 34-year-old French women's footwear brand Robert Clergerie last year, Mr. Mouret's focus has been the shoe.
